{"id": "d8911k0", "body": "It's hard to say. And by that I mean the only hard part is that their FB has 63,000 likes and there is a respectable amount of activity and interaction with followers. That's a good sign, *BUT* most of their followers don't really appear to be purchasers. Just likers of elephants and shit.\n\n The few people I ran across (this was not an extensive search) that have purchased from R-S-T expressed that their merchandise never came; some of these same people later updated to say it eventually did. They expressed that they were satisfied with what came.\n\n Other than that, both the FB and the website are like 4 months old and I have yet to find any online reviews. R-S-T is also just a Shopify, so while the site looks nice and they appear to speak non-scammy english, there's no telling. There's also no other way to contact them than through their social media or email address. \n\n I think there's a fair chance that they are safe and you might further verify this by checking to see if Shopify offers any sort of buyer protection. However, I wouldn't order from them myself and my advice is that you don't either, especially if you're on the \"these prices are too good to be true\" ship, which is pretty exclusively the sinking ship in all online transactions. I can't offer input about their prices because I didn't attempt to price check more than a few of their items before getting distracted by that thing they do where they photo shop their merchandise onto existing (sometimes stock) photos of other shiza. That's not necessarily indicative of a scam, but it turns me off every time. I also found some cross over from them between sites like Aliexpress and Amazon, where the merchandise was being marketed using the same photo. That also is not indicative of a definite scam (in fact, everything you buy has to come from *somewhere* and I'm not above purchasing an item for a more expensive price if I think doing so will provide protections that purchasing from the source doesn't...if you can't tell, this is all AKA \"*I feel a way about Aliexpress...*\").

{"id": "d8bxwj6", "body": "/u/yerich's two-step guide to landing a software engineering job:\n\n1. Be a good software engineer.\n2. Don't be a bad software engineer.\n\nNow most real world jobs are filled by referral but the software engineering industry has so many unfilled positions that companies spent lots of time considering external applicants. Lucky you! This is what good developers have:\n\n1. Solid experience. Companies are usually willing to overlook a low amount of work experience for interns and entry-level positions if you have some personal projects. And not some half-assed default-Bootstrap-template website, a bona-fide product that people would actually want to use.\n\n2. Solid technical skills. Covered mostly by bullet point one, but marks, research, personal projects, etc. will cover this too. Though for most jobs it's just checking off a \"can program and learn new stuff\" box, being a super code wizard is not required.\n\n3. Solid soft/social skills. No one is going to admit to being a poor collaborator on their resume. So recruiters and interviewers have to tease it out of you during the interview. Being cocky, refusing advice, lying and not admitting to mistakes are huge red flags. Not being able to properly articulate ideas would also be concerning. Not caring about the company or product at all would also be bad. Simply having applied to the company because they're in California is a terrible reason also.\n\nThat's really about it. I haven't met anyone who was competent enough to get a good job and failed to find one. There are no secrets here: if you are competent, in this job market you will find a good job.\n\n*To answer your question specifically, my fifth coop was at Riot Games, and my sixth was at LinkedIn. Before that I spent time at Shopify and Khan Academy. My projects included Imprint's current CMS, a League of Legends analytics site and various other smaller things.

Magento can be more automated but the implementation cost is higher, and usually harder to maintain.\n\nBefore we go further, ourselves and the companies who produce the implementation platforms have stopped new installs until Feb/Mar next year, they can have a site running in under 1wk but it is likely you will not see a return on investment this year due to the upcoming holidays and that sites need time to gain traction, so better for you to concentrate on existing sales at the moment.\n\nWhen you have an implementation company you have a problem that they can spin out the time to justify the cost, for example a site can be running in weeks and they will quote months. You don't need any special extras with existing eCommerce platforms, you can launch on a simple site and it is often more effective than a semi-custom solution.\n\nShopify simplifies this as you have limited implementation scope, however that is also a problem as you have to do it their way. Shopify &amp; WooCommerce are business focused eCommerce, Magento is technology focused, and the top platforms like Hybris and Demandware are productivity focused.\n\nIt sounds given your product volume and fashion, one of our specialties, you would be better with fixed platforms such as Shopify or WooCommerce or very simple Magento, the latter would provide you more options later on without changing platforms. If you need to auto upload the supplier data it becomes complex without the correct tools, it's important as you need volume as a wholesaler.\n\nNot sure where you are getting the 5figure design from, would presume a custom theme. If the launches hadn't been shut down last week would have been able to drop in WooCommerce for $2k and a Magento site for $4k. The latter would have provided a foundation for the coming years which could be built out as you go along.\n\nWould suggest you find the cheapest and quickest way to launch, you will have many other things to worry about and the eCommerce is just one small part of launching a business.

{"body": "Hi, first up \u2013 congratulations on launching! A lot of people have ideas, you've actually executed on them and managed to bring something to market, which is a great achievement in itself!\n\nNow, you've actually gotta make those sales though. Here's some tips.\n\n* Take all the advice given in previous comments about cleaning up the site. Make everything legit. Work on making your product photos consistent etc. You're obviously on a budget but just try to keep consistency at a high.\n* Since you've got a small product line, try to get all the products on to the Home page. It took me a couple of minutes of snooping to realise the striped tights (which I think are the best item of your brand) were for sale. I thought you were only selling the tops.\n* Don't bother with traditional FB/Twtr/Instagram ads, they're a waste of money for smaller companies. I think the best strategy you'll find at the moment is called 'Influencer Marketing' \u2013 target some people local to you and within your target market that have an IG following of 10k+ and give them some free product in exchange for an Instagram shoutout.\n* Don't focus on attracting a mass market yet, you're in absolutely no place to try to take on Nike, Lululemon etc. Focus on grabbing the attention of a small niche, local market and providing them with the best experience you possibly can. Do as much work to make this small, core market LOVE your brand and become advocates for it. \n* Spend time and money on your product packaging. Your sales are going to be extremely low for the next few months (sorry to break it to you) so for the few people who actually do spend their money on your product, you should try to make the experience for them as amazing as possible! Fork out on nice packaging, wrapping inserts etc. Add hand written thank you notes, and think about including gifts, treats or coupons with every order. \n* Create content around your brand. Add a blog to your Shopify site by either using the built in blogging capabilities or adding a Wordpress blog to *blog.tigressapparel.co.uk* and then write articles. It should be pretty easy to come up with lots of article ideas around your brand and share them on your Facebook etc. (workout plans, meal plans, general workout articles and definitely things about Tigers!)\n* also make sure you're using Snapchat to also promote the brand", "id": "d8evnc1", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1475668111, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_55ydi3", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1478374024, "author": "alwaysnever__", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t3_55ydi3"}

They need to manage cashflow just like any business, and an un-guaranteed future commission payment is not a normal component of a deal at this level. \n\nThe standard way to go about this (and the one I recommend) is that you should find a freelance dev with ecommerce experience to build a site, (there are plenty here, on r/magento, r/woocommerce, probably even r/shopify) and then a freelance digital marketer or agency to handle marketing.  You can find those types on inbound.org, growthgeeks.com, or upwork.com. \n\nIn each case I would be prepared to pay at least a few thousand to get up and running and another $1-2K per month as work continues.  It's possible to do it for less, or with a commission/percentage-based deal - but generally professionals (who depend on their fees to make a living) can't accept commission-only deals.  Which leaves you with non-professionals...\n\nMy experience with commission-only deals (Yes, I've attempted this in the past myself) is that people will happily sign up to make an effort, and then *literally* nothing happens.  The work simply doesn't get done. Without a concrete quid-pro-quo and a concrete timeline, people can't commit the time to an uncertain payout.  In retrospect, I should not have tried it.

This resulted in around 40 sales per month and a gross profit of around $800. \n\nIn year two they focused on growing their catalog, number of pinterest followers, capturing emails and tightening those two funnels (optimizing the email sequence, up-selling, cross-selling, promotions). By the end of year two they had 10,000 pinterest followers, 800 email subscribers and were making around 120 sales per month. Gross profit was around $2200. \n\nOnly now are they really focusing on diversifying their marketing channels. \n\nI presume that they came from a similar spot as you.

You shouldn't have to show or tell anyone anything if you're just dropping off packages.\n\nIf you plan on purchasing anything wholesale from a supplier, you'll need a registered business, but if you're not, you can probably start without registering. \n\nYou can use small priority flat rate boxes from USPS. You can get them delivered to your door absolutely free from their site. They cost like $5-6 to ship anywhere in the US. So, if you don't want to spend any money on packaging, you can start for free. (The boxes seal themselves, so no need for tape either.)\n\nCheck out ebay for your bakery bags. You might be able to find them there for cheaper than uline + free shipping.\n\nI don't really think that you're \"in over your head\", but you should definitely do a lot of research to avoid any wasteful spending. Also, setting up the business will be the easy part, but marketing it and getting people to buy your stuff is going to be the hard part.

{"body": "Hey, there! Lots of good information here. Let me share some of mine.  \nCottage foods laws are incredibly restrictive. You are very limited to where you can sell your products. It must be direct to consumer, and cottage foods laws explicitly forbid shipping or internet sales. There are people who monitor this market heavily, and going against those laws can land you in some hot water. I recommend reading up on your state's laws [here]---LINK--- before proceeding.  \nThat said, selling food online is legal, if you have the right permits. Contact your state's department of agriculture for which permit(s) you'll need to move forward. In my state, I needed a food processor's license- which did require me to work from a licensed commercial kitchen. We cut down on that cost when starting up by renting space from a local donut shop.   \nContact some local businesses, the more mom-and-pop-ish, the better. You'll likely find someone in your area who's willing to rent out their kitchen to you for a reasonable price. Please note that they will need to provide you room to store your goods and ingredients, or you'll have to find an approved food storage facility. It's possible to use a designated part of your home as a food storage facility, but you'll need to have an inspector come out and permit it as such. Food storage facility permits are pretty strict, so look up your local laws for those if you're considering using a different space.  \nIf you're selling online and you're getting the proper permits to do so (*you should really really really get the proper permits to do so*), you'll need to have state-approved labels for all of your products. These need to include full breakdown of all the ingredients, ingredient sub-components, a physical address, net weight by grams/ounces, and a few other things I may be forgetting off of the top of my head.   \nYou'll also need FDA approved food packaging materials. You're looking in the right direction with ULine for these materials, but it's not cheap, as you'll be ordering in bulk. \nBasically, do a TON of research. \n\nTo your questions:   \n1. Absolutely, 100% register your business name. This is part of the process of getting your state business license, which you need in order to do business or get the aforementioned licenses required to open up. I can't answer part two for you without knowing a bit more about your goals and personal experience.   \n2. Again, this is something that's a personal preference type thing. I'm a big old wordpress fan, and would typically recommend investing in a non-default premium theme. But since I know money is an issue, Etsy or Shopify are also decent options.  \n3. USPS doesn't really care if you ship cookies. However, the state Department of Agriculture does not allow people to sell food through the mail or online without proper permitting. Cottage foods laws do not exempt you from this.  \n4. Not to my knowledge. But there are label printing services that allow you to create labels online. UPrinting has good prices.  \n5. UPrinting  \n5. YES. If you're doing business, you need a tax ID. This is the one piece of paperwork you'll get from the government that's free ;)  \n6. **Am I in over my head as a beginner?** \nYUP! \nAll in all, with all permits, all ingredients, the rent for the kitchen, marketing, website stuff, packaging, labeling, appliances, bakeware, etc., we started our business for about $7,000... and we were super stingy with our spending.  \nIf this is something you're passionate about, do it. But *please* do research, particularly in regards to the legality of what you're hoping to do. And don't be afraid to be honest with yourself about the cost of starting up this business. If it's something you're going to pour your heart into, you can't risk being not being financially prepared for the investment you're about to make.   \n\nIf, after hearing the reality of it all, this is something you're still interested in, please feel free to reach out to me. There's not really a how-to list online for the kind of market you're tapping into.

I haven't used shopify or etsy, but wordpress is the best way to get a website to your liking, however, there is probably more upfront work to do.

Vistaprint does quite a lot of different printing things and is reasonable in price.\n\n\n5b. Whether you want to do a sole proprietorship or LLC, you can use a EIN.

{"id": "d8ijyw4", "body": "I was recently asked how Rage On get away with selling Star Wars designs.\n\nHere's the low-down:\nThey had an artist from another country design it (Antoni Tudisco) with a contract putting the weight of it on him. Then when they were moving from Boston to Ohio, they were told by JakPrints they couldnt continue to produce copyrighted designs. So they got their own printers and space in Akron, Ohio just to produce the illegal works. They may now just have those produced in China even.\nThen the next step of theirs was to avoid being held liable for posting the artworks initially. After they got enough Shopify takedown notices to Let's Rage Clothing (their first store), they made fake stores and fake brands under their new \"superstore\", Rage On, just to say that other brands are the ones stealing the works. Then they began encouraging everyone who has a complaint to contact their \"legal department\" instead of Shopify. Now they have their own marketplace much like etsy to ensure the copyright violations fall on those who submit the stolen art and not Rage On. However, they encourage their team to steal art as they then continue to blame it on others. the path to fight them is now so lengthy and expensive that most people are just happy getting their works taken down and will never take it any further legally.\nHow do they deal with artists they work with already who catch them stealing or want to leave the site? -- Recently they've been claiming to artists that China are stealing their designs and putting them on Alibaba. At least they've told that to a former top-tier artist on their site after he has repeatedly asked them to remove his works from their store. I can only assume they're still making money off his works in another market. Because.... How long would it take to prove its China doing it? regardless of whether rage on are still profiting from their $9 on alibaba, we know they're the ones who gave the files to China in the first place.\nYour best bet as an artist is to entirely avoid these scumbags and to make damn sure you have your works copyrighted.\n\n", "subreddit": "Overwatch", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2u5kl", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1475881523, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4o0t24", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1478438275, "author": "infinitebit", "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_4o0t24"}

{"id": "d8imqx4", "body": "I'm not saying it isn't a valid question, just making sure I'm definitely following you. In the IT business I get a lot of requests based on someone thinking a term means something else. So I clarify out of habit. As for whether it's a valid venture or not, that's up to you. To address your questions:  \n  \n* There are tons of options out there for taking payments with varying levels of flexibility for integrations. It really depends on what you're looking to get out of it and how much you're comfortable with in fees. Paypal. Quickbooks. Stripe. Rerun. Stripe and Rerun have an API so you can connect pretty much anything with a little work. Ecommerce platforms like Shopify have their own options included. Also check with your local bank or credit union; they may have merchant services options as well.  \n  \n* Allocating your revenue will depend a bit on your location. For an example, I take 50% as my income. 15% gets set aside for taxes (which gets close enough to what my actual liability comes out to). 30% gets set aside for expenses. The last 5% goes into a profit account for planned big spending, a rainy day splurge, whatever. I do this twice a month.   \n  \n* If you're in the US, you'd be a sole proprietor by default, so there's no real boundary between you and the business. To pay yourself, you just draw from the account. Using defined allocations helps keep some sort of control and metric to track everything by.  \n  \n* Managing all of this is where you get into a bit of trouble. A content management system can be used as a the framework for the site as a whole, with plugins for user accounts and such. Tying it into managing subdomains, you'd need a domain registrar with an API you can tie into.

{"body": "The following are just my off the cuff opinions. I'm just starting out myself.\n\nTo be honest, the aesthetic of the site looks very amateur at the moment. The font of the fall sale, the cut out of the corgi with the cartoon leaves\u2014it all looks a bit \"Support the local middle school bake sale\" flyer to me. Look at other pet stores or pet blogs online, and they will have lots of big cute photos with simple beautiful fonts.\n\n* I would use more high quality corgi photos (you use shopify, so having a slideshow of beautiful corgi photos would do you well). Want to advertise a fall sale? How about a corgi running in foliage, for example? \n\n* I might add some flavor text. You are all corgi lovers, so you should be able to write an authentic call to action.\n\n* The toys section is full of plushies. I might change the name. As an adult, I don't look for toys. If I loved corgies and were into that sort of thing, I might look for plushies or dolls or something. These are more like decorations on someone's office desk, not a toy to play with.\n\n* I might change \"apparel\" to \"clothing\". It reads a little easier.\n\n* \"Cool stuff\" sounds a bit cheesy to me. But more than that, it's pretty vague. I don't know if I have reason to click on it.\n\n* You might want to consider one of the other free shopify themes, like the one that lists the categories along the left side, rather than along the top.\n\n* Your prices seem really low. You're selling an oil painted canvas for $13? Why not $30 or $40? It's a giant painting. A fabric poster for $5.53? That should be maybe $20, even if it's small. I know these are cheap on aliexpress or whatever, but you have an interested audience here. (And getting new customers is expensive and time consuming. You'll need more value out of your clicks if you want to stay alive.)\n\n* I couldn't stop thinking about your 30k followers. That is a gold mine. If you have even a 1% conversion rate, that's 300 sales and word of mouth straight outta the gate. But given that they're already corgi lovers, you potentially could have a much higher conversion rate and loyal customers.

{"body": "SEO is nice but in the long run, sales are what matter imo. I say this because people focus on the wrong things. Generally, if you have good content and focus on converting eyeballs to sales you'll be okay. Conversely, if you focus on SEO and don't get sales then you're just getting a ton of unprofitable traffic.\n\n\n\nSo the reason why you don't want to sell on a landing page is based on the sales pipeline. Generally when online, people won't make a purchase immediately. Excluding impulse buys.\n\n\nIf you've  seen Glengary Glen Ross, then you'll have an idea of the Attention&gt;Interest&gt;Decision&gt;Action process in sales. You stat by capturing attention. Then you get prospects who are interested interacting with your brand. This interest is where the landing page comes in. Generally, people who are at your landing page are in the interest/attention stage. And at that stage you *could* get them to make a decision but it's not the best ROI if you go that route. \n\n\nLet me explain why. You can either force the customer to make a purchasing decision (high cost) or simply give up their email (low cost). When it comes to sales, you want the customer to have minimal expenditure. I don't want to pay money for something. But if I give you an email address for something of value, that builds my stake in your brand and takes me down the road towards a purchase. Baby steps!\n\n\nSo that's why I'd recommend not selling right away. You want to build trust with customers and show your brand's value. You can't do that if you ask for money right away. Well you can, but it's significantly more challenging and you have to be a great product or service in the eyes of your consumer (although if you are, they probably would buy right away anyway).\n\n\nMy advice - don't focus on selling right away. Sign people up for an email list and keep in touch with them.  SHOW THEM VALUE. Why sell someone 1 book when you can sell them a whole series over years? \n\n\nAs for the page you linked, it definitely needs some work. If you're sending people to that link from AdWords then you need to make it  a traditional landing page. That means you need to drill down to who you're selling to and what their pain point is. \n\n\nAs for your last concern, credibility can't ever be overthought. Especially online. People want to know their information is secure. That's why we tend to trust websites like Amazon over smaller niche Ecommerce sites. However, value trumps everything. If you can demonstrate how your product or service makes the customers life easier they'll buy 9/10 times. End of story.\n\n\nSome surefire ways to increase your online checkouts:\n\n\n1) Lots of those trust factor badges touting hpps secure or paypal checkout and so on\n\n\n2) follow the standards seen on Amazon and the main ecommerce guys. Don't reinevent the wheel\n\n\n3) explain exactly what makes your checkout secure in your FAQ. people might check their first. Use a trusted third party to process credt card payments if you don't have paypal. I think shopify has a good resource on how to improve your checkout otherwise google search \"how to improve checkout conversions\" for loads of solid tips. \n\n\nAt the end of the day, test a few strategeies and stick with what works for you :)\n", "id": "d8ko082", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1476035138, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_55zsyi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1478474931, "author": "blueprint71", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t1_d8jc8yy"}

{"id": "d8mrtc2", "body": "(2/5) My Teespring campaign was unsuccessful for a number of reasons. One reason it was unsuccessful had to do with the fact that the cost of the shirt was too damn high for a casual consumer. I was trying to sell these shirts for $18.99, and I had no brand recognition. I had nobody modeling these shirts in the actual ad (because I had no physical shirts), so each picture was that of a mockup. The Teespring website also reeked of amateurity, so the people who actually clicked on the ad were probably turned off to actually purchasing a shirt.\n\nI probably spent about $20 on those ads. Not a big sum of money by any means, but it still hurt. I decided that I wanted to do this right, so I scoured Craigslist to find a local screenprinter. I actually met up with this great guy who could print 50 shirts for a reasonable price.  The payments hurt because I was unsure if I was going to make any money selling this product, but I did it anyway. In my opinion, it\u2019s so much easier to sell your product if you have physical inventory. Nothing motivates me to sell my product more than waking up and seeing this massive box of clothes in your room. \n\nI began to design my website while my product was being printed. I have many years of basic website coding experience, so my website didn\u2019t take too long to make. I wanted the website to be super simple with an eye-catching aesthetic, and I believe I succeeded in my endeavors. Many streetwear websites use simple shopify or wordpress templates, and they look like of cheesy and unprofessional. My website does not look as nice as some of the prebuilt templates, but one can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s unoriginal. I also like to add goofy easter eggs to my websites (only one person has told me that they\u2019ve viewed the source on LUNAR.'s index page). \n\nDetermining the price of my shirts was one of the trickiest parts of this entire story. I wanted cheap prices, so I slashed the shirt\u2019s prices as much as I could without taking a loss. I personally think it\u2019s remarkable that we got the shirts down to $11.99. Many people have told me that this was the number one reason they bought a shirt from my startup. \n\n", "subreddit": "streetwearstartup", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2z6wn", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1476152055, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_56vu3z", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1478511555, "author": "legrolls", "edited": 1476152880, "parent_id": "t3_56vu3z"}

{"body": "During the industrial revolution, manufacturing moved from cottage industry labor to factories. At the time, it was standard to acquire your job skills through an apprenticeship of some kind. With the advent of large machines for the mass production of goods, there had to be a shift in how skills were acquired. The apprentice-ship style vocational jobs skills training was adapted. In the span of four generations, the focus on training has shifted away from vocational-style programs and internships. Post-secondary university education was the goal, but academia trains people to think, not to work.\n\nThat's one of many things that got lost in the past 4-5 decades. Another other thing is \"work sample testing.\" The technological revolution where dot coms sprouted up and got cash dumped on them has produced a culture (ick) of Yay Easy Money, where everyone is wary of the old, slow ways of doing business. It surprises me how few people are familiar with the concept of \"horse trading.\" A century from now, the same concept will be called \"technical recruiting.\"   \n\nAs a co-founder of Starfighter, I got to stick my toe in the brackish and muddy waters of technical hiring. We have been building, and continue to build what is, effectively, work sample testing for hiring development and infosec in the form of capture the flag challenges. Ours are based on work we've done in the past and they are calibrated to shake out people who can code to solve problems. \n\nWhat I learned from this experience is that the people doing the hiring have no f-----g clue what they're doing.

{"body": "Well, first of all you don't quite give enough information to us that someone might could be helpful to you - where are you located?  Do you have any experience or contacts in this area?  Are you doing all the development yourself?  Where is your marketing going to be targeted?  What budget do you have for development, SEO, PPC, etc?  How much time do you have to dedicate to your growth?  \n\nAll of these are crucial questions - you cannot simply arrange a supplier, build yourself a shopify store for $30/month (or whatever it is), start a facebook page, then open for business and expect any growth at all.  If you goal is to maybe make a sale a month then you may do that, but as a business where you are accountable for growth and the bottom line (and assuming you actually *want* to be successful) then you need to be prepared to put in *a lot* of work - daily.  \n\nNot to dissuade you, but stores like this open every day.  Dozens, perhaps hundred of them.  Every day.  Most will never do more than open their ecom site and a facebook page and wonder why they are not getting any hits (or sales).  The ones that break out and actually make someone some money are the ones that the owner has dedicated himself (herself) to making it work through research, dedication, and consistent hard work.  Everyone starting out thinks that if they design a site that looks better than someone else, people will buy from them.  You have to remember that it isn't necessarily a contest between you and the guy beside you, it is really a contest for visibility, Google rank, reputation, and word of mouth; not if you have more stuff or even a cheaper price than the other guy.  If he is on page 6 of search results and you are on page 2, you already have him beat in a lot of ways.  \n\nAlso consider this - you ask a very fair question, but who do you think is going to answer you with their success story in the same market, and then tell you who the good suppliers are?  If someone tells you a good supplier for such goods without much research on your part, then chances are that there are a hundred others using the same supplier.  Here is where it will pay off to get your hands dirty and do some digging.  Do an exhaustive search for such suppliers, make some phone calls, send emails, etc.  Don't expect to have all this done in only a few days; take your time and make sure you have made the right contacts and decisions, and proceed from there.  \n\nBest to you - I hope you find success.  But know going in that 'starting' a drop shipping store is relatively easy - making it a success so that you haven't completely wasted your time, that's the part that takes time, work, and patience.  *spelling", "id": "d8q6n4l", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "edited": 1476372314, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1476364237, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_579zfx", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1478571113, "author": "qverb", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t3_579zfx"}

Magento is a very complex system and installing a security patch sometimes can take days of full time work. Even with a fully patched system chances of being hacked are fairly high because more popular stores are very profitable targets for attackers trying to steal CC information.

Of those, a whopping 2 have gone close enough to an order to become abandoned carts.

(Outside of the country, balk at paying shipping as trained by Amazon, etc.)\n\nI started CM because I love crypto in general and wanted to provide a way for people to find utility for their crypto and to \"cash out\" (as they mentioned on BU, which I started listening to almost a year after starting the site). I accept a lot of \"popular\" coins, some of which have generated 0 orders.\n\nI do not own Monero today (10 months ago the only option was the dumpster fire CLI wallet which I gave up on after about 3 minutes). I do not run any Monero software. I do not have programming knowledge to contribute on Stack Exchange.

They now do. I didn't see anybody post about that. I added Monero, and I figured some people may like that they have something to spend their Monero on. That's the service I provide and I hope I do a good job at that.\n\nIf you see a product on the website that tickles your interest, order. If you don't, don't. Either is fine.

Doesn't take much to set up a website on Shopify, after all!\n\nBut there are a lot of downsides, too. First off, because it's so easy to get into it, there is a **lot** of competition. There may be hundreds of other stores selling the exact same products as you... so how will you differentiate yourself?\n\nSecond, the margins are really small. Because of that, it's really hard to find profitable ways to advertise. Google AdWords is almost always too expensive these days to be profitable for drop shippers. Facebook is an option, but only for some categories. SEO takes a LONG time and requires a lot of work writing unique content, getting links, doing PR, etc.\n\nLastly, with the rise of Amazon which sells many products for about what you would be able to buy them from a drop-shipper, will you even be able to compete on price? \n\nI firmly believe the dropshipping business model can still work, but only if you specialize in a niche and become a go-to authority in that niche. Have better descriptions, better product photos, product videos, how-tos, help, etc. Provide so much information that Amazon just wouldn't even bother going that far, and you can compete. \n\nBut with the slim margins, it's almost not worth it... you'd be better off just buying wholesale and getting better margins and warehousing/shipping yourself or use a 3PL to ship for you. it costs more, sure, but the margins are SOOOO much better. \n\nBTW, I have owned an e-commerce company for 16+ years and have done dropshipping before, but in my main business we warehouse and ship.

{"body": "Haha....Not really.  Ebay has always been a pain.  So you are importing items and creating pages on Amazon?  I assume these are private label?  For Ebay, I use some trams in India to pull my info from Amazon listings and push that info to Ebay or Shopify.  There are also apps that do this.\n\nTo optimize your listings and get them moving:\n\nThe titles on Ebay should be a bit more keword spammy than Amazon.  The title and item specifics are important.  The item specifics hit on keywords the exact same way as the title so fill those in and make your own to expand keywords.  When you list, tank the price of the item.  Run an auction every day for a week (make sure the titles do not match exact or ebay may supress).  Put the link for your fixed price listing in those.  \n\nEbay Ad platform kind of sucks as of now so I don't have any advice there.\n\nRanking up on Ebay - Your goal is to rank to the very top for the most generic keyword possible.  Search \"Shoe Rack\" on Ebay and look at the 50 pair plastic ones.  The most generic keyword here is obviously \"Shoe Rack\".  Don't kid yourself and search \"50 pair plastic shoe rack\" and be happy if you are number one.  Get familiar with the other sellers selling this.  How big are they?  What price do you think they paid?  How many orders are they doing a day?  Do they have discounted shipping rates?  Are they on Ebay Deals?  For this item your competitors are coversheild, focusepart, luckystore258, gamegeear11, pacificdealusa and goldseed128.  For each of these sellers, notate their ebay template and location.  Some notes about each:\n\nCoversheild - Huge company.  Sends over 3K orders per day.\n\nfocusepart - Out of Compton, Ca.  They have a shitty description and send at least 200-300 orders a day on this account.\n\nluckystore258 - I personally hat this seller but that is beside the point.  Once again, look at their location and description.  Look at their template closely.  Look at the fact their seller name is 2 words combined followed by 3 digits.  This seller is HUGE.  If you search their top 5-10 items you will notice the same 20-30 sellers selling them.  These guys have at least 25 Ebay accounts and most of them sell the same items.  Of course it is agains't Ebay's policy but Ebay is not strict so it works.  This means you could wake up one day with 25 more competitors clogging the results.\n\ngamegear11 - Looks like this account is linked to focusepart and also pacificdealusa.  Or all 3 accounts just so happen to sell shoe racks, money counters, and hand cufffs while using the same images.\n\nPacificdealusa - See above\n\ngoldseeed128 - This account is linked to luckystore258.\n\nSo if we recap, you want to sell a shoe rack and you have 3 HUGE competitors on multiple accounts.  Obviously all these accounts have discounted shipping so can you compete?  On top of that Coversheild is on Ebay Deals all the time so they can rank up easier than you.  Also with the shitty written descriptions and titles on the other accounts combined with the location outside of LA we can assume these accounts are Chinese owned.  This means they most likely have cheaper pricing than you.  It also means they will work with MUCH smaller margins than you.  Now let's say you're crazy as shit and want to sell this crappy item on Ebay and compete with the big guys who are on Ebay Deals, work with log margins, run multiple accounts, and have shipping discounts you can't get... Click the sales history on the top item and you see they have sold 100 units in 9 days or about 11.1 units per day at 21.95.  Check the other guys ranked further down with prices ranging between 15 and 18 bucks.  Take Luckystore at 16.47.  He has sold about 66 units since Sept 28th at 16.47 but he has over 1,200 sold total.  That means this listing has been up for awhile - he is not trying to rank it up anymore by tanking the price.  If you want the number 1 spot, your price needs to be cheaper than 16.47 and you need to sell more than 11.1 units per day.  My goal on this item would be to price around 12.99 and get to 7 days straight of 15+ sales to rank to the top before I started raising the price about 1.00 every day until I got to my goal price of around 19.99 per unit.  I would search shoe rack every day and record my rank and check the market (maybe just 30 seconds per item).  If the market changes, I adjust to fight off the guys coming for my number one spot.  I didn't really mean to go on this long. lol.", "id": "d8taefj", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1476554066, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_57iov3", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1478625090, "author": "jordanwilson23", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t1_d8t8iv3"}

{"body": "Despu\u00e9s de una larga busqueda te puedo recomendar muy ampliamente SHOPIFY. Es un sitio originario de Canada pero dan servicio a nivel mundial y en espa\u00f1ol. Basicamente pagas una renta mensual de aprox $300 pesos mexicanos y a cambio recibes el hosting, pagina web personalizada y carrito de compras (muy importante). La ventaja es que es un sitio autoadministrable lo cual significa que tu mismo puedes agregar nuevos productos, fotos, descripciones y modificar precios y existencias cuando lo desees. Ojo el otro sitio popular de godaddy no esta tan padre porque no esta tan enfocado al comercio en linea (por lo de carrito de compras y procesamiento de pagos online). Es importante se\u00f1alar lo siguiente: si bien es cierto que entre sus beneficios SHOPIFY te regala cierto posicionamiento SEO es importante se\u00f1alar que la creacion del sitio web no garantiza el transito/generacion de ventas en el mismo. Para lo anterior es basico que contrates ADWORDS con google ya que desde un presupuesto limitado puedes establecer cuando deseas pagar por cada click que alguien haga en un anuncio online y que genere la visita a tu tienda en linea (aunque eso no garantiza la generacion de una venta para lo cual debes incentivar con envios gratis, descuentos y otras promociones). Lamentablemente puedo constatar que despues de varios a\u00f1os de experiencia en comercio en linea lo siguiente: el principal obstaculo al que se enfrentan los comercios es a la DESCONFIANZA de los posibles compradores a lo que pudiera ser un fraude. Lamentablemente los fraudes generados por otra gente afecta a los demas sitios en linea. Para eso puedes contratar una membresis con un sitio verificador aunque puede ser un poco caro pero vale la pena para darle credibilidad a tu sitio (recomiendo AMIPCI cuyo sello de confianza se puede ver en almacenes lideres a nivel nacional). Asi pues, ya sabiendo donde puedes crear la pagina lo las importante es un proceso previo: estudio de factibilidad el cual podra indicar aunque no al 100% si el negocio es factible o no tanto comercial como financieramente hablando (rentabilidad, supervivencia). Si la idea es buena compartela y pregunta a tu grupo cercano opiniones y sugerencias. Asi tendras idea si de entrada es buen proyecto o no. Finalmente no olvidar que el exito permanente solo es garantizado con una VENTAJA COMPETITIVA DURADERA la cual nos diferencia de la competencia y nos hace mejor opcion que ellos ante el consumidor final.", "id": "d8thirj", "subreddit": "mexico", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhv7", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1476564910, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_57mzow", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1478628540, "author": "HugoBoss90210", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t3_57mzow"}

Digital downloads are only a small portion of the products on my shop, but the app integrates wonderfully with the products, variants, and customer accounts (to access history and download links in the future! This was a big feature I was looking for).  A big downside for some is that the customer's download link can be shared with others if they're savvy enough to right-click their download link and \"copy link address\". The app has options to combat this by possibly limiting the number of downloads from a single link, or by tracking IPs that access each link and alerting you when it's fishy with the option to revoke access on the unique link. Personally I don't care if they're shared, they're just cheap PDFs and so far I haven't had any problems.\n\nI also made a new product template for my digital products, to better differentiate them from my physical products.

{"body": "I currently use shopify for my brand. I have the ~$40/month package. It was a bit of a jump from my ~$10/month Bigcartel page but worth it in the end. Bigcartel is a great place to start if you're unsure about the success of your brand as it's a cheap and easy solution. If you go the route of Bigcartel at least choose the first paid plan option as it gives you more products+more product pictures+ inventory tracking (if memory serves me correctly). \n\nWhen I finally made the switch to shopify I was amazed at how much the platform has to offer! First of all let me start by saying the customer support is amazing! I've had multiple questions for them and they always either find a way to help me right then and there or they take it up the ladder and get back to me in a timely manner. Support is always there to help you any time you need and the staff is super friendly! Also their analytics/reporting is a great tool to help improve your brand. Being able to see where your traffic comes from, you're most popular products,  and seeing daily/weekly/monthly sales and visitors is very helpful in managing and building your brand. For example, my store is closed currently awaiting a restock and I've had 800+ unique visitors to my site this month just checking to see if I'm open! The customization of your storefront is quite excellent and versatile as well. Being able to make a sleek store experience is what really sets it apart in my eyes. Plus every theme is responsive so it works on all devices! I had a few struggles with my store to get it how I wanted (because the theme I wanted to use didn't support some features and I had to code them in myself) but support was always a click away to help! Once I got it how I wanted I get complements on it all the time from my customers. Product management is also a breeze and the product pages can really help your items pop. Their new shopify mobile app is great for managing orders and products if you're on the move! Lastly there is also an App Store for shopify that allows you to add more functionality to your store making for endless possibilities! \n\n\nThe only\" issue\" I had with shopify is that I couldn't set up flat rate shipping for my products. But on the flip side it made me find out exact postage rates by weight and I find it just works better now. My orders fluctuate in total weight all the time so now postage is always fair. \n\nI recommend taking the time to link up a bank account with shopify as it removes the transaction fee for straight credit card payments. What happens is shopify wants you to use their payment gateway so they ding you per transaction for using it but you can bypass it by linking a bank account! That was a customer service tip and I'm glad I followed through! \n\nPersonally I swear by shopify now that I'm using it and I would recommend using it if you plan on taking your brand seriously and plan on investing in its future. Where as Bigcartel is a cheap and easy way to get your foot in the door if you're wary about success. I say spend the time and effort and build a memorable storefront experience and that should help bring customers back every time (provided you have the quality product to back it up)!\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any questions and I'd be glad to help!

{"body": "&gt;Hey guys,\nJust a follow up from a my previous post about [distributors]---LINK---\nI've actually gotten a wholesaler now (Woohoo!)\nThey do offer an FTP site with comma delimited text files with their inventory (these are constantly updated to reflect changes in stock and products).  I've got several questions at this point.\n\nI'd personally start by downloading their inventory file and beginning to filter by inventory and shipfrom location. \n\n&gt;1) Should I post EVERY PRODUCT Available that I can to the website (automate through Shopify API) and hand curate several collections?\n\nI wouldn't. Start with the top % of products by inventory (highest inventory levels means good volume and churn usually). Another issue is getting a sale for the a slow moving item that inventory goes 10-0.  Canceling orders or indefinite ship times suck badly and ruin review ratings. Caution in which items to list until you gain experience. Then filter for inbound + distributor rep advice as you build relationships. \n\n&gt;2) Should I Create a database of the products and then figure out a smart way to post Handcurated collections of products?\n\nDownload their inventory, ideally with prices, upc, model, vendor, description, etc. But inventory matters most and make sure to explode the shipfrom columns. \n\nBegin by filtering different ways to understand the distributor's strengths. They may have  100k skus but it'll be the top 20% of their items that do the vast vast majority of their revenue. \n\n&gt;3) Are there easier ways to integrate stock and inventory with Shopify?\n\nDon't know. Never used shopify by distributor side they usually prefer XML. \nXML is usually pushed to you. FTP is pulled by you. \n\nAny distributor worth its salt should be able to allow you to download various file formats for you to mess with and test. The more you can do on inventory, pricing and shipping orders yourself is a good sign. But early transactions may require their  IT people to help integrate. \n\n&gt;4) Are there any essential apps for automating email invoices to the distributors? keeping inventory? \n\nLots of choices out there, others can probably speak to this better than me. \n\n&gt;5) I plan on selling Magazines for firearms- is there a way to restrict shipping to certain states if they order item xyz\n\nThat right there is a redflag. Although you aren't selling firearms banks and ecommerce platforms may consider you to be in that category. You should be very careful about this element as many states are making it more difficult to to transact this kind of business online as well as things like ecigs, strippers, Cannabis, bitcoin, etc. \n\n&gt;6) should I just switch the PayPal Pro now before shopify payment portal inevitably closes my payment portal (apparently knives count as weapons, but I'm not sure if magazines and such would count)?\n \nNo idea, but as with my answer to #5 you may need legal advice regarding classifications of business and potential liability. You already know about knives but magazines may also trigger such issues. You might even have challenges down the line because of the vendors you purchase from and their affiliations. \n\nPeople talk about gun laws but there is absolutely regulatory pressure that makes it a challenge to get anywhere near some of these industries without existing industry experience. \n\nYou may come to find out firearm accessories carry similar regulation to the firearms themselves.

I have schooling and experience with the equipment I would be selling so getting involved in that way wouldn't be too much of a problem.\n\nYou mentioned WordPress.

{"id": "d8vjc7i", "body": "I used to work at an Agency that specialized in Colleges and Universities.\n\nYou didn't say how large your site is but the two months is pretty standard. In this time we would also be researching your competitors and potential link targets and only start outreach after that 2 month period.\n\n&gt; They will be charging me \u00a32500 per month, so thats \u00a35,000 down the drain before i've even seen a lift in rankings.\n\nThis phrase is concerning for me for a couple of reasons.I don't think you've set proper expectations for SEO. \n\nYou are probably not going to see an immediate lift even if they started link-building from day one.\n\nYou also think you've done SEO already. Shopify out of the box is not \"hella google friendly\". I'm trying to move off damn platform for a couple of stores now because there are some custom content and other things we want to do that the site can't handle. There are a couple of hacks we had to do get it \"friendly enough\". You mentioned weight loss, you have to produce a lot of content to make headway in this area and this is one of the areas where Shopify stinks.\n\nYou've done all your meta descriptions yourself - This needs to be reviewed.\n\nYou also haven't mentioned mobile at all. Did you do a full mobile audit? Depending on your potential customer, this could be up to 50% of your overall traffic.\n\nI personally don't know if your company is good or not just trying to point out some potential things that they could be doing in the 2 months and why we never take a customers word for it when they say they've already \"done\" SEO. We always review again and almost always find something major that needs to be reviewed and fixed.\n\n**EDIT:** Some of the comments here are funny. Some of you have never worked on high stakes, high competition SEO campaigns.\n\nHere is an example of why the full audit needs to be done. We sometimes need to know the reasons some decisions were made. 4 years ago I was working on a campaign where the in-house  SEO already \"optimized\" the site but we still insisted on double-checking everything. The website had 2 sections - the first for undergraduate students called \"College Search\" and the 2nd for graduate students called \"Graduate Search\". This seems like a no brainer, both sections were named similarly and matched.\n\nThe problem was that at the time College Search was search 22,000 times a month in Google but Graduate Search was only 45. We simply renamed the entire section to Graduate Schools which was searched 4,500 times a month and we saw an immediate lift of almost 3x and once we re-did the content to match we saw an even larger lift.\n\nThis is just one example I remember. I wasn't trying to embarrass the in-house guy but his boss felt it was necessary to pay us a lot of money and he wasn't happy about it.

{"id": "d8vpayu", "body": "Couple of constructive criticisms from having a quick 2 minute look:\n\n-No refund policy.\n\n-No product categories/collections, e.g. Men/Women. \n\n-Assuming you are using Oberlo to import your products from Aliexpress, it can often import unnecessary/strange info into the product description.\n\n-Some of the copy on your homepage could be tweaked. 'We utilize slower, budget shipping options', doesn't really inspire confidence in the buyer. Maybe try something like 'In order to satisfy our customers across the world, we offer free worldwide shipping on every order - in some cases, delivery can take up to 3 weeks, but we think it's worth the wait!'. \n\n-Considering you're dropshipping and not actually stocking your own inventory, you're not offering that many products (I understand this is a work-in-progress). I would hold off on advertising until your site is more filled out. \n\nRegarding advertising and conversions; you're obviously aiming for quite a particular niche so make sure you get the targeting right - if you don't, your conversions will always be low and you'll be wasting money advertising to people who aren't interested, Facebook's advert manager is pretty good for this (I would focus on Instagram and Facebook for your campaign, turn off Facebook audience network as it generally seems like a waste of money). It's probably worth setting up an Instagram page so that your Instagram ads have profile to go with it - if you splash some cash on advertising it shouldn't take long to rack up some likes/followers on your posts, if there is a viable market for your product. Have a go with [this guide]---LINK--- if you're not sure on Facebook advertising.\n\nAlso, consider giving people extra incentives to try and improve conversions - x% off their first order, free low value product with every order, etc. Converting sales isn't easy, and it's even more frustrating when you start getting customers all the way to the checkout stage then bailing (Shopify has a pretty robust abandoned cart recovery though), but it's all relatively normal. \n\nGood luck!  \n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "shopify", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sn78", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1476712973, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_57vley", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1478667679, "author": "I_am_invincible", "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_57vley"}

(someone might be interested in using?) what are you plan for the future? because eventually, you will have to secure the domain and if the name is competitive your name could be taken away from you in the future and that sucks. \nSo if you are serious about your business, you might want to buy it to secure it for a year and it's anyway $8 a year so it's nothing crazy.\n\nThe best one is really opinionated but I usually recommend Bluehost to my clients but most of them do the job for small guys.\nI heard bad things about GoDaddy tho but it's just room gossips. \n\nAnyway I hope this helps you", "id": "d8x38xq", "subreddit": "startups", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh26", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1476792786, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_582uty", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1478693265, "author": "trip16661", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t3_582uty"}

Once they were ready to sell products the effort to launch was seamless and cost effective.\n\nThey would have paid roughly half the price ($15 / month) for a decent host anyway. Had they decided on a different platform and then migrate over to Shopify it would have cost thousands in both development and SEO optimisation. Compare this to the extra $180 they paid for hosting costs to Shopify you can see why starting with the right platform first was the wiser choice.\n\nIf you need a few months to build the website without paying Shopify I have a Partner account which gives you unlimited time to develop (i.e you don't need to pay $30 a month) and when you're ready you can instantly switch to a paid account.

{"body": "Really great question! In most cases, you will use the tax rate associated with your customer\u2019s location. So for customers located in Maryland, you will typically charge the Maryland sales tax rate associated with the address of the sale (often this is the ship-to address).\n\nFor sales made to customers in other states, you will also typically use the rates associated with the location of your customers. So if there is a customer in CA that buys 10 t-shirts, you will use CA rates. But you usually ONLY need to collect sales tax from customers in other states when you have nexus and meet the minimum threshold.\n\nNexus means you have done some sort of action that gives you the obligation to collect sales tax. These actions can include things like keeping inventory in a state, attending a tradeshow in a state, working with affiliates in a state, and more. Plus, most states have minimum thresholds, meaning they don\u2019t make you collect sales tax unless you\u2019ve sold over a certain dollar amount there. It\u2019s also important to remember that you need to register to collect sales and use tax in any state where you\u2019re going to be collecting and filing.\n\nI hope this helps \u2013 I can send you several easy to understand resources that give state rates and info if you need.

You can also use third party validation like SSL and payment processing seals, security seals, etc. to build trust. \n\nBut beyond the trust issue, why would I buy from you to begin with? You said you sell name brand products, what would keep me from just going and searching them out on Amazon and getting them in two days for a better price?

Nice to hear from you.\n\n&gt;  Like I haven't accomplished anything in life and watching others do there own daily procrastination like they where mindless robots wasting time. \n\nThis is very normal at 18. I still feel this way sometimes at 26. Even Da Vinci, one of the most prolific creators of all time, lamented that he wasted his days. Don't be harder on yourself than necessary.\n\n&gt; i  knew i wanted to be an entrepreneur hands down, just know had no idea how to start.\n\nStart with customers. You can forget everything else \u2013 you just need a representation of your idea (a prototype, a sketch, whatever), and you need someone to give you money for it. \n\n&gt;  I refuse to publish even one crappie product. \n\nThis can be both good and bad. It's good to have standards, but it's bad to be perfectionist \u2013 especially when you're starting out. I mean, have you seen the Apple I? It had exposed wiring and it was pretty ugly!\n\n&gt; mental mindset when you wake up\n\nI actually am not that great at this. I tend to wake up groggy and a little stressed about work and bills and all those things.\n\n&gt; Should i invest in someone to help build the website with me?\n\nMaybe, potentially.\n\n&gt; Anything about trademark,copyright or licences i should know about?\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about this. Avoid the obvious things like blatantly copying other people's work \u2013 copying big companies will get you sued, copying small guys will get you bad press. Just do your own thing and you should be fine \u2013 occasionally someone might reach out to you about something, but you can figure that out as you go.\n\n&gt; take out a loan\n\nI'd recommend against this until you're very, very sure about what you're doing. You need to be super clear that spending $1,000 will make you $2,000 before you take that loan.\n\n&gt; partner\n\nI think it's good to have a partner if you can find one, ideally someone who has skills that you don't, and wants the same things but thinks in a slightly different way. It's good to have someone to keep you focused and accountable.\n\n&gt; great understanding of shirt creation and adobe software. no knowledge of website building, marketing or shipping products.\n\nIf you can handle adobe software (I can't, lol), you can definitely handle website building and basic marketing/shipping stuff.

{"body": "Dominic Barton, the man tasked with drawing the blueprint for Canada's economic future, and a council of advisers have come up with a plan to lift the country's faltering growth prospects: Increase immigration targets by 50 per cent to 450,000 people a year, create a new department to increase foreign direct investment and build a national arm's-length infrastructure bank A group of external advisers to Finance Minister Bill Morneau will call on the government this week to dramatically increase the level of immigration and foreign investment coming in to Canada to stimulate a sluggish economy in future years.\n\nTheir recommendations include increasing immigration by 50 per cent to 450,000 people annually over five years while easing the process for highskilled and entrepreneurial foreigners to come here; building a new department to entice foreign direct investment into Canada; and creating an arm's-length infrastructure bank.\n\nThe recommendations were confirmed by several senior sources who spoke with The Globe and Mail.\n\nThe infrastructure bank, seeded by federal money, would co-ordinate the building of large-scale projects such as electrical grids, highways, ports and transit systems, with a goal of tapping $4 from private financiers for every $1 from Ottawa, sources said.\n\nThe 14-member Advisory Council on Economic Growth, chaired by Dominic Barton, global managing director of the consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co., will deliver its first three recommendations to Mr. Morneau in Ottawa on Thursday. The council, which includes venture capitalists, institutional investors, business executives and academics, plans to present up to 20 ideas in the coming months intended to help Canada boost economic growth beyond forecast levels of less than 2 per cent annually through 2030.\n\nThe minister is expected to announce plans to act on at least one of the recommendations in his fall fiscal update, sources said.\n\n\"My sense is [the government is] keen to receive these recommendations as soon as possible,\" said one source close to the council.\n\n\"That probably tells you they want to do something.\"\n\nIn a speech to a Public Policy Forum summit in Ottawa last week, Mr. Barton said \"We're going to come up with aCa bold ideas that will actually jolt the system and get implemented.\"\n\nExpanding and improving the immigration process would address a key concern raised by fast-growing Canadian tech companies.\n\nMany say visa approval times for foreigners with high-level executive experience or in-demand skills can drag on for up to a year, and that coveted recruits who would otherwise move to Canada are not willing to put their lives on hold for so long when they have multiple opportunities. As a result, many tech firms say they have either lost out on key hires, or been forced to have such people work for them outside Canada.\n\n\"The current immigration process is overwhelmingly convoluted - even Kafkaesque,\" said Tobi Lutke, CEO of Ottawa-based retail software firm Shopify, Inc., which is hiring hundreds of people this year and has lost recruits because of immigration delays.\n\n\"The people we need to bring to Canada are not building widgets that Canadians otherwise would. The people we are recruiting aCa are the teachers that help us scale [up]. If we want to build the best companies in the world here, we need to allow the best people in the world to move here.\"\n\nSuch thinking has guided panel members, who believe that increasing immigration and making it easier for skilled foreigners to move to Canada can increase the pool of people with the training, ambition and drive to create substantial economic value and help support Canada's aging population. For example, a recent study by the National Foundation for American Policy said more than half of Silicon Valley startups valued at $1-billion (U.S.) or more were founded by immigrants.\n\nThe panel is calling for employers in technology and other expanding sectors to be exempt from the time-consuming process of proving no Canadian could do a job they want to offer to foreigners for senior positions or specialized roles, such as data science or digital marketing. Foreign students who have studied in Canada should have an easier time immigrating, the council also believes.\n\nIn addition, the council will recommend in the coming months the creation of a national body to help Canadians develop their skills and training for more technical jobs of the future.\n\nCouncil members are pressing Ottawa to create a department charged with increasing the level of foreign direct investment in Canada, which has expanded by just 2 per cent annually since 2005, well below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 7 per cent. Canada is seen as a relatively difficult place for foreign firms to invest, while fewer than 20 of Canada's trade commissioners are devoted full time to seeking out foreign investment. Several U.S. states, and countries including Ireland and Mexico, have hundreds of employees dedicated to that task.\n\nSources say the new agency would have 60 to 70 employees - not bureaucrats from other departments but people with relevant experience. They would promote Canada as an investment destination and serve as a \"one-stop\" source of information and links for foreign investors to local talent, universities, local-industry players and supply-chain networks. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's mandate letter to Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland last fall called on her to create an \"Invest in Canada Office.\"\n\nThe council's call for an infrastructure bank likewise echoes a Liberal election promise to provide low-cost financing to municipalities for infrastructure projects. However, the council and Mr. Morneau are now looking at a more ambitious plan in which the bank would gather and prioritize large projects that could earn revenue, such as electrical networks, and that attract billions in added international investment.\n\nCouncil members Mr. Barton and Michael Sabia sketched out the infrastructure bank idea at the Public Policy Forum summit last week. \"The idea of having some sort of central agency that can help us deal with those things with institutional investors makes eminent sense,\" Mr. Morneau said at the same event.\n\nThe council and government officials are anticipating some resistance to the recommendations.\n\nImmigration Minister John McCallum and Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains say they support more immigration, but acknowledge facing some opposition from within the government. Several recent polls - including one conducted for Mr. McCallum's department - found little support for increased immigration.\n\nMr. McCallum said in an interview on Tuesday that he is not prepared to go as high as 450,000. But he suggested the number will rise from current levels of 300,000 when the government releases its 2017 immigration targets by Nov. 1.\n\n\"This is a somewhat controversial issue, especially when you talk about numbers that high,\" he said. The minister said no final decisions have been made.\n\nAttracting investors to infrastructure will involve some degree of privatization - either for new projects or selling federally owned assets. A recent Public Policy Forum report said airports, water and waste-water infrastructure are the likeliest candidates.\n\nHowever, public-private partnership projects have drawn criticism in Canada and abroad, while political meddling has created the kind of uncertainty international investors do not like to see, including efforts by the Ontario Liberals to change the terms of the privatization of Highway 407 set by the previous government.\n\nThe council recommendations are not binding, but panel members have worked closely with ministers and bureaucrats since the group's launch in March.\n\nCOUNCIL MEMBERS\n\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau's Economic Advisory Council on Economic Growth:\n\nDominic Barton (chair), global managing director of consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co.\n\nElyse Allan, president and CEO of GE Canada\n\nKatherine Barr, venture capitalist with Mohr Davidow Ventures\n\nJennifer Blanke, chief economist, World Economic Forum\n\nKenneth Courtis, chairman, Starfort Investment Holdings\n\nBrian Ferguson, president and CEO, Cenovus Energy Inc.\n\nSuzanne Fortier, principal and vice-chancellor, McGill University 6 Carol Anne Hilton, CEO, Transformation\n\nCarol Lee, CEO, co-founder of Linacare Cosmotherapy Inc.\n\nChristopher Ragan, associate professor of economics at McGill University\n\nMichael Sabia, CEO of the Caisse de dApA't et placement du QuAbec pension fund 6 Angela Strange, partner, Andreessen Horowitz\n\nIlse Treurnicht, CEO, MaRS Discovery District\n\nMark Wiseman, senior managing director of BlackRock Inc.", "id": "d8yu36o", "subreddit": "canada", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1476891145, "author_flair_text": "Canada", "link_id": "t3_58ap2y", "author_flair_css_class": "CAN", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1478723766, "author": "rugboy86", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t3_58ap2y"}

It's embarrassing how little work I have done on it for the length it's been open, but the whole point was to \"do something\" and mostly practice website building, content creating, and affiliate ad posting.  My expectations from beginning until now are set as low as they can be.\n\nThe past two weeks I coordinated posts on Imgur, followed by reddit, both of which including a source link or URL to my site.  Here is some data.\n\nPost Number| Imgur Landing Views| Imgur Gallery Views| Reddit Score| Unique Visits to My Site\n---|---|----|----|----\n#1| 105,000| 45,000| 236| 2,150\n#2| 1,3000,000| 130,000 | 5,100| 6,000\n\nI know 1.3 Million views doesn't mean 1.3 Million people, but I'm still proud of it!  How do I better monetize that?  Being an alternate account drove the traffic from Reddit, I'm reluctant to include the URL in this comment.\n\nMy vision moving forward is I brand the site by upgrading the logo from it's current Squarespace stock.  After that I want to add a non-invasive, yet inviting subscription opt in.  Continue creating content and driving traffic while changing and improving affiliate ads.  A store page where I sell branded merchandise following most popular kitchen/cooking related items on Amazon.  Build a brand, establish a revenue stream, sell out if the money's right.\n\nMy questions are numerous, but here are the most important:\n\n1) Is branding a food site possible or even worth it?  99Designs is where I'm most likely going, but just wanted some feedback on whether or not to pursue.\n\n2) Given I want to open a storefront, is Squarespace good enough of would a shift to Shopify or other host be better?\n\n3) With 2 items purchased and shipped with Amazon Affiliate ads, is a storefront doable?  I feel I can include products in my content, link to them, maybe go as far as Fulfillment by Amazon, but I'm just unsure if that has ever been done or if it can be done?\n\nThanks to whoever is looking at this.

{"body": "Canada's tech industry is pretty good these days.  Several cities have good job markets for programming.  However, I'd recommend diversifying your programming knowledge a bit to help you in the long run, languages such as Python, Perl, Java, Ruby, C# are all higher demand languages and can definitely help round out your portfolio.  Also web development strategies such as AJAX can be quite useful.\n\nWith that being said, even though the tech industry is pretty good, there are a good number of graduates coming out of local programs.  So you need to establish yourself with a portfolio to get noticed.  If you're not doing this already, you need to be.  Several programming friends I have (I went to school for Computer Science myself, but since switched into traditional IT), have landed major careers at awesome places because of their portfolio.  The fact that it shows that you're into programming for more than just a 9-5 is a huge bonus.\n\nWith your web dev background, probably one of the best places you can look at in Canada would be a company called Shopify.  They are usually hiring several web programmers on a regular basis and have expanded hugely in the last 5 years, with no end in site.\n\nAs far as locations go for programming jobs, your best bets are (in order) Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Ottawa.  Other cities like Edmonton, Waterloo, and Calgary also might be decent choices, but will not have the volume that the first 4 have.\n\nSpecifically with Montreal, being in the province of Quebec, you would be doing yourself a great favour if you had at least a passing familiarity with French.  Now, that being said, a lot of employers in Montreal are quite content to hire english only candidiates if they meet their criteria.  Montreal is a fluently bilingual city, probably the 2nd most bilingual city in all of Canada.\n\nA lot of the jobs you will find in the city of Ottawa will want you also to be bilingual (probably 30-50% require some level of bilingualism, and another 30% will favour candidates that have that), so also keep that in mind.\n\nFor the process of becoming employed with a Canadian company as a foreign citizen, unfortunately I am of no help to you there.\n\n**TL;DR** Portfolio!

I know how the backdoors for Shopify and Adidas have worked in the past (involves knowing the item ID ahead of time and then repeatedly running the \"add to cart\" script with that ID at drop time until item is in the cart.)\n\nThe majority of Supreme bots are simple JavaScript page refreshers as Chrome extensions. Really doesn't work much differently from an extension like AdBlock. It all is client side, meaning it's just normal HTTP requests to Supremes hosting servers. Too many refreshes can get your IP banned yes, but it's not effectively different from you just spamming the refresh button manually. \n\nThe lag, I believe, comes from the instantaneous web traffic right at 11:00. All at once the server is getting mashed with hundreds of thousands of requests. Maybe you could think of this as being DDOSed for a second. But DDOS is malicious and doesn't really serve a purpose other than killing the site-for everyone.

The people racking up all the vans and peach champion shit have internet speeds in the 1000mbps range AND a bot. Their HTTP requests reach Supremes server the quickest and they can load the page content the quickest. \n\nIf Supreme wanted to kill bots, all they'd need is some traffic control protection (like CloudFlare) and a more in depth checkout page (like adding a ReCAPTCHA). However, adding those controls means people could have advantages over the other.

Shopify is completely managed, apart from the website theme itself which you can buy/design yourself - it's a bit more user friendly and their default theme is actually okay, and ranks fairly well in SEO.\n\nMagento is a good platform, but you need to have a bit of knowledge to keep it running efficiently, and securely. Digital ocean is good as they allow full control of the server OS/location/OS Settings, but if you have no previous server admin experience it can get messy quickly - so do research beforehand and be honest about your capabilities (something that I have gone against, and added lots of time to previous projects for no reason).\n\nMy current setup is on a Digital Ocean $10/M server located in the UK, using Cloudflare as my DNS provider and I will be implementing MaxCDN ($9/M).

{"body": "My first step is to read the Quarterly. Looking at their 6-K and doing a quick search for Shopify Plus\n&gt; In the six months ended June 30, 2016 , subscription solutions revenues accounted for 51.7% of our total revenues ( 58.1% in the six months ended June 30, 2015\n&gt; ). We offer a range of plans that increase in price depending on additional features and economic considerations. We also offer Shopify Plus, which caters to merchants with higher-volume sales and offers additional functionality, scalability and support requirements. Nestle, Boeing, Budweiser, Kanye and Redbull are among the more than 1,000 Shopify Plus merchants seeking a reliable, cost-effective and scalable commerce solution. The flexibility of our pricing plans is designed to help our merchants grow in a cost-effective manner and to provide more advanced features and support as their business needs evolve.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Our business model is driven by our ability to attract new merchants, retain existing merchants and increase sales to both new and existing merchants. The total number of merchants using our platform grew from more than 243,000 as of December 31, 2015 to more than 300,000 as of June 30, 2016 . As at June 30, 2016 , our merchants were disbursed as follows: United States of America, 59%; United Kingdom, 10%; Canada, 7%; Australia, 7%; and the Rest of the World, which represents approximately 150 countries, 17%. Our merchants represent a wide array of retail verticals and business sizes and no single merchant has ever represented more than five percent of our total revenues in a single reporting period. We believe that our future success is dependent on many factors, including our ability to expand our merchant base, retain merchants as they grow their businesses on our platform, offer more sales channels that can connect to the platform, develop new solutions to extend the functionality of our platform, enhance our ecosystem and partner programs, provide a high level of merchant service and support, and hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel. As of June 30, 2016 , Shopify had more than 1,500 employees and consultants.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nmacro economic slowdown and consumer weakness could really hurt shopify's transaction volume. But customers pay a monthly fee, they have also built their ecommerce empire on the platform which would prove costly for any business to migrate away from. So even if transaction volume slows down, businesses will still be paying rather than trying to migrate away to a home brewed solution which would prove costlier in the long run.\n\n\n150,000 Stores Now Use Shopify\n[---LINK---\n", "id": "d914adm", "subreddit": "RobinHood", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2uud8", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1477010730, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_57jffk", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1478763655, "author": "jimbeam145", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t1_d9134fk"}

{"body": "Please don't insult me. There isn't any fear mongering here, just someone who builds software services for a living. I'm telling you because I've built systems LIKE woocommerce/shopify for private businesses. You as the consumer see a price without really seeing the amount of work involved in building the technology. Does it work? Sure. But like I said if WP gets an update, Woocommerce may stop working OR even worse, continues to work with security issues. Ask yourself, do you want floating plywood with an engine attached or an actual boat? WP is a blogging platform with an ecommerce plugin. Shopify is an eCommerce solution.  \n\nWooCommerce IS a separate service. WordPress IS a separate service. You're able to join the two. There's no shady business practice I can see. What I see as a developer and business owner is someone who doesn't see the value in software. You're the type of client who can't understand why I could charge $150 p/h for development because you don't actually know the level of work involved in building something like Shopify. Those guys do some good work so please don't accuse a business of \"fear mongering\" or \"price gouging\".\n\nCongrats on figuring out the most basic hosting + WP + adding a plugin. That doesn't make you an expert and that certainly doesn't warrant \"Shopify is price gouging at $25 per month\". \n\n", "id": "d91qnfm", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1477058376, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_58mipb", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1478774499, "author": "ZIGGYBRO", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t1_d91pxjh"}

{"body": "Yes if you are new to e-commerce and want to go the absolute cheapest route then you can run youre e-commerce \"business\" off of a blogging platform. Thats fine. However I wish people would stop exaggerating what you are versus arent paying for, and what the definition of \"free\" is.\n\nOpting to run Woocommerce may save you money up front in hosting costs but tacks on loads of extra work to even make your store presentable and functional. You are required to:\n\n* Set up/optimize/maintain your server. What happens when your cheap-o hosting goes down and you dont notice? Hope they have quick and reliable service to reboot you.\n* Setup/optimize/maintain your Wordpress installation. Wordpress is constantly being attacked from all angles so I hope you stay up to date with all of your patches and plug-ins. Since you decided to host yourself you are responsible if customer information gets hacked. Did you accidentally white screen your shop installing a new plug-in? Hope you know enough PHP/server sleuthing to fix it before it affects your sales.\n* BUY an SSL cert, BUY any out of box plug-ins because Woocommerce doesnt come with much, BUY a actual decent looking theme because all of the default ones look like they were designed in 2003. \n\nThe list goes on. \n\nSo yes. If you have absolutely no money and your \"business\" cant handle a $25 a month payment you can use Woocommerce. Just understand you are trading $ costs for time and skill costs. I have been working in e-commerce for a long time and worked for companies running anything from X-cart to Magento Enterprise. You know what matters to me? That things work, the website is always up, and people are buying things. With Shopify I get all of that and never have to worry about anything. I spend my time running my business and fulfilling my orders. $25 (more for me because I pay for plug-ins) is a drop in the bucket. \n\n", "id": "d91qu9u", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1477058659, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_58mipb", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1478774590, "author": "blk_slp", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t3_58mipb"}

{"body": "Article:\nMajor DDoS attack on Dyn DNS knocks Spotify, Twitter, Github, Etsy, and more offline\nThe sound of silence.\nhacker fist\t\n\n1Comment\nBrad Chacos\nBrad Chacos | @BradChacos\nSenior Editor, PCWorld\n\n    Oct 21, 2016 6:30 AM\n\n    Update: Dyn says services were restored at 9:36 A.M. Eastern time, and I can now connect to the affected websites again\u2014which indicates the two events were indeed related. \n\nEvery morning, I sit down at my PC with a cup of coffee, crank some tunes on Spotify, and scour r/techsupportgore for gnarly PC disaster pics to tweet out. Not this morning, because it appears a massive Distributed Denial of Service attack targeting DNS host Dyn has knocked a big chunk of the Internet offline.\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) converts human-readable URLs (like \"pcworld.com\") to their underlying numeric IP addresses. Dyn hasn't confirmed that the outages and its DDoS attack are related, but it seems likely.\n\nHacker News users report the following sites are down:\n\n    Twitter\n    Etsy\n    Github\n    Soundcloud\n    Spotify\n    Heroku\n    Pagerduty\n    Shopify\n    Intercom\n\nTrying to connect to all of those sites indeed proved fruitless this morning. Zoho, SaneBox, and iHeart Radio also appear to be down on my end, in New Hampshire. Your mileage may vary, however, as Dyn says the connectivity issues are largely limited to the east coast. A DownDetector.com check of backbone Internet provider Level3 helps reveal the extent of the problem, as first reported by Gizmodo.\nlevel 3 down\n\nTwo hours ago, Dyn posted the following status report:\n\n    \u201cStarting at 11:10 UTC on October 21th-Friday 2016 we began monitoring and mitigating a DDoS attack against our Dyn Managed DNS infrastructure. Some customers may experience increased DNS query latency and delayed zone propagation during this time.\u201d\n\nThe company says its engineers are toiling to fix the issues. If the sound of silence is troubling you in the meantime, Twitch and YouTube are still working just fine.\n\n\n\n", "id": "d91xshz", "subreddit": "news", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1477067786, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_58o3yd", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1478777950, "author": "malakistiri", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t3_58o3yd"}

{"body": "Image: Getty\nTwitter, Spotify and Reddit, and a huge swath of other websites were down or screwed up this morning. This was happening as hackers unleashed a large distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on the servers of Dyn, a major DNS host. It\u2019s probably safe to assume that the two situations are related.\n\nUpdate 12:28 PM EST: Dyn says it is investigating yet another attack, causing the same massive outages experienced this morning. Based on emails from Gizmodo readers, this new wave of attacks seems to be affecting the West Coast of the United States and Europe. It\u2019s so far unclear how the two attacks are related, but the outages are very similar.\n\nIn order to understand how one DDoS attack could take out so many websites, you have to understand how Domain Name Servers (DNS) work. Basically, they act as the Internet\u2019s phone book and facilitate your request to go to a certain webpage and make sure you are taken to the right place. If the DNS provider that handles requests for Twitter is down, well, good luck getting to Twitter. Some websites are coming back for some users, but it doesn\u2019t look like the problem is fully resolved.\n\n \nToday's Brutal DDoS Attack Is the Beginning of a Bleak Future\n\nThis morning a ton of websites and services, including Spotify and Twitter, were unreachable\u2026\nRead more\nDyn posted this update on its website: \u201cStarting at 11:10 UTC on October 21th-Friday 2016 we began monitoring and mitigating a DDoS attack against our Dyn Managed DNS infrastructure. Some customers may experience increased DNS query latency and delayed zone propagation during this time. Updates will be posted as information becomes available.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a list of websites that readers have told us they are having trouble accessing:\n\n\nActBlue\n\nBasecamp\n\nBig cartel\n\nBox\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nCNN\n\nCleveland.com\n\nEtsy\n\nGithub\n\nGrubhub\n\nGuardian.co.uk\n\nHBO Now\n\nIheart.com (iHeartRadio)\n\nimgur\n\nIntercom\n\nIntercom.com\n\nOkta\n\nPayPal\n\nPeople.com\n\nPinterest\n\nPlaystation Network\n\nRecode\n\nReddit\n\nSpotify\n\nSquarespace Customer Sites\n\nStarbucks rewards/gift cards\n\nStorify.com\n\nThe Verge\n\nTwillo\n\nTwitter\n\nUrbandictionary.com (lol)\n\nWeebly\n\nWired.com\n\nWix Customer Sites\n\nYammer\n\nYelp\n\nZendesk.com\n\nZoho CRM\ufeff\n\nCredit Karma\n\nEventbrite\n\nNetflix\n\nNHL.com\n\nFox News\n\nDisqus\n\nShopify \n\nSoundcloud\n\nAtom.io\n\nAncersty.com\n\nConstantContact\n\nIndeed.com\n\nNew York Times\n\nWeather.com\n\nMashable\n\nWSJ.com\n\ntime.com\n\nxbox.com\n\ndailynews.com\n\nWikia \n\ndonorschoose.org\n\nWufoo.com\n\nGenonebiology.com\n\nBBC\n\nElder Scrolls Online\n\nEve Online\n\nPagerDuty\n\nKayak\n\nyouneedabudget.com\n\nSpeed Test\n\nFreshbooks\n\nBraintree\n\nBlue Host\n\nSBNation\n\nSalsify.com\n\nZillow.com\n\nnimbleschedule.com\n\n\nHere\u2019s an internet outage map from DownDetector as of 12:46 PM EST:\n\n \nHere\u2019s a gif that shows the internet outage at 9:00 AM EST versus 12:30 PM EST:\n\n \nAt the time of publication Dyn said that it was still dealing with the problem.\n\nWhat websites are down for you?

With 15-18 names from that list you could make a fairly solid growth and income mix.\n\nDisney\n-Yes, especially if it gets in the mid $80's.\n\nMcDonalds\n-I'm not that crazy about McDonalds from the standpoint of I just don't have a good enough reason/thesis as to \nwhy to invest,but I will say that I've been impressed with the remodeled stores that I've seen and the demand for a \ncheap meal will always be there.\n\nCoca Cola\n-I think the concern with Coke is that they will need to innovate and diversify. Soda drinking will never go away, but it is\non the decline and more and more places will start taxing sugary drinks like Mexico did.\n\nKraft Heinz\n-Fine.\n\nIMAX\n-I'm just not bullish on moviegoing at all.

Their new Starbucks Reserve stores are really quite nice.\n\nAlphabet\n-Certainly nothing wrong with Alphabet.\n\nAmazon\n-With AWS and a retail story that continues to push into new areas, Amazon just continues to be dominant. \nIt's certainly not cheap, but I actually think in many ways the story is actually building strength. \n\nFacebook\n-Don't care about social media in the slightest (hey, just being honest), but it's certainly a very well-run company.\n\nMicrosoft\n-Couldn't agree less with the LinkedIn purchase, but otherwise Nadella has been a quality replacement for Ballmer.\n\nNVIDIA\n-It's a great company and there are plenty (too many?) cheerleaders for it on here. The concern that I have is that it \nis overbought. While long-term it will probably do very well, the concern I have is that people are going to chase and then\nbe disappointed when they chase it right into a pullback.\n\nIBM\n-No thanks.

Target gyms in your area. Target Instagram users - listened to an episode of Shopify Masters podcast where a guy selling gym shorts was targeting Instagram hashtags of #deadlift etc and leaving comments. Targeted Facebook ads (don't pour money in though until you're seeing ROI!)\n\nMobile optimise - dunno about you but over 50% of my traffic is on mobile, and another small chunk on tablet. Things to fix:\nMenu is a tiny bit hidden \nPut social media icons in footer (you don't want people to leave your site!)\nThere is a MASSIVE chunk of text on homepage that I started reading and thought was going to be a cute story about how your supplements help you concentrate, but instead was a random story about something else. Pop this on a different page, and write the story about supplements. Did you write this yourself? If so, kudos, your copy is pretty engaging!\n\nGeneral\nHow much is shipping do you ship overseas how long does it take can I return it (this avoids people adding to cart just to check rates)\nTestimonials - the sponsorship thing reads like you're paying for testimonials which dramatically devalues the influence of them.\nCHECK YOUR COMPETITORS!

Well, not that we know of... we only subscribe to the basic Shopify plan so we don't see those analytics in our reports unless someone gets past the first part of our cart page (address, etc.) (we don't have enough sales to support upgrading! haha) We get random sales from facebook campaigns every once in a while... but those are embarrassingly infrequent. I have a facebook page related to fighting which has over 100k likes/followers. And an instagram following for the same IP with 15k followers. We use both for cross-promotion, but we see very little traffic from them (probably the sales mentioned above). We also have a couple other networks on facebook we can cross-promote to. We're the \"official supplement\" of a local fight show that is owned by a friend. \n\nWe *hate* those fake, contrived comments on instagram that are clearly automated, we get them *all. the. time.* I guess I can spend a few minutes a day to write actual comments on relevant hashtagged posts. \n\nWe just started running a few ads through AdWords, so hopefully we'll have some more data to work with as traffic increases. We're getting some decent click through on some of our keywords, still to early to tell what's working and what's not, though. \n\nLanding pages is something I'm having a hard time with using this theme... I've set up some html pages hosted through shopify's CDN to see what we can get through them... we've actually had a few sales from them. \n\nWe use Amazon Fulfillment, so we don't really focus too much on local promotion, other than that local fight show I mentioned, as all of our inventory is warehoused with Amazon. We don't have product on-hand to hand out or let people try - I know, I wish we could. For this same reason, we do not ship overseas as we do not have product in fulfillment centers overseas. \n\nI did write that article, thank you. I'm having trouble with the theme we're using - it's not that customizable. There aren't many options to display blog posts. I guess it's not important for them to be on the front page. I can remove them. I'll add shipping cost info and see how we can improve the testimonials. Both are good observations. \n\nThanks again! I really do appreciate it.

How many products? How many customers? What features do they need? A lot of programmers make the mistake of skipping over these solutions by not closely looking at the business needs. For example, a small shop with a few dozens products doesn't need a platform such as Magento if it's basic e-commerce they are after.", "id": "d95ju51", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1477316680, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5940g2", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 6, "retrieved_on": 1478841209, "author": "viper2002", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t1_d95ixkk"}

I am not an expert in this area (I am more tech startup-y) so I would recommend finding someone who has been successful at building blogs and reading their posts here on this subreddit and whatever else you can find on google.\n\nYou can advertise, but for a blog this is less than ideal because audiences to blogs are generally to read so you have an additional step to monetisation.\n\nIE a normal online shop just has the following: Convince audience to spend money. The audience wouldn't browse to a shop in the first place if they weren't already interested in potentially spending some money.\n\nA blog, on the other hand, is generally informational so it has an additional step to get revenue: Convince audience to read blog + Convince audience to spend money.\n\nThis ultimately is why I felt like a dropshipping storefront might be easier to handle. You can open a shopify account trial, stick stuff up there from aliexpress (or make your own t shirts or whatever) and be running in 24 hours using ads to promote your site and see how it goes. Whereas I don't think ads would convert well enough to get a positive return on your investment for a blog.

{"id": "d98a055", "body": "What you need to understand about UX is that it is problem solving in a human centric way in relation to technology, no about making things look pretty. Ultimately user centricity is at the heart of any design implementation you move forward with when you work in UX. You mentioned that you have experience in designing the \"look\" of digital products and a bit of html/css skills, but nowhere did you mention you had skills in user centered design methodologies. This is a redflag. I want to provide some constructive criticism so you understand why this is a redflag and then you can move forward and make the best decisions.\n\n**1** When you work in the field of user experience you need to know the principals of human centered design (e.g. appropriate research methodologies, latent need finding, usability testing, etc). The focus is on gaining empathy and finding pain points. You need to understand the process that goes into a design approach before jumping into visuals. Right now you need to learn the foundations of UX before putting anything 'UX' in you job title. \n\n**2** Many web designers and graphic designers are labelling themselves as UX professionals without actually having an understanding of what UX is. Having visual chops \u2260 UX. Many companies still don't understand what UX is but pepper the term into job titles when looking for visual design folks. Majority of seasoned UX professionals don't appreciate the term 'UX/UI' because they are two separate skillsets (like saying 'plumber/electrician'). Some of the best UX professionals I know have very little UI skills, if at all. I would suggest either focusing on UI skills or deepening your understanding of UX, rather than looking at a UX/UI title (but this is just my option) \n\n**3** Toronto isn't a good market to be an aspiring UX professional with no credentialed background. You have people coming out of programs from Waterloo, Sheridan College, UofT HCI, and Western, all formally educated and hungry. Although Toronto and surrounding areas have good tech companies where UX skills are in demand (e.g. Shopify, IBM, RIM, 500px, Facebook) these places usually recruit and hire people who have a very honed understanding of UX. When you couple this fact with the tendency that ageism is an issue in the tech sector it may be an uphill battle for you. \n", "subreddit": "userexperience", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qj2z", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1477473877, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_59c43p", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1478888773, "author": "dodd1331", "controversiality": 0, "parent_id": "t3_59c43p"}

{"body": "This is an appropriate reply, but just like you can lease a retail space in the real world, you can use a hosted cart solution online.\n\nShopify, 3D Cart, Big Commerce and many others all do a decent job of giving you a ready made store, but before you begin there are a few things to consider.\n\n1. If you had to describe your product line would you use words like small, uniform, consistent and light, or would you use words like awkward, heavy, lumpy, big, inconsistent and requires refrigeration?\n\nShipping is the holy grail of ecommerce. The right product line means a smaller number of stock boxes (and the warehouse space they consume), a consistent, easy pick pack and ship process, flying under the dimensional weight radar, etc. If you're already shipping, you know this, but it's important for anyone considering making the jump.\n\n2. You'll need a second merchant account for credit card processing because your current account will charge you out the butt for \"card not present\" transactions.

I knew this going in. \n\nNo sales prior, and no interest drummed up for my specific company. I just built the shop, opened it, and started grass rooting the thing on Facebook. And now Google shopping add drive a ton of the traffic. \n\nMy stack is Shopify. So orders and tracking and all that is handled all by them. I am a web developer and had built sites for folks on Shopify previously, so it made it easy to dive right and go. Site was up in a few hours, granted it now looks nothing like it did then as I've changed everything on the theme I used. Once I get an order, I take the product number and address and just send it to my distributor and they ship the item via a USPS flat rate box for $6.80 and send me tracking. I take the tracking and throw it in shopify. That's the most manual part I gave to do, and I'm working on figuring out how to automate that. \n\nAs for deciding what to sell, that kind of just came where my niche was born. The market I'm in is already huge and flooded, I just wanted to make a cleaner, easier to use place to purchase the products. I'm also actively involved in the community surrounding my market, so for a few years I've been able to watch it and see what's what and how things go down on the community level. So I guess you could call that my market research. :) \n\nInitial investment? My time. I paid up front for the month of Shopify, and then built the site while working on securing distributlrs that would work with me. Given that I drop ship and they're in the USA, that process was fairly quick. My whole goal with this was to learn as I went and that if I made mistakes I knew it wouldn't be at the loss of mine, or someone else's money. I work full time and have a second part time job outside of this hustle, so I needed something that if it didn't do well for a few months wasn't bleeding me money. We canceled cable to cover the cost of Shopify and a couple other monthly charges(such as a dummy mailing address) and that was the  investment I guess. I did that not because we were hurting for the $29 a month it would take for Shopify, but rather just as a reason to say welp, I made a sacrifice for this and can't watch the reruns of House that I normally would, so I might as well take a stab at it and work on the site. \n\nDefinitely let me know if you any follow up questions to those answers! I love those kinds of questions, because it allows me to sit back and think about how I got here, and reflect on what worked and what didn't.

ANYONE can source shit from china, open up their own website on Shopify, then simultaneously sell their products on Amazon.

All these brands like $UA getting assblasted... a part of that is their sales going somewhere, but where?  These little dudes who can spend $2k to $10k, barely any of which on actual overhead, send the cheaply branded product from China/Alibaba directly to Amazon fulfillment centers, and onward to the customer without any bullshit like rent &amp; employees.\n\nGoing back to Amazon Affiliates.  If you run a website or app you can be an Amazon Affiliate to monetize your site.  \"Fees\" are collected when the affiliate sells a single product, which are naturally much lower than a \"bounty\" like getting someone to sign up for Amazon Prime.  Hardly two weeks ago Amazon upped their Fee percentage from 3% to 10%.  What does this mean?  Bloggers, app developers, content sluts, have been tossed a significant incentive boost to shove ads down the throats of people who visit their site and use their apps.\n\nOn top of that, it has been announced they are hiring significantly more seasonal employees.\n\nA strong dollar that gets dick at the bank and volatility in the market might be better spent on stupid shit at Amazon.  Who here hasn't gotten shitfaced and then a few days later get a package you don't remember ordering?\n\nAll of this information heading into an earnings in which the forecast will be including 2016 Holiday Season.  \n\nNow if some dickhead with the username SasquatchCunt knows all of this shit, good chance people buying and selling the stock and options today know it too.  Is it all priced in?  EPS and Revenue beats could take a backseat to average or worse than expected guidance.

{"body": "Yeah, I've used Bigcartel before. It's nice and simple, works good. I personally like Shopify much better though. They are certainly the leader in the space.\n\nReasons why I like Shopify better:\n- Great customer support\n- Tons of apps to connect to your store to do almost anything you can think of (build an email list, set up a referral program, add features)\n- More themes\n- More integrations with other important service providers, Mailchimp, Paypal, Google and tons of others.\n\nThe most important thing is that you get something up that you can understand and control. Shopify at times can be a bit more complicated, so if starting on Bigcartel is easier, then I say go for it. Number one thing is to not get bogged down.

Then again, you're 20 years younger and on the other side of the world than I.  What do I know?\n\nIf there's really that much demand for them, and you can fill it, then I say go for it. But not without thinking out the details.  \n\nSpecifically:\n\n* How sure are you there's such a demand for socks?\n* Why would customers purchase from you?  What makes *your* socks so special?\n\nPersonally, I think that if people are really that interested in buying socks, your best bet will be a subscription box type of service. [Cratejoy]---LINK--- or any number of competitors can help you with the subscription box.  You can easily complement that with an online store, too using [Shopify]---LINK--- \n\nThe reason I suggest a subscription box is because every month (or whatever) your customers can get some cool new socks that everyone will be jealous of.  The primary reason is that you'll get **recurring revenue** each month rather than having to rely on just individual sales.\n\nThe biggest hurdle I see:  How are you going to convince parents or grandparents to buy this for their kids or grandkids?  \n\nTeens (at least in America) generally don't get ATM cards until they're at least 16.  Probably at a later age for many of them.  They will likely not have credit cards of their own to sign up for a subscription box.\n\nAs for sourcing:  Usually recommended here is [Alibaba]---LINK---  I have personally never used them, so I cannot speak to the quality of services they offer.  From what I've read in other posts, you select vendors to work with, have sample products made (for a fee I believe) and then you approve them  or request changes before placing your order (or not).\n\nBest of luck!", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1477864780, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5a8a0w", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1478997060, "author": "JasonAtSBWP", "edited": false, "parent_id": "t3_5a8a0w"}

{"id": "d9f8jpo", "body": "First and foremost, make sure you have a quality product.  Your top concern before you do anything should be Safety, Quality, and Customer service.\n\nI would promote in a passive way and get people excited about what you do.  Show yourself making/building your items on social media like Facebook and Instagram. Folks like seeing real people doing real things.  Be sure to post personal pics every once in awhile.  Folks loving seeing pics of your dog or cat.  I know you mentioned Facebook but get a business FB page.  \n\nFor the love of all that is holy, do not market to friends and family through Facebook.  It's fun to show what you do but folks who know you DO NOT like to be spammed.  \n\nOn twitter and Instagram use hash tags to reach people who are interested in the categories you are targeting.   Post beautiful images of the products at least twice a day.  Be sure to interact with those that comment.  You want to build a following of folks who are interested in what you do and love what you make. Find out what gives you the best response and the best time to post. You can also pin these to Pintrest.  Also post instructional videos to places like YouTube. \n\nJoin Facebook groups in your niche and create relationships with people.  See what folks are doing and what they are looking for and what you could do better.  This is a direct line to get advice from people who could be using your product, so you can ask them questions like \"Hey what do you think makes a good widget?\" You can also collaborate with people you form bonds with, who make make other types of things that could go with you project, creating packets of things. Be sure to give back and participate in these communities.  Making the items is only 20% of the work.  Finding people to buy them, marketing, and building a following is the other 80%.\n\nHave all of these social media sites connected to a website as a home base.  Also as you grow diversify yourself.  It's never good to have all you eggs in one basket.  For me I make at least half my earnings away from Etsy by doing custom orders and selling through other online stores who agreed to carry my niche product.\n\nAlso have nice images posted to show your product, practice with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to have your items found online.  There are some great sites, and instructional posts that help with this connected with Shopify and Etsy.  Spend time both reading and doing so you learn what works and what will not.  Try to learn from your mistakes and always be transparent with you customers and consumers if you run into issues. This can be super hard at times and you may loose a few dollars because you had to correct some problem that you had no control over.  But it is much harder and cost more time and money to gain new customers then keeping the old.  \n\nHope these ideas helped in some way. \n\nEdit: Grammar and Spelling", "subreddit": "Etsy", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq24", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1477917933, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5abdlm", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1479009997, "author": "Pyrometer2232", "edited": 1477918254, "parent_id": "t3_5abdlm"}

{"body": "Agree with this.  An ecommerce site, no matter what you sell, does not run itself, market itself, or do anything without your hard work, research, dedication, and (again) *hard work*.  Everyone seems to think \"get a dropshipper, build site with shopify template, launch site, make some facebook and twitter posts = sit back and watch the cash flow in\".  This is so far from reality.  You have to research - *really research* how to be seen.  The name of the game is visibility, which means SEO.  Yes, your site has to be good, selection good, prices good, and support good, but if you are not seen then you can't sell. \n\nMost everyone who is selling big has a great site that works, but it isn't the site that is doing the really hard work - that has to be you.  Research your market, your niche, your selling opportunities, etc.  Most of this can be done with time more than money, so dedicate as much as you can.  Hope this helps.
