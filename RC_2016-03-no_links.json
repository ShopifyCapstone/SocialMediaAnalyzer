After solving one issue, I've been using it in production since without any issues :) Feel free to ask me any other specific questions, otherwise here's a few answer's to the questions you have:\n\nI've got table's with hundreds of thousands of records and haven't run into any speed issues with queries. Adding a composite key on the tenant_id and primary key is helpful though.\n\nYou bring up an interesting point with having different database per client. For simplicity, if all clients have the same codebase, have one database with many tenants. \n\nHaving multiple databases adds a lot of management overhead, and complications when it comes to migrations and ensuring data constancy. \n\nThe only reason I believe you should go with multiple databases from the start is if you know that right from the beginning some clients will have extremely high workloads, and some that use next to nothing. \n\n\nJust remember, premature optimisation is the root of all evil. To start with, I'd say run with 1 database, that package and ensure every table has a tenant_id. You can then shard your databases later if need be.

Also, how deeply you want to modify the visual look and whether you will need any advanced features/ functionality that isn't provided OOB.\n\nPersonally I'd avoid Opencart - I've used it since v1.5 but there has been a LOT of bad feeling within the community and the development seems to have lost its way somewhat. Daniel the CEO has a bad attitude IMO and this wasn't helped with him nearly selling out his open sourced community work to Amazon and Ebay...\n\nPrestashop is good for a medium sized store but they are blatantly trying to support partner modules and often if you want a feature that is not already supported OOB or by a cheap/free module the alternatives may set you back quite a lot of expense. This platform is quite resource hungry if you want a snappy experience so you will want a VPS at least (basic hosting will not be enough).\n\nIf you just want to start out with a handful of products and are after a smooth polished UI experience without needing lots of advanced features I'd recommend Shopify or Woocommerce.\n\nThe final decision ought to include the % cuts that various platforms take (I believe Shopify is the most \u00a3\u00a3 by default?) because you NEED to factor in cuts from their business model. Obviously Prestashop or Opencart are free by themselves, but your payment provider (Paypal, Stripe etc) will take a cut. Shopify and other hosted platforms take a cut on top of the payment cut I believe.\n\nYou can demo all of the above CMS platforms on your own local installation using XAMPP or equivalent. I would start here and try out the front &amp; back-ends to see whether they include all the features you need OOB.\n\nEDIT: Finally you will need to factor in the cost of any further development, either in terms of cost from a hired developer, or your own time.

{"body": "The \"value\" of contract work is hard to lock down, as it really varies based on the needs and experience level of the contractor.\n\n- capable novices might charge as little $20-30/hour\n\n- professionals might charge more like $60-100/hour\n\n- experts might charge in excess of $200/hour (and might not even touch the code!)\n\nSo let's do some math :\n\n    $20/h * 20h/w * 8w = $3,200\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem like a great return for you.  Let's try doing this backwards :\n\n    $2500 / (20h/w * 8w) = $15.63/h\n\nOk, that's not bad change, but that's not exactly skilled labor wages.  Even if you think of it in terms of 8 weeks of guaranteed work, that's pretty light.  Not to mention you're going to pay estimated tax on that, so your takehome is going to be more like $10/h.

Now some of that is things like support, data entry, seo, etc.  But even if we cut that already-low estimate in half ($5k), that's still DOUBLE what they're offering.\n\n----\n\nMy advice : don't take the job unless you have no other options.  They're lowballing it by a good amount and if you both go into the relationship thinking everything sounds reasonable, you'll both leave angry.  \n\nIf you take the job, see what you can do to increase the budget, and chalk the rest of the \"missing\" money up to learning experience and portfolio filling.  But make it absolutely clear that you're offering a serious discount.

{"body": "Oh where to begin with this... Ok, I work for a Enterprise solutions company so I have a lot of exp in this area.\n\nThis sort of thing already exists, and is referred to as a PIM (Product Information Manager). Only a PIM does quite a bit more, in that not only does it track and maintain your inventory, it also masters your product database. For large companies that have stores all over the country (or world) a PIM does things like cataloging, Price books, things of that nature.  \n\nOk you're a small business, and most of people you're speaking to are as well. How none (or most) of you don't have an inventory tracking system baffles me. Do you have a POS? Because chances are you have an inventory tracker. And if you don't have a POS, then you need to invest in one, not this.  A solid POS for small businesses (with inventory tracking capabilities) can be extremely affordable these days, because inventory tracking isn't seen as any sort of \"advanced\" feature. It comes standard in most POS today.\n\nYou're typically only going to start finding separate Inventory solutions once you get into the Large Business arena, because at that point you need more robust solution than your POS or QB can't offer. \n\n\nAs for \"online Shop\" inventory solutions, if you're selling both in store and online your best bet is to get a POS that integrates to your ecommerce platform (and I'm talking about a platform like Magento, not Etsy).  There are plenty out there, like Shopify, that works great for small businesses.If you're mainly using something like Etsy chances are you can't afford (nor do you need) something that integrates.  \n\nIn the case that you do have a store front, but are selling on something like Etsy at the same time, I highly recommend into building, or having a real site built. It's not as terrible as it appears trust me.\n\nFinally, I know your heart is in a good place because you're only asking $5 a month, but ultimately I think at that rate you're destined to fail. At $5 a month per license, you can't build enough revenue to upkeep the solution, while implementing upgrades.

You ship stuff in from China, you resell it online. \n\nTo start, you can create a \"Fulfilled by Amazon\" account. Then, go to AliExpress and order sampler packages from some merchants. When you find something that isn't a fraud, you order a lot of it, then post your goods on Amazon. As it sells, you ship out the goods and try to keep everyone happy. \n\nThat is how a lot of people start. Eventually, you build relationships with your suppliers, and you might branch out from Amazon to sites like Ebay, Etsy, and shopify, or even make your own site from scratch.\n\nWhat I like about this system is there is a relatively low barrier to entry, and lots of intermediate steps to grow slowly.

Basic stuff at first -- HTML/CSS/jquery/wordpress.  Stuff that you can learn the basics of in a week, if you're motivated enough (and I was).  \n\nStarted learning each of those topics more in-depth.  \n\n-  Learned other variants of HTML (HAML/JADE)\n-  Learned the higher-end of CSS, and the variants of it (SASS/LESS/Bourbon)\n-  Learned as much as I could about proper Javascript, and then some of the more popular frameworks (mostly focused on React)\n\nDitched wordpress early on.  Saw there was more $$$ in ecommerce.  Started working a lot with WooCommerce, Magento, Shopify, BigCommerce, etc.\n\nSaw that there was more $$$ to be made with writing backend applications, so started learning about PHP more in-depth.

Something annoying to me is that your home page and catalogue page are the same exact page. I'd like either category to offer something different or just add extra features (functional 'extra' not just to take up space 'extra') like an IG feed, maybe add some replay features of some bizarre events in your gaming history that called for a 'GG', I dont know I personally find it annoying when I click through pages on a site and literally its like I just clicked refresh on one page multiple times...

Nothing wrong with it really but through my experiences those types of shirts are better sold in bull and sent to malls and shit. You know? Not something you include in a seasonal release or anything but its own standalone tee. This is really tedious and really doesn't mean anything but something to maybe consider when you launch a full collection.\n\nYour lookbook definitely looks stronger even though there are only two photos because of the eye catching obnoxious(good obnoxious haha) orange throughout both the photos. \n\nUmm I dont know what else to write..

Their little \"three generations\" guarantee needs to have the supporting fleshed-out legal summary of how exactly they handle their returns. This is basic stuff for any e-commerce company and even sites made on Shopify come with a boilerplate return policy summary included. These guys are just begging for issues with their current setup. I know it's \"fun\" to start a business, but it blows my mind that no one of any experience or authority has ever mentioned to them that \"we guarantee your products against production defects for three generations\" is not remotely appropriate here. If those are the sentiments you'd like to capture in your guarantee, then sure, go right ahead and make that claim- but you better link to a separate page in which you provide an in-depth explanation of how it functions. Have a lawyer draft this up for you or (at very least) find a copy elsewhere and repurpose it for your needs. If an Albatross rep ends up seeing this post, feel free to reach out to me for more info.\n\nOP isn't immune from criticism here either. I'm not aware of any company (especially smaller startups like these) that would accept returns/refunds on a handmade leather piece that is supposed to age uniquely with time. With items like this, the second you begin using them and subjecting them to wear, you begin customizing them. Clearly, it can no longer be resold by the vendor. At the end of the day, OP knew he was taking a gamble by ordering a $40 handmade wallet from a brand new company that just wrapped up their Kickstarter (i.e. \"it was just $40\"). You get what you pay for. Fine leather of solid craftsmanship doesn't come cheap- **for a reason**. \n\nIf ALL of Albatross's wallets have these same dimensions/there is no actual \"defect\" present, then this boils down to OP failing to do the research on the product before he bought something and simply not liking what he's agreed to pay for. Is 9 days longer than he should have waited for Albatross's initial response? Absolutely. Poor customer service kills small startups and this will be a huge lesson for them. But OP blowing them up on a form like this because of a case of buyer's remorse? I'd argue it's in extremely poor form- especially since he's clearly indicated in the comments below that he just emailed with them again **yesterday** and is waiting for their response.

{"id": "d0rjyju", "body": "Hey, sorry for answering so late, but I think this might be relevant.\n\nA real good web designer to me will understand desktop, tablet, mobile devices, email and other mediums, how and when to use them, what their limits are and how to make decisions that will work well in all of them, and will propose graceful degradation when things don't work. They will understand that there are limits to what you can display (resolution and space-wise). They have a good understanding of how CSS flow works, will go mobile-first, won't leave the devs alone taking the hard decisions when things end up not working as they should. They also understand that each view will need proper error handling and display. They understand how user input works and have good working knowledge of UX. They won't take the easy route to solve problems (make the fonts too small to fit content, use retarded concepts like cramming everything into expanding areas, are common culprits). They will be able to develop both graphical and interaction \"languages\", by this I mean the layouts will be consistent (not use 73 margin and padding sizes, and will reuse UI components across the project). They won't reinvent the wheel each view or template, and will try to reduce their amount when possible. They understand that everything comes from a form somewhere usually and that everything is data driven, and won't make small changes each page that drive development costs really high because you can't reuse anything. They will understand the client, will do everything possible to understand their problems and business needs and try to solve them instead of proposing something that's only visually appealing. They won't take everything personally and will understand the need to leave their ego at the door. At the same time, they will be good communicators to present their ideas and will find a way to lead the client in the good direction when they will want something that is detrimental to their needs, doing it in a way that is professional and not judgemental. Client relationship will be one of their main strengths and patience is a good trait. Each project has its good and bad times, and they won't give up when it gets hard.\n\nRegarding the low barrier to entry for integrators, reality is the skillset is relatively easy to acquire. CSS and HTML while they have their quirks are still really easy compared to complicated backend or frontend development which requires being proficient at lots of libraries, understanding architecture, have some computer science / math understanding, know all kinds of specifications and processes and even sometimes some applied legal requirements (when working on things related to dealing with money and email especially).\n\nI think the UX/designers and programmers are going to be important in the future because a lot of the simple websites we used to do in agencies are being handled by clients using WIX, Shopify and other tools. What's bound to happen more and more is that clients who are coming in want high level of finishes and/or want to handle complex use cases that the WIX and other tools are not able to handle.\n\nI personally went to programming because that's what makes me tick, the pay is much nicer, it's easier to find a job and generally clients will be less of dicks to programmers. I still will do design work from time to time and it's quite handy to understand design as a programmer but you can't be great at everything and I decided to focus on programming.", "subreddit": "montreal", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnmr", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1457403264, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_48nylj", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "cykelpop", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1460501873, "parent_id": "t1_d0mx30q"}

{"body": "Hi there. I work at a web host so I can provide a little bit of insight. First lets get some terms cleared up:\n\nShared Hosting - This is pretty much a big machine (or a not so big machine if it's budget hosting) that has a ton of users on it sharing system resources. You are not guaranteed any portion of resources on a shared hosting environment, which is usually fine if you are just getting started and your host isnt complete garbage. Caveats here would be that you need to be extra careful about your file and database permissions and ownerships. You are also at the mercy of other users resource abuse on the server - IE some user is running a sale on their moderately successful site, they are eating up all the CPU and storage IO, and your site (and everybody else on the server) is now crawling with 3+ second load times. You can usually clear this up pretty quick by contacting your host's support (again assuming your host is decent) but where this really sucks is when you are the user using the resources, your sale is going great, but now you've been told you need to tone it down a bit. Also worth noting, you're tied to the system resources of a single host. Meaning if there is a hardware issue, your store is going to be down while that is being resolved.\n\nDedicated Server - This is an actual physical box that you lease where you are the only user who has run of the resources. You are the only user logging in, etc. It's yours. This is is as 'old school' hosting as it gets. You can think of it like renting an office or store front in a stand alone building. A dedicated server is going to give you the most access to the full resource pool of the 'host' - because you're the only person pulling from that pool. The main caveat here is a single dedicated server setup, at some point a physical component will fail or need maintenance - and you will be down during that window. Dedicated servers also tend to cost quite a bit.\n\nVPS - A VPS is a 'machine' that is running on a hypervisor that is tied to a single host. Parellels Virtuozzo is a good example of this. The main benefit of a VPS over a dedicated server is that you share the cost of the server with other users who have their own \"containers\" on the server. This is like a mid-ground between shared hosting and dedicated hosting. The main caveats to VPS hosting are that you are still tied to this physical box's resources - making you subject to the same problems of dedicated hosting - but with the added caveats that you are technically sharing resources with other users as well. This can usually be seen in latency to storage, and time on the CPU - or in other words the same issues you'd see on shared hosting for resource usage. Unlike shared servers, you are not subject to the security risks of a shared hosting environment - at least theoretically. It depends on if you have a competent host or not. IMO VPS hosting has seen its time in the sun, and is probably ready to be retired. It has largely been replaced with cloud hosting.\n\nCloud Hosting - Despite what a lot of people think, not the same as \"VPS\" hosting. Cloud hosting implies you have a \"virtual machine\" that is not tied to any single host for its resources. This means it can be migrated host to host transparent to the end user. This will usually be tied into some sort of network storage system. This means your machine is not subject to maintenance periods from all but the most catastrophic events. Again, this is more secure than shared hosting, probably cheaper than dedicated hosting, and you are still sharing resources with other users on the host. Like dedicated and VPS hosting, this is your environment and you are the sole user within it. The big wins for cloud over VPS is that your 'machine' can be balanced on the fly to not feel the resource sharing as hard as you would on a VPS. A competent cloud platform can see that a particular host is overloaded, and will migrate you to a new one. The same could also be done for your storage IO, but that's typically not as transparent to the user. Still better than being stuck on a crappy VPS with bad neighbors IMO. I'm a pretty big cloud advocate.\n\nNow - why would you host your own domain? Depends on what you're doing with it really. I'd need to know more about what your end goal is to answer that question. The company I work for is more focused on e-commerce than anything. For e-commerce, hosting your own domain has a plethora of benefits, especially if you have tight controls you need to implement to satisfy your payment provider. It's also usually a means of controlling your costs. Somewhere like shopify is going to have their fingers in your pot the entire time, and your application is only so customizable. \n\nAnyway, that's just a quick and dirty overview of some terms you might see and need to be aware of. If there are more specific questions let me know and I can try to answer them.", "id": "d0sohnn", "subreddit": "webhosting", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn3h", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1457479540, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_49kin2", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 11, "retrieved_on": 1460521334, "author": "networknewjack", "edited": false, "ups": 11, "parent_id": "t3_49kin2"}

{"body": "Buyer protection isn;t even at the top of my list of eBay issues. \n\nThey double billed my seller fees and it took three months and considerable effort on my part to sort it out, they never admitted they were wrong, they blamed me, and they fought and won the dispute I filed with my bank. (They LIED and claimed I'd authorized both payments, I sure as hell didn't.) If an upper level manager and Paypal hadn't stepped in, I never would have gotten it resolved. \n\nI have severe issues with all of eBay's technical problems, some of which have been around for ages and ages and they make no effort to fix them.\n\nThe whole design of their site is out of date. They haven't kept up with the times and I waste SO much time (and time is money when you're listing) fighting with their site. (I cannot tell you how much easier it is to list stuff on Shopify.)\n\nIt's their bot that deactivates listings and gives me a defect when I was breaking no rules. (I believe I've vented before about listing a fake fur Barbie coat and getting a defect because you can't list counterfeit items. Then when I called to protest, I kept getting reps whose English was so bad that they couldn't parse the difference between a fake fur Barbie coat, and a fake Barbie fur coat and it took me days to get the defect removed, and I got throttled back to nothing on sales.)\n\nIt's that they deliberately throttle sellers and limit their sales, based on their own internal logic, including hiding listings that I've PAID to have listed. \n\nTheir customer service reps are rude, clueless, barely speak English, and can't tell the difference between the hold button and the disconnect button.\n\nI could go on ... \n\nThere ARE other issues with selling on Facebook, but they're of a different kind. I've never had an eBay buyer commit to buy, then fail to pay, then the next day spam me with chain letters (\"forward this letter to nine of your friends in 90 seconds and 9 good things will happen in the next 9 hours!\") and then renege on the deal when I failed to forward the chain letter as requested ... but, hey, it beats the guy who gave me a neg because an item took more than four days to go from Arizona to Australia.\n\n(Most eBay selling groups have a feedback file where buyers and sellers can leave comments about each other. I've actually seen a buyer leave an unwarranted neg ... and other buyers promptly dogpiled him and told him what a POS he was, and other sellers said they were blocking him, and then somebody figured out he was a minor and actually told his mom and she made him apologize.

If you are happy to use their payment service (you can add your own too) then you should go with Shopify. It's $29 a month and they take care of everything for you. You don't need to worry about server or service management at all, and for a simple ecommerce site that is a huge plus. Great social media integration as well, and a very good administration interface. Lots of great themes available. There's a reason Shopify is so popular -- it's awesome.\n\nHowever if you are skilled in server administration, you want/need things that Shopify's $29/month plan doesn't offer, or you can't use Shopify Payments (not in USA etc) then you will probably want to use a different platform. Not offering Shopify Payments will result in you paying a transaction fee to Shopify, and that sucks. Most modules/plugins for Shopify seem to be licensed monthly rather than sold which also sucks, as you are paying higher monthly costs forever. In this case I would probably go with a small VPS provided by Digital Ocean or Vultr. Vultr has a $10/month plan that would be awesome for running a WordPress site.\n\nIf you're looking for a middle ground you might consider something like Cloudways. They provide optimized application installs on top of existing cloud platforms. That same $10/month Vultr VPS I mentioned above is $14/month through Cloudways and for that they provide the optimized application installs (Wordpress, PrestaShop, etc) for you. It's not as easy as Shopify as you still have to manage upgrades yourself but it's easier than rolling everything on your own from scratch.\n\nPersonally I have gone with Cloudways on Vultr for now, and am using PrestaShop.

Take Shopify, get a Facebook-Page, integrate your shop into the Facebook page and get a couple hundred dollars to advertise the shit out of it.\n\nAnd about your suppliers. If you have no other option, you need to take pre-orders and agree with the suppliers on the lowest possible amount to order, otherwise, find other suppliers or do it yourself if you can.\n\nI have no idea who you are, if you have a job or not or what your background is.

Something like that.\n* I love the processing.js stuff in the header, use more of it! Maybe make the logo do something cool when you hover over it.\n* The design is a little bit drab, there's not much to it which can be good, but I think you can make it better by finding a few themes you like and copying good parts. Here are a few resources: [Shopify Themes]---LINK---, [SiteInspire Shops]---LINK---\n* \"An interactive store for art made with code\" isn't a link but it looks like one.\n* The photos of the T-Shirts w/ the artwork on them look very fake. The T-Shirts are wrinkled, but the graphics aren't. I know this is difficult to do, but I would suggest using product shots of T-Shirts that aren't wrinkled.\n* I didn't understand some of the product instructions: 'press q to escape...', I would change keyboard commands to buttons: eg \"Freeze Design\", \"Tweak Design\", \"Change Color\", etc\n* Is \"John Brown\"/\"db\" the designer? if so, you should have it work sort of like [Threadless]---LINK--- and say, \"Designed by XX\" or \"Coded by XX\" and maybe use the submitter's Gravatar or Twitter Profile Picture.\n* Change \"Take Home\" to \"Add to Cart\" :)\n* Change the \"Links\" page to an about page and tell us about the company, how you thought of it, why you chose Processing, etc. You can have those links on there, but this page should be a lot more IMO\n\nLet me know if you need me to clarify any of this!

Seems like users of any existing apps would have to be frustrated with the other options out there though. There are some free things and some paid things around $7/mo but nothing that's simple and intuitive and a complete package, from what I've seen so far, similar apps clunky at best. One of the core building blocks of Drupal is fields, has been for ages. Seemed like a big hole in Shopify that support for your own fields was lacking.\n\nIf you were pricing the app, what would you charge? Keep in mind, Shopify takes 20% right off the top, and there's hosting and whatnot to pay for (not that more or less overhead creates more or less value to the user, but it does need to be taken into consideration). I see other apps charging 50 or 100/mo or more and I feel the same way you do; \"I can't see myself paying that for what they're offering\", but I do think that there are use cases that the fee is much smaller than the value it would deliver. For example, someone selling parts or something with many different attributes. Pricing and free trial periods are a real head-scratcher for sure.

Could I sell an e-commerce site to someone with a huge ecommerce need?  Depends on huge.  Amazon?  No.  An online retailer for bicycles?  Yes.\n \nHeres my take.\n\nCapability - I'd argue you can make the Shopify API do most of you need - upload new products/images, alter based on user generated content (which is what my site does with Shopify, and was the main thing missing from most ecommerce platforms). You can extend it as much as you want.  You don't need to use the 'website' tools at all other than the products/order tracking/inventory parts.   If the site was really big and needed max customization, I would take a closer look at Magneto Enterprise Edition (mainly for support).\n\nMarket - If you are building and supporting a tool, it's ideal to use a platform with support and a large community to keep your sanity, and focus on where the business truly drives value - on the customer and brand.  Most businesses just want a website to get their product on the web, make it look awesome, and make it available to buy easily.  If you can do that, the business will value you.\n\nFor learning purposes, totally worth it to build your own.  Stab out the features, get it MVP'ed, and let'er rip! \n\n Business risk wise, I wouldn't go for it when either open source and/or $20 month options are available that do the job well - unless I had a specific need that could not be met and that impacted my customer experience.", "subreddit": "flask", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s1s3", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1458044860, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4agkf2", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "vinnieman232", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1460656810, "parent_id": "t1_d10anhy"}

It's absolutely not the only CMS option. There are others like Joomla! and Drupal, both PHP CMS's, that solve the same problem.\n\nFor small sites with static content (that is, non-changing or rarely-changing), there exist a number of \"Static site builders\" like Jekyll. These are very developer-focused so I wouldn't use one for a client site. They're a great solution for a personal portfolio site (though wordpress/etc is fine as well).\n\nThere are e-commerce specific frameworks like Magento. \n\nThen there are software-as-a-service things like Squarespace, Wix, and shopify that seek to cut out the developer entirely by providing a \"drag and drop\" website building experience.

He'd likely be paying a lot to the POD company to ship these items there, so in turn he's gonna have to pass on a higher rate to the end customer to make up for that., which is going to drop those conversion rates in those far-off areas of the world, like Australia.  \n\nIf you set this up on two different stores as dshine mentioned above... one with an integration to your US POD company, and the other with an integration with your Aussie POD company, that would be the best method. You could stick some javascript in your theme to pick up on the location of your customer, and if they're in Australia for example, and they somehow end up on your US shop, you could have a modal pop up recommending they visit the Australian site.

What would you do if you posted to Etsy and got 25 (or more) orders for 20 bags each? Do you know how you will scale?

{"id": "d15qwrs", "body": "Etsy and Shopify are not different brands of the same thing. \n\nEtsy is a marketplace. It allows potential customers to find you. It's comparable to ebay and Amazon (you may not realise that Amazon, as well as retailing their own products, also allow third parties to sell through the Amazon site). Because Etsy specialises in handmade products, you have a slightly better chance of being found by potential customers.  Etsy don't charge monthly fees, just a sales commission. However you can also pay a daily \"relisting fee\" which puts you back at the top of search results. If you compete with others with similar products, you realistically need to pay that fee, or you won't get found. If your product is \"too original\" ie no one is searching for anything like it, you might have trouble connecting with any customers, in which case Etsy might not be a good fit for you.\n\nThe problem with investing too much time or SEO into an Etsy business, is the business becomes over-reliant on them. If they change the rules or prices or get over-crowded, you can move to your own site but any SEO work will be lost.\n\nBut you can easily sign up, make a decent profile, and list one or two products at virtually no cost and maybe a day's work including writing; play around with $20 of advertising, and see if it's worth spending time and money taking it further. That's basically a separate decision from whether you want to have your own ecommerce site.\n\nShopify is one way of making your own ecommerce site. Shopify are managed and hosted, which basically means they take care of the underlying technology for you, then give you templates which a reasonable person can set up themselves. However you'll still lack the experience of knowing what makes a good setup. From my point of view as a web developer, they charge a lot (in monthly fees) for relatively little, but I can see the convenience for someone who doesn't know where to begin.  You can hire someone to help you get set up on Shopify.\n\nAlternatives to Shopify include Squarespace (I haven't used it but the general word is they are inferior for ecommerce), and Weebly (definitely inferior, but used to have a free option). One free approach, which I did for my wife's craft business, was to make a very simple website with a few pages for free, then used \"Ecwid\" for the ecommerce side of things. [Ecwid]---LINK--- is a fairly sophisticated shopping cart that is fairly easy to integrate with any other website. Free for up to 10 products.\n\nFinally you have the possibility to have your own ecommerce site. This would most likely be built with Wordpress + Woocommerce (widely supported), or possibly Magento (a bit more corporate). Since you're asking here, you probably wouldn't be trying to set this up yourself. You'd hire a developer, who would advise you and build your site (usually using existing plugins and templates, rarely more than a little custom code, but that's fine). You're looking at a higher up-front cost but perhaps lower monthly charges (some developers seem to charge a ton for monthly maintenance, but a well-designed site should need minimal maintenance). You'll have the widest possibilities for customisation - for example if a typical order is 20 pieces, you might have non-standard requirements around shipping, or paying by invoice.\n\nIn terms of design, I'd suggest not focusing too much on colour or design concepts. Firstly, because these things are generally easy to implement at the end, regardless of your choice of template. Secondly, because you do need to focus on your sales copy, product descriptions and product photography. Thirdly, the answer is pale background, minimalist design, avoid unnecessary widgets and social media buttons; big photos, clear calls-to-action, uncontroversial fonts and for god's sake no Comic Sans.

Heres my take on building a site:\n**Website**\nFIRSTLY - figure out your budget. There are a ton of website builders, services, and VA's to help you start a website. If you have let's say $30-$50 budget for a website, Shopify is the way to go. Utilize their free themes and *quickly* set up shop. Keep updating your site from there.\n\nI have used some of their free themes. I found \"Simple\" theme was clean and works well for shopping. It has an [etsy]---LINK--- feel to it. You could also, with some CSS skills, make it similar to [NOVICA handbags]---LINK---\n\nIf you have $150- $200 budget, you might consider purchasing a theme. However, I would still utilize Shopify's 14-day-free-trial and purchase a $160 theme only if you're doing well after a certain period. With all the free services they offer, you would feel like you have a lot of legroom to stretch out and test the waters. This is the route I took!\n\nTheir premium themes could make your site look more lively like [moopshop]---LINK---\n\nI know a lot of people recommend wordpress, but I find it a lot more complex than Shopify. Its a steeper learning curve. To save time and effort, going the Shopify route *first* may prove to be more effective. When I had the idea for my site, I managed to publish it to the world in 5-6 hours.\n\n**Instagram**\nPerhaps you might want to look to Pinterest as your main social media platform. I know it might not be your cup of tea because men rarely use it, but that's exactly where your target market is.\n\nThe wide majority of Pinterest users are female, according to Pew:\n42% of online women use Pinterest.\n13% of online men use Pinterest.\nThe network also skews toward a younger demographic:\n34% of adults 18\u201329 years old use Pinterest.\n28% of adults 30\u201349 years old use Pinterest.\n27% of adults 50\u201364 years old use Pinterest.\n\nIf you do intend to use Instagram, perhaps you would like this [tool]---LINK--- You can use it to follow people who follow your competitors, essentially *inviting* your target market to *follow* your page. Its very cheap too, I've gotten 1200 followers for $5.\n\nA lot of people recommend GIVEAWAY events to spike your follower base. I haven't done this yet, but its on the tip of my mind!\n\nGood luck with your venture fellow entrepreneur.

There is an excellent book you should read called \"Predictable Revenue\" by Aaron Ross &amp; Marylou Tyler, where it talks about how old school methods in the 90s seemed to work great, but now businesses and customers are getting smarter and it takes new approaches in marketing to meet your adjectives - many without requiring massive ad budgets.\n\n3. Partnerships - Again depending on your industry, look into similar services or platforms and how your startup can benefit both of you. We recently partnered with Shopify to build a Shopify App.. Yes it took us more time to get our product to market, but now we have this free application where we can grow potential traffic and leads from. \n\n4. Preorder is a nice concept for a product type of startup, where you can discount the item in hopes of raising funds early on, but just be careful with selling the cart too early. \n\nAnother good book I recommend is \"The E Myth\" by Michael Gerber, where it talks about why most small business fail and what you can do to get around these bumps and achieve success.

At the moment these mom &amp; pop shops are my daily bread, though there might, one fine day, be bigger clients on the horizon, who knows. From my experience and from the mentality of the clients I work with they are all happy with me and willing to pay good money because they say the trust me to do the best I can without charging for every little thing. For example making a site responsive down to IE8 is something I am doing not because I am getting paid for it but also because it makes me proud to know how to do this and the benefit is being passed to the clients as well. Though this last point has little to do with the topic.\n\nSo yeah if you mind sharing your anger or bad experience about WP and WC that would be truly appreciated.\n\nThat point about Shopify might actually be a really great idea, put Shopify on a sub-domain and done.

This is part of the source code of every page on just about every website online today.  Your Analytics tracking ID is UA-56100357-1, for the record. View your source, search for that ID and you'll find it. You'll also find it on his website's source too.\n\nWhat likely happened was the other guy copied your page and, being unexperienced, did not recognize that analytics tracking ID and script for what it is. Google doesn't care what domain the website is on; it assumes the ID is valid no matter what. So he copied your analytics ID and is now feeding that ID page views. Those page views are logging to your ID and your account, even though they are originating from a completely different server with a different domain. \n\nFor instance, I could build a page now and then put your ID in it and log page views for your pages, if I so choose. \n\nAs I said, there's not much you can do about this.

There's a link there you'll need to follow to establish a Test Profile. That's really important to do. \n\nIt's a headache, man, I know.

Most people think of \"oh I could walk around this store in VR\", but are you really going to spend thousands of dollars in order to take you to the mall? No. If you're shopping for camping gear, you probably don't want to be in a VR camping store, but rather be on the actual mountain/forest/wherever that you'll be using the stuff. Brands can be amazing storytellers with this medium. Let's help that happen.\n\nWe're also heavily looking beyond shopping and ways to empower our merchants. As a quick example, you could load up a 3D model of your product and test out the best box to ship it in. It works surprisingly well with hand controllers and is super intuitive. Stay tuned for more.\n\nThis photo is of an event where we were getting ~600 partners to try out VR.

Although, more you work with Shopify, more you want to quit it,  and the greatest reason is that to get all the cool features you have to pay over $280 monthly (plus transactional fees), if not, your shop will  look like a looser.        \n\nMagento is an open-source platform, and that is the main advantage of it. However, in case of Magento, you have to take into account that you will need a dedicated hosting service. Furthermore, CE by itself, lacks the unique design, tailor-made for a specific corporate image, and has no pre-set, country-specific individual configuration (e.g. delivery and payment settings, system e-mails, confirmations depending on language, specific functional, and so on). And if you want to add all these lacking features, be prepared to spend well.         \n\nA better solution for you, in my opinion, would be Contus. They offer a powerful turn-key platform with everything an e-commerce business needs in one solution. That means you won\u2019t need to use plugins, extensions, or develop your own integration's.

There is still some hair pulling with shopify but for the most par\n\n2) Addons - When you start to get deeper in to WP/WC you find that you are going to need plugins to implement sort of useful features. More plugins mean more possible points of failure and generally more money. I find that I can get more done with the basic shopify install without resorting to plugins\n\nSmart Collections/Categories - The ability to create smart collections on Shopify is a huge plus for me and my customers. I have been working with a camera shop recently they wanted a collection with all their \"Canon\" products. I had it created for them in 2 minutes and on the navigation menu. \n\nSocial Selling - Selling via Facebook, Twitter and Pinterst is integrated for free and very easy to use. A few clicks and you are all sorted. \n\nEase of use - Depending on which plugins you have installed in WC/WP the backend can get quite cluttered and confusing.

{"id": "d1cn68u", "body": "Time to step back a bit.\n\n1. Business in general. Starting a business is not easy or cheap. Shopify will charge you an amount each month just to run the shop, eBay would take a percentage as fees, your payment processor (Paypal or otherwise) will take a cut to move money around. That's before you start looking at the cost of stock (you'll be buying these watches from someone else before you can sell them to anyone), marketing (how are you going to find customers?), running the business (what're your tax obligations? Know a good small business accountant? What does it cost to register a business where you are?). These things are all time and money before you sell a single item.\n\n2. Watches. You can get a cheap watch anywhere - what will be special about your shop? Do you offer fast shipping, free shipping, good recommendations for watches, can you offer them particularly cheaply? What's your unique selling point, why would someone buy one off you instead of another shop, eBay, Amazon? People don't just come and give you money for things just because your shop exists, even if you can hone in on models that 'sell well'. You've got to provide better value somehow. How will you do that? The market is flooded with cheap watches, and it'll be tough competing on price even if you're buying in bulk - and if you do, how are you going to shift 1000 of the same G-Shock, when there's like 50 different colour schemes and everybody likes something different? If you're interested in watches, come over to /r/watches and read a bit, ask some questions, see if there might be a market for something you'd like to do. If there isn't a reasonably clear opportunity, don't try and start a business doing it.\n\n3. What do you really want to sell? If your heart is set on doing something with watches, why not make straps? There's a fair few businesses out there that were built just on making and selling watch straps from leather and other materials. Cutting and sewing straps isn't too hard. Maybe you could identify a USP in that market to exploit - maybe nobody's doing them in a particular style, or you can offer completely custom straps with any material/colour, maybe you can invent a self-closing buckle or something. You're more likely to turn a profit making and selling stuff of reasonable value yourself than reselling already cheap items... but I'm not saying you'll make a profit at all.\n\n4. You're in college. Have you got time to start and run a business amidst your studies? If you're looking for something to cover your expenses, something you can throw a few hours a week into and earn some cash, starting a business isn't likely to do it. You'd be better off working for someone else, biding your time and thinking about what business you'd like to start later on. I don't want to put you off - this sort of thing can be ridiculously rewarding, but it could also be ruinous if it's not done right, or (as it might turn out) if there's no market to sustain the business.", "subreddit": "smallbusiness", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qr34", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1458875215, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4butnu", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "ups": 3, "author": "timix", "edited": 1458877292, "retrieved_on": 1460866264, "parent_id": "t3_4butnu"}

(If they require an EIN (tax number) usually is a good initial indicator that they are legit.\n\n2. Definitely, definitely-- use Instagram to build brand awareness as well as making a few sales.\n\n3. You have good images, but customers want to also have the functionality to zoom in on the clothing. I like those long jogger pants in navy blue, if I was in the mood to buy them right now, I would not buy them unless I could zoom in and get a closer feel for them. --&gt; Usually in the theme customization you can enable zoom for the products. \n\n4. The Size chart seems like a great idea. \n\n5. Update About us page: \n-Don't link to FB like that. In shopify you can link a word with the url. So you can say something like check out our Facebook Page! and \"Facebook Page!\" would be highlighted in blue and when clicked would link to the page.\n-Add image or something to fill space in about page.\n-Saying you sell anything from shoes to sun glass doesn't do much for the customer. Maybe you can say something like: Here are WorldWide-clothing we offer a large variety of fashionable street wear, whether that be the NYC urban shoes, to the chic sunglasses, or boutique urban clothing.\n-Also fix sun glass to sunglasses or whatever.  \n\n6. I looked at the product page for some products, and the FREE SHIPPING!!! with three exclamation points and all caps letters makes it look like a discount store. I think Free Shipping! or something along those lines is fine. Shopify might have free app which highlights free shipping on products in a more appealing way.\n\n7.

WooCommerce handles it just fine, it's a standard \"out of the box\" feature that takes the box sizes you provide and \"packs\" them, then gets a shipping quote with the weight and box. I (wrongfully) assumed this would be standard with other shopping carts. The only one I found that supports it is BigCommerce, which looks fine until you get [into the pricing]---LINK--- their highest plan allows for 3000 orders **a year** after which it's and additional $80 per 1000, PER MONTH. Based on my order volume over the last year, my monthly costs would be between $500 and $700; assuming no growth. That's nuts.\n\nAnyway - yesterday the clouds broke for a few hours after I got home and I was able to do some work on the shed, which was a good thing since I didn't eat dinner (the kids ate [Hot Pockets]---LINK---, my wife had a Keto Chow) though I also fell over backwards twice, got a real nice bruise on my rear. I also ran again. I did \"mess up\" and technically broke my fast when I took two fish pills after brushing my teeth - 15 calories each. CRON-O-Meter says I could eat 2892 more calories to reach my weight goal.

I would suggest if you are starting to just make a website on shopify or start an Etsy shop to sell direct to consumers that way you won't have to slash your pricing for wholesale. Start a business page on Facebook and Instagram strictly for the brand. Facebook ads work great and you can also host a giveaway to attract attention. I host instagram giveaways and people love it.
