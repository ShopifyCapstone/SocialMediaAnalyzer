You can definitely get rich, but you have to be amazing at sales, have the right contacts and the experience. One of the best sales people I know used to be a jigalo.\n\n&gt;5.Programming (Python, Swift, Javascript a good programmer is always in demand)\n\nProgramming in itself will not make you rich. You have to be an amazing programmer, do you know how hard it is to get a job at google? My brother turned down a 110K + 80K sign bonus at microsoft to pursue a job at google. Meanwhile he's getting 20K offers to write programs for small business.\n\nYou can't just be a programmer, you need to be topping your computer science class to get this kind of money.

I'm 3.5 years into a 4 year Product Design Degree - on top of that you will need to learn object oriented coding as well as Unity, as well as how to create 3D models in 3DS MAX (even making models takes hours). At the end of the day your app has a 1/50 chance of making over 200K.\n\n&gt; 8.E-commerce (Selling on Amazon or your own product on Shopify)\n\nAgain over-saturated market.

Its actually one of the main reasons why the bed-in-a-box mattress industry has been so succesful. \n\nHowever, also keep in mind with a printing business you'll be primarily marketing to other businesses.  B2B marketing is a bit different strategy than B2C. Admittedly, I don't have a ton of experience with B2B search marketing...especially in australia. But I do know that businesses are typically much harder than a regular consumer to convert from their existing vendors which they have established relationships with. They're also much more likely to do extensive price-comparison shopping before ordering.\n\nOne benefit of your business model is a similar benefit to a benefit Dromma has - selling a made to order product, with little up front investment in assets needed. That means you can get an inexpensive website going, and start running some marketing experiments without a lot of up front capital or risk.  \n \nThat being said - if you're serious about growing the business quickly, you will need to have a fairly substantial advertising budget. \n\nIf you're just looking to dip your toes into it - you could start with a cheap woocommerce or shopify site, and allocate $1000 or so to run some advertising experiments.

{"id": "d1ljtxz", "body": "Ok, so the thing that sticks out to me is this: you're selling a service to get potential clients noticed, but your website is so....well...bland. \n\nI think you're going about this all wrong with the bowtie picture, Shopify listing like it's a physical product, etc. I think you need to give your entire sales pitch before you try to sell anyone on anything, and then you need to give something away for free as well. This will build trust. Here's what I would do:\n\n**Step 1: Relate to your potential customer.** Who are you? Open with a blurb about how much being out of work sucks, how scary entering the job market can be, how you felt before you had a job, etc. Say things like \"I always thought it would be cool be able to wear sweat pants all day...boy was I wrong\" etc. Build a little bit of trust. \n\n*Now I know you're saying \"Well dude didn't you see the ABOUT ME section?\" no...no I did not. You have 5 seconds to keep the average person on your website, and I spent 3 of those seconds scrolling past a giant torso picture. So no one will ever see that tiny link on the bottom of the whole website*\n\n**Step 2: Scare the EVERLIVING SHIT out of your potential customer.** Talk about student loan debt, how many people are loosing their homes, how competitive the job market is. Remind them that every minute they're unemployed is another minute the unexplainable gap in their resume grows and their bank account shrinks. Your copy should make the hair on their neck raise, heart rate speed up, and anxiety go through the roof. You need to create urgency so that you can close sales without people leaving your site to research competitors. \n\n**Step 3: Empower your potential customers.** Tell them there is hope, but it's going to take a lot of work. A lot of pounding the pavement or expensive recruiters. Play up how much work goes into finding a good job.\n\n**Step 4: SAVE your potential customer** Tell them that YOUR PRODUCT can get them out of this downward spiral, get them into their dream job, and do it much quicker. This is where you actually sell your product. \n\nThere are some basic things you need to change for this. You need a proper logo, because the site looks like a powerpoint template and that's exactly the opposite of what you'd want a resume to look like. \n\nThe most critical thing is that all of this copy is bark, and there is no bite. You tell me what you do, but you don't show me. \n\nSo you need to show people what you do. Maybe before and after pictures? Maybe video testimonial? Hell even some boxes with quotes that say \"Resume Chief landed me a six figure job\" Andy, Quality Control, General Motors would help. \n\nUltimately I think at the end you should have two options. A cheaper downloadable PDF template that allows someone to make it themselves, and your full service resume writing service. I think you should sell these with buttons that simply say \"Hire Me Now\" or \"Yes I want my dream job\" or something like that. Then offer a free ebook or something, just a little \"10 tips to getting hired faster\" to collect emails or something. \n\nIt's not a particularly \"cool\" area of business, but you can make it cool and you can make it dramatic and sexy if you try.

A lot of those requirements already have great solutions available to you and will save a lot of time that would have been spent on development, and in your case, cost, if you are going to be hiring out.\n\nFor example, payment processing can be handled completely by something like Shopify if you don't need a ton of customization and want a \"store\" like feel. Another option would be Stripe if you just need someone to handle the processing.\n\nUser account creation can be done with nearly any language + database combo, so for this it really comes down to what you're comfortable with.\n\nAdding APIs works with most languages as well and the companies themselves offer those features for a large number of languages. If you want to see whether a language or framework is easily integrated with an API, just check their docs.\n\nSSL Certs integrate fairly easily, depending on your hosting providing you may be able to have them install it for a small cost or if you have root privileges, you could install them yourselves. If you go with someone like DigitalOcean for example, they offer a ton of guides on how to do it yourself.\n\nSearching can be tricky depending on how advanced the criteria is, the data, etc. This again can be done with any language and a database, but there are also 3rd party solutions.\n\nMessaging in between accounts is something that can be done with any language as well.\n\nSome of the answers may be vague, but what I'm ultimately getting at is, the answer to the question really varies and depends on what you or the developer is comfortable with. If your comfortable with Ruby on Rails, there is not much point in recommending PHP or node to you. Also, try to find suitable 3rd party solutions where possible, since it will cut down drastically on development time and cost.", "id": "d1obku2", "subreddit": "webdev", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1459707647, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4d72d0", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1463192369, "author": "rfizzy", "edited": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_4d72d0"}

{"id": "d1pksz0", "body": "Those are some good pointers. I've been thinking about photography, but haven't pushed on it yet. Fulfillment is something I've also been working on. I too wanted to include some extras, whether it's something simple like stickers a little bag, or whatever, haven't really decided what would be a best fit yet. Have you read anything on effectiveness for the extras? Do people really care about the post cards or stickers? I'm kind of looking at it as extra opportunities to get the name out there, so things that might be highly visible are a big plus to me.\n\nNow to answer your question on the shop. I am going a drupal route. It's a bit (or a lot) more involved than wordpress, but it's got a really solid foundation to stand on. Operating costs is something we're really watching. It sounds like we're doing a much smaller push than you are, so shopify's few hundred a month or so operating costs cut a lot deeper on us so web hosting at $10 a month is pretty ideal. Having the background with it as well lets us make some cool changes without the additional costs. It can host our store, multiple blogs, pages (like about us, marketing, contact us, etc) very easily as well. It has tie ins for paypal and just about any other payment authorizor as well as shipping for ups, usps, fedex, you name em. I also plan to really fine tune the site by tracking the metrics, which isn't something I think I'd be able to do as thoroughly with shopify. I think shopify and the like have absolute advantages as it launches and it's all off your shoulders, but I always worry too much about growing beyond 3rd party tools and being somewhat stuck in them once that happens. Drupal is a 3rd party tool as well, but it's more flexible in this instance, and like I said, having the development background, it doesn't add any costs at all. I also like the single point for everything. News Letters, Metrics, Fulfillment tracking. I'm not sure to what extent shopify lets you handle all of those items, but I know with drupal, I can make it do just about everything.", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1459791709, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4dbjli", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1463213952, "author": "john-dev", "edited": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d1pk0yu"}

Both from development and support point of views.\n* Updates --  If your laravel tie-in expects specific WP functions or data to be available, what happens when WP or plugins updates?\n* Auth Concerns -- Both WP and Laravel have auth routines/functions. Can you be 100% sure you're handling all auth touch-points in a secure way when you connect the two? Do you really want to write a custom set of auth wrappers for laravel to work with WP?\n* Security Concerns -- WP has a lot of security concerns by itself and is a HUGE target. By combining the two into a franken-project you're likely going to end up creating more insecure code in places (realize it or not) and may end up making it easier for people to break in.\n\nIn short, if you need a CMS with Ecom support, go for WP + WooCommerce.  Is it perfect? Nope. Is it likely the best option? Yes (debatable I know...but this isn't the place). If WP+WooCommerce isn't up to your liking, look for other options such as shopify, Joomla, Drupal or any of the other CMS products that exist on the market.\nIf you want to use laravel because you prefer it, then you're going to need to write your own CMS with Ecom and should expect to spend a lot of time \"reinventing the wheel\".\n\nLast thought:\nSlamming X into a project \"because I prefer X\" is normally a bad idea regardless of the language or framework.

It doesn't seem to offer that much product variation options from the sites I see as it pulls from ETSY.\n\nIt's smart on ETSY's part. They see shopify taking a lot of their users and want to offer an outlet to put a stop to it. They see a lot of people probably jumping ship in the future and going their own way with their own site. I guess they're trying to tackle this issue on their part.\n\nI agree 100% w/ you. Someone looking to branch away from ETSY should not use this, as it's still ETSY. ETSY can still ban you and guess what, you're shit out of luck as you're still using their platform. You don't write your own rules as you're still following ETSY's.\n\n\nMaking a site yourself is a bit of work, but it's worth the effort. There are still payment/transactional fees, but at least you're not on ETSY's leash.\n\nPattern also has duplicate content issues. If you can't mod your theme (not sure if you can or not, haven't dug too deep into it) then you're hit w/ conversion UX issues.

Good rule of thumb is that the easier it is the more people there are doing it and the less money there is to be made.\n\n", "id": "d1sa1bq", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1459959596, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4dlsq1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1463260277, "author": "mindbodymash", "edited": false, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_4dlsq1"}

{"id": "d1t4qzk", "body": "Try selling something online.\n\nThere seems to be 2 types of entrepreneurs that I've met in life: 1) the researcher / analyzer that takes forever to do anything.  My cousin is a great example. She has a Harvard MBA and spent 4 years analyzing and researching a product that she finally produced and is on the 8th year of trying to make it work and she still has not made a single penny. She is stuck in \"analysis paralysis\".   2) The jump right in guy.  That's me. I don't like to waste time.  I've started many unsuccessful businesses. I would quickly determine they wouldn't work and moved on to something else. By accident, I found a successful little niche with a high profit margin: Rosaries\n\nStarted a rosary business in October 2014 with only $300 in materials in my dining room. We now have 7 employees plus me, and grossed 350K in 2015.  We moved to a commercial space in March 2015. We are on track to DOUBLE revenues in 2016!\n \nI did form an LLC and yes I pay $800 each year for it here in Cali.  I also spent quite a bit to register my trade name but it was worth it as now we have become known in our niche. \n\nMy advice if you want to try online selling:  \n\n* Start small but think big from the start.\n* Don't be afraid to fail.\n* Don't ever go into debt.  Grow only as your cash allows. \n* Find a niche that needs filling or sell something other people are selling successfully. \n* Make good use of cheap but easy to use e-commerce platform like the one I use, shopify.com.  I can't tell you how easy this has made my life!  I also use ShipStation along with it for shipping which saves so much time. We easily ship out 50 to 60 orders a day with ShipStation.\n* And speaking of Shipping, it helps if your item is easy to ship, such as clothing or something smallish.\n* Sell something with a high profit margin.  \n* As revenues and volume increase, purchase in bulk any products or materials so as to get them much cheaper. I literally purchase 180,000 beads at a time, and since I can buy in such high volume, I get custom made beads designed exclusively for our rosaries.\n* Open wholesale accounts with wholesale suppliers, obviously.\n* If you are selling products, photography is paramount. \n* Advertise: Start off with facebook ads or free social media like instagram and try to get some followers. Social media has really helped sky rocket my business. You can start off really small with FB ads, but be sure you target your niche audience.  If your customer demographic is easy to target, your ads will perform better.  Mine is very easy - Catholic Men.  I spend roughly 10% of my revenue on advertising.  If I spend 100 per day on facebook, that usually will return at least $1000 in sales, usually more.  When I found the products that sold best, which took me several months to figure out through trial and error, I then ramped up sales by hiring college kids part time to make the rosaries and ramping up the advertising.  It worked. \n* Be sure you learn how to do accounting or hire an accountant\n\nThese are just MY opinions.  A lot of people would say you could do a lot better by leveraging credit for example. But I don't like being in debt for anything and always pay cash for everything. GOOD LUCK.\n- Shannon\n", "subreddit": "smallbusiness", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qr34", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1460001748, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4do3q5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 40, "retrieved_on": 1463274914, "author": "shannodot", "edited": false, "ups": 40, "parent_id": "t3_4do3q5"}

{"body": "I'm a past president of the MUN Computer Science Society and an executive member of the Computer Technology Society of Newfoundland and Labrador. I attended MUN for almost a decade and know the university, and more specifically the department exceptionally well.\n\n&gt; 1.Should i join?\n\nI can't answer that for you.\n\n&gt; 2.How is the student life at MUN?\n\nExceptional. There are few universities that can hold up to the social life at MUN, assuming you get involved.\n\n&gt; 3.SociAl life?\n\nThat's not the University, so I won't comment.\n\n&gt; 4.Upto what extent on a 1-10 scale do you recommend MUN?\n\nScales suck, I'm not going to grade things. Just read the other answers.\n\n&gt; 5.Part time Jobs to meet my living expenseS?(Off campus)\n&gt; 6.Monthly living expenses?\n&gt; 7.can we manage the monthly living expenses by doing part time jobs?\n\nNo idea. But it's probably about the same as most places.\n\n&gt; 8.I would like to take BSc Computer science(software engineering),so how is the computer science programme in MUN?\n\nComputer Science at MUN will be what you make of it. The curriculum is rather dated at the moment, but is getting a refresh this coming fall. Also means that the software engineering stream doesn't exist anymore. You can find some details in ---LINK---,_2015.pdf (document is subject to some change). The software engineering designation for the CS program was probably not what you were thinking it was anyways. It's just taking a few additional courses and means little to nothing once you are done. I would recommend checking out the document linked as it contains updates to the university calendar that you won't be able to see until they are finalized in a couple months.\n\n&gt; 9.Job placements?what are the job prospects after undergrad?are people who are undergrading from MUN getting placed in good jobs?\n\nGetting a degree at MUN will not get you a job in the software field. You will need to learn things outside of your university experience, or use your classes as an opportunity to learn more. This is not unique to MUN, but the case for most universities. If a university claims otherwise, they are probably lying. Software development is a skill, and like all skills, needs practice. Do some side projects, show your worth and you should have no problem getting a job.\n\n&gt; 10.CO-OP one of the main thing thats putting me a step behind,because the universities which i got into especially Waterloo are shit awesome at co-op,what about MUN?How are co-op placements?\n\nComputer Science at MUN has an 8, 12 or 16 month work term that most prople are encouraged to take. The work term placement office sucks, so you will need to do some leg work on your own. There are several local companies that hire students for work terms and there have been several placements with IBM, a couple game companies, and other big names in the past. If you choose a 8 months work term, you are generally given the option to increase it to a longer one. There are usually only a dozen others looking for a work term. You can also get permission to do a course while on the work term. And some local companies also offer part time employment after the work term is complete.\n\n&gt; 11.how many work terms is manditory for degree requirement?(also tell in months)\n\nNothing mandatory, but there is a window for when you are eligible for the work term.\n\n&gt; 12.Length of course?for BSc Computer Science(Software engineering with co-op? and also what if non co-op?)\n\nThe usual 4 year degree, but most people do it in 5 years. It's more if you so the work term.\n\n&gt; 13.For co-op can we go all around the world to work orelse only in new foundland?\n\nAnywhere you want, as far as I know, as long as the employer is willing to work with the MUN science co-op office. People tend to stick to Canada due to visa requirements (I think).\n\n&gt; 14.Climate?How is the climate there?I heard its always foggy and windy?is it?is it really unmanagable for an international to survive therE?\n\nWinters are usually around the freezing point, can be lots of snow and ice. Not exceptionally cold, but sometimes can dip below -10 C. Summers are usually in the mid to low 20s C, but can peak into the high 20s. We get a fair bit of rain, but it varies from year to year. Wind can be bad here and can take some getting used to, and the fog normally doesn't harm anyone. MUN is set up so that once you get inside, you shouldn't have to go outside until you go home (if you live in the residence, then you never need to go outside). \n\n&gt; 15.Faculty?How are they?\n\nWe have some exceptionally great professors, as well as some shit poor professors. We have one professor that did her PhD under Stephen Cook (look him up if you don't know him), and several others who are exceptional in their fields. We also have several older professors that are pretty much useless, but you can get past their courses and move on. The faculty is mostly very friendly and easy to get along with. By the end of your degree you are generally on a first name basis with several of the professors. The department is also very responsive to the students, and has incredible relationship with the Computer Science Society.\n\n&gt; 16.After the bachelors where should i go?is there a good job market in New foundland itself?\n\nNewfoundland job market is okay, but not exceptional. Wages here are a bit below that of the rest of North America, but are going up. There are only a couple large tech companies, and no big world renown names. Undergrads from MUN have gotten jobs with Google, Amazon, Shopify, Microsoft as well as others that I can't currently recall.  \n\n&gt; 17.How much can i make through co-op's?\n\nVaries greatly on ability and company. Co-op's are required to pay at least minimum wage (~$10-$12/hour depending on where), but generally are much higher.", "id": "d1tgvaw", "subreddit": "newfoundland", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzqt", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1460034810, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4dm7pw", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "ups": 3, "author": "mitmaro", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1463280755, "parent_id": "t3_4dm7pw"}

{"id": "d1tpga0", "body": "&gt;1.Should i join?\n\nI donno. You should decide that.\n\n&gt;2.How is the student life at MUN?\n\nMUN has a pretty good student life. Low tuition. Decent things to do. Professors are always approachable because theres generally small class sizes in CS.\n&gt;3.SociAl life?\n\nIf you enjoy alcohol you'll love St. John's.\n\n&gt;4.Upto what extent on a 1-10 scale do you recommend MUN?\n\nUh. Hard to figure this out. Theres not really a scale\n\n&gt;5.Part time Jobs to meet my living expenseS?(Off campus)\n&gt;6.Monthly living expenses?\n&gt;7.can we manage the monthly living expenses by doing part time jobs?\n\nSt. John's is a bit hard to find a part time job, and I'm not sure on the visa requirements for working in Canada. St. John's isn't that expensive of a city compared to Toronto or Vancouver or any of the \"big\" cities. I haven't lived in St. John's in 4 years so probably not the best to answer.\n\n&gt;8.I would like to take BSc Computer science(software engineering),so how is the computer science programme in MUN?\n\nThe Honours option in Software Engineering is just additional coursework. You can achieve everything you want from the general programme. Also I think they're changing it soon, so that is probably being dropped. CS at MUN is pretty much 'okay'. Nothing great. Nothing awful. Some professors kinda suck, some professors are good. Just focus on learning on the side. It's a lot like most other universities outside of the \"big cs universities\" (Waterloo, Toronto, UBC)\n\n&gt;9.Job placements?what are the job prospects after undergrad?are people who are undergrading from MUN getting placed in good jobs?\n\nI'm at Amazon. I know someone at Google. I know someone at Shopify. Theres lots of jobs available across the globe. A MUN CS degree is just as god as a CS degree from any other Canadian university. It's all about proving you can apply your skills.\n\n&gt;10.CO-OP one of the main thing thats putting me a step behind,because the universities which i got into especially Waterloo are shit awesome at co-op,what about MUN?How are co-op placements?\n&gt;11.how many work terms is manditory for degree requirement?(also tell in months)\n\nMUN has the CIIO - 8, 12, 16 month Internship. This is actually kinda awesome because: a) you're a third year when you do it so you know a lot more fundamentals b) It gives you more than 4 months to practice and build on the skills and iterate and see a full SDLC c) The co-op placements are what you make of it. MUN has a lot of local and a handful of Canadian connections. Nothing is stopping you from applying to the \"big companies\". And nothing is stopping you from doing a summer internship (as long as your visa allows it I should say).\n\n&gt;12.Length of course?for BSc Computer Science(Software engineering with co-op? and also what if non co-op?)\n\n4 years for a standard undergrad (if you do it all without dropping any courses and doing a full workload or doing summer courses). Generally it takes a bit longer for the SE option since its an Honours degree and you need to do a thesis/project.\n\n&gt;13.For co-op can we go all around the world to work orelse only in new foundland?\n\nSee above answer.\n\n&gt;14.Climate?How is the climate there?I heard its always foggy and windy?is it?is it really unmanagable for an international to survive therE?\n\nSt. John's has a pretty moderate climate. Lots of snow. Lots of rain. Lots of fog. But it never gets \"too cold\" or \"too hot\".\n\n&gt;15.Faculty?How are they?\n\nThey'll probably learn your name. You'll be 1 of about 20 in a class. This makes it easy to talk to professors. Easy to ask for help to. Some faculty are good. Some bad bad. The good generally outweigh the bad. And, most of the courses the \"bad\" teach can be learned from a book/slides/online. Thats how I did it.\n\n&gt;16.After the bachelors where should i go?is there a good job market in New foundland itself?\n\nUp to you.\n\n&gt;17.How much can i make through co-op's?\n\nDepends on the internship and where you do it to (as an example, cost of living in Toronto is higher, and interns are generally paid more).

{"body": "Hi there.  I see your confusion...  Here is my humble opinion...  I think that since you have a website with a shopping cart that you seem to be happy with, then you should stick with that.  Shopify has various options so if you wanted to refresh the look of your site without having to do a lot of programming, then Shopify could be a good option (by the way, I am in no way affiliated with Shopify...this is just my opinion).  Since you are happy with your website then stick with it.\nHowever, I think that if you have a store on Etsy and if you have a web site with a shopping cart, that seems like 2 stores.  If you are selling the same things in both stores, then that may not be the most effective way to go.\n\nSo, you might want to sell a few items at your Etsy store that are special (perhaps a pearl collection for example...I am just making something up for an example).  Then work on marketing that collection (i.e. wedding season is coming up, prom season is coming up; perhaps this is your spring collection).  The key is to make your activities on Etsy to be focused so these items will not be available on your website.  You can use your Instagram, Pinterest and Facebook profiles to help to promote whatever you are doing on Etsy.\nDo you have a following on social media?  If so, then you should create a reason for them to check out your new collection for spring/the prom/wedding season at your Etsy store (depending on who is part of your social media following on Pinterest, Facebook, etc.). Maybe you want to do a special promotion based on a particular theme.\n\nYour website (the one with the shopping cart) should be your home, meaning that this should be where people find out more about you and what you have to offer as a jewelry designer/expert.  \n\nI hope that this is helpful for you.  If you have any more specific questions or comments regarding this post with respect to your situation, you can always send me a PM.

You don't really \"rent\" domain names. You buy them in one year increments. No matter what registrar you buy from, a domain name will always work the same way.\n 2. If you do not have hosting behind your domain name, then there is nothing to access. When you register a domain name, it is immediately yours. But you have to do something with it before anything happens. It's just a blank address otherwise.\n 3. The domain name itself needs no maintenance, really. Just remember to renew it every year, or just buy multiple years now, or setup automatic renewal at the registrar. You are probably thinking of hosting?\n 4. Adobe Dreamweaver is okay to start learning the basics on, but it's not something a professional developer uses. The WYSIWYG-editor spits out some nasty HTML code that is not up to snuff with what even an amateur can produce.\n 5.

Any data you give away is such a small dataset for them I wouldn't worry much.\n\nIf you're in between jobs, I would not drop ship at all actually. Drop shipping is more on the lines of starting a \"proper business\" and it takes time (usually it doesn't pickup in a week, it can but most often it takes longer) to develop. What you should do is check /r/flipping for a quicker buck. You just buy some used stuff, slap it on eBay or send it to Amazon FBA like I currently do. You'll have higher margins and the business is much more likely to post an almost immediate profit because what you're selling is coming up to millions of users. However on the flip side I don't recommend used items as a \"proper business\" because it's really really hard to do without the backing of a 3rd party marketplace. You simply won't be able to advertise much when you only have one item for each SKU and your inventory likely changes too often to specialize in any one niche.\n\nTLDR; Dropship if you got a few months to work on building a business, building a niche following through advertising.

{"id": "d1wbur8", "body": "Hi DanielB,\n\nI'm happy to give you a response that might provide some clarity.\n\nIB use to offer payments in USD, CAD, EUR and GBP, over a year ago when we used an open source e-commerce platform. Only about 8% of the payments were in CAD, with about 90% of the payments done in USD.\n\nClose to a year ago, we switched over to a very professional and robust platform called Shopify, for dozens of reasons. We love Shopify and it was a great switch for us, it made our lives easier in so many ways and our business increased substantially since then. The one limitation with Shopify (at the moment) is they only allow transacting in one currency. They tell us that multi-currency transacting is coming but it's not a fast and easy fix.\n\nBecause we operate in the USA and Canada and the majority of our retail and wholesale business is in the USA, it makes sense to use USD. Also, 99% of our products are bought in USD and EUR, so pricing in CAD wouldn't make sense because we would be constantly adjusting prices on an order by order basis. The Canadian business is much to small to justify a base in CAD, or running a separate .ca website.\n\nThe harsh reality is... Canada is not a great business environment, it's small, it's vast, the laws and taxes aren't conducive to growth, and their are many hurdles to operating successfully in Canada, such as super high shipping expenses and crazy duties. Canadians many times don't realize how lucky they are to have the USA as a neighbor, Canada would be a very different and very expensive country if we didn't. I love the USA, the American people and what they stand for, in fact I spend about 1/5 of the year in the USA where I'm an investor and a US tax payer. God bless America.\n\nWe have to run the business in a way that benefits the majority of our clients, because these clients keep the business alive and thriving. We love to make everybody happy but we can't micro-manage the business on that level and justify it's existence. Just yesterday a customer told me he would never shop with IB again because we didn't offer the Plissoft Monster is the exact handle shape he wanted. Sometimes you have to let customers go because it's for the good of the business overall.\n\nI think we are providing a fantastic service to Canadians, we provide free shipping in Canada for any order over $60, that includes places like Northern Alberta, the Territories, Newfoundland, etc, where shipping sometimes costs us $20-25 a parcel. We also bring to Canada our RazoRock and ItalianBarber branded products which I believe offer some of the best value in the world. We work with many US artisan producers to bring many hard-to-get products to Canada; sometimes it's no easy task because of the nature of the products.\n\nIn terms of pick-up service, it's just not possible with the way we run the business, for various reasons including privacy and security. It would really be a super small niche because most orders are shipped free and most of the others are shipped for under $7 which wouldn't justify people's time and fuel costs to pickup. If we had a retail location to browse that would be a different story but we can't have people in our fulfillment center.\n\nIB is far from perfect, we know that, but we are trying our best to serve our clients in the best way possible, and making changes where possible to improve and get better.\n\n-Joe", "subreddit": "wicked_edge", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s46m", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1460222962, "author_flair_text": "my store: ItalianBarber.com", "link_id": "t3_4dzf1a", "author_flair_css_class": "3", "score": 7, "retrieved_on": 1463329783, "author": "RazoRock", "edited": 1460228077, "ups": 7, "parent_id": "t1_d1vrvsr"}

For some people its not worth it because they rather do it all themselves and i completely understand that point of view but when we first started doing the fulfillment ourselves we were running around like headless chickens, our packaging is very intricate since we fit a variety of products in one box so we decided early on to package everything and send it to amazon for them to fulfill our orders. Additionally, as a small business the shipping cost is a killer but once you do it all thru amazon you get the amazon shipping rate which is phenomenal for large items like ours we had full pallets going into FBA so we def saved some money there.  \n\nIn regards to being a small fish yes that is so true you can however benefit from creating the listings with an amazon pro acct in which they help you create a listing that can come up higher in their search results.

I do think you should try it maybe not send all your inventory out keep some and since you are creating a shopify store you can start seeing what selling channel works better.

{"body": "Good starting point! Hopefully this feedback will be of use: \n\nWhen we are building VR experiences at Shopify, we try to make sure we aren't *just* doing VR because VR is cool. People will have fun trying a demo for the first few times, but after that it actually needs to be useful to them for them to come back and use it again. After all, I'd much rather shop for something on my phone or laptop than have to put on an HMD. It's just more convenient.\n\nSo what's an experience that is actually more helpful to do in VR than in other mediums? I'd say anything to do with scale. If you're buying a bike for example, it can be tricky to use online sizing charts to figure out the right size. In VR, the bike is in front of you and depending on the HMD, you could even walk right up to it and see if it's gonna be a fit or not.\n\nFor your example of the boots, they are just spinning around at a fixed point, and it provides no real benefit over a video of them spinning. In our ---LINK--- demo, we tried to add interaction by letting a user press on a shoe and then be able to rotate around it using their head. This may feel more natural to the user than spinning something with a mouse. Or maybe not. Just something we are trying.\n\nA lot of times when I talk to people about commerce and VR, their heads immediately go to this idea of a mall or retail store in 3D. While there is some benefit to that, I don't see why we would go through all the effort of recreating an experience that is as boring as a mall. In VR you can be anywhere and do anything. If you could have superpowers and materialize anything around you, would a box store be your first destination to visit?\n\nThe example I like to give is that if you are shopping for camping gear, would you rather be in a virtual camping store, or on the actual mountain/forest that you'll be in. Brands can be amazing storytellers in VR, and it's our jobs to empower them with the tools needed to create those experiences.\n\nAs for the buy button, I think it's going to depend on the HMD you are browsing it in. For our Shopify demo, we knew that the majority of people would be looking at it through a cardboard viewer and that people generally don't spend more than a few minutes in there. In that case, when a user finished adding stuff to their virtual cart, they were told to take off the headset and take out their phone. At that point, they saw the regular shopify checkout and could just checkout from there. No one was going to be sad that they were brought out of the VR experience because the checkout was the last step in the process. A VR-based checkout would be a waste of time in this case. But for other HMDs like the rift of vive, where you can easily stay in for hours, the experience may not end at the checkout. Maybe they can do things past the checkout, and for that reason they need to be able to do everything while in VR. That's a trickier problem, and something we are working on :)\n\nHope this helps! It was a bit of a brain dump :P\n\n\n", "id": "d1xeogk", "subreddit": "WebVR", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_33ble", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1460306836, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4e215c", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 4, "ups": 4, "author": "push_matrix", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1463348313, "parent_id": "t1_d1wqtlc"}

{"id": "d1xn7ej", "body": "That was very constructive, thank you for taking the time to share your insights. I noticed that beyond the demo, there has been an increase in organic traffic to the vr. subdomains. Some sites have seen USA sales that never existed before - not sure if that has to do with the new organic traffic.\n\nDisplaying scale makes total sense and what you and the team have done with the shoes kick is slick. Another reason to have VR e-commerce is to show the product actually working similar to demonstration videos or trade shows. The link in the OP has laser pointers that turn on when you gaze over them, exciting for those who discover it. VR e-commerce stores could allow the visitor to be immersed in the brand with environments, interactions and emotions. Imagine a live avatar helping you shop with a real person helping you on the other end, just like live chat now. Right now you can build a theater and show product videos in style. \n\nYes! When I searched for previous 3D store concepts they were all lame malls or stores. I wanted to transport visitors to somewhere interesting and went with this: vr.lasershop.ca\n\nI'm completely fine with sending people to a non-VR checkout atm. I love the message to remove your headset in the Shopify demo. Soon A-Frame will have smooth traversals between webpages where you still stay in VR and who knows maybe a VR checkout can even be made for cardboard/mobile. Perhaps we could have a virtual keyboard we could gaze at to type or make it faster but adding a SwiftKey like option with predictive text.

It's good to be an optimist but you have to have a realistic perspective on things. \n\nSecond! The amount of time that its going to take to develop that \"CMS\" he wants to develop is way to valuable. If he wants to create something from scratch he needs to \"survey the marketplace\" about what they would like / be willing to pay for. NEVER build anything based on \"assumptions\" only to find out the market doesn't want what you created after you spent months developing it. \n\nFind out what the market wants FIRST, then build! \n\nWhat I would personally do is have him consider building applications around Shopify, Squarespace or WP. All these platforms have challenges that if solved for people they would be willing to pay. For example the WooCommers app for WP is not as easy as Shopify or Squarespace as far as setting things up. If you could save WP users the agony of having to learn code just to set up a store you would have a business that could generate revenue. \n\nAnother reason is that all of these platforms already have large communities and \"BUYING\" customers. Keyword there is BUYING. Which means rather than creating CMS system from scratch and convincing people to buy it, you align yourself with companies that already have BUYING customers which sets you to run a start up that can generate revenue rather than \"users\". \n\nJust my .02!

As for where to begin, you don't need to keyword-stuff, in fact that could hurt you if it's clearly done in a spammy way. Just make sure your page titles and meta descriptions (which should be easily editable -- looks like your site is in Shopify, so here's a potentially helpful link: ---LINK--- ) contain words that make sense from a search perspective. If you were your target customer looking for this product, what would you search for? Handmade leather wallet? Men's brown leather belt? Search engines are getting smarter, and take into account related words as well. One good exercise is to Google what you think your target customers would Google and see whose page comes up in the search results. What are they doing that you aren't? Obviously sites that already get more traffic will rank better, but they probably have copy practices you can learn from, or user experience bonuses that keep people on their pages longer. Moz is a great resource for learning this stuff. Look into their Whiteboard Friday series. HubSpot is also really accessible -- less technical, but very helpful on an introductory level. Google Analytics CAN be super frustrating, but you can start by just going to Behavior &gt; Overview and look at which pages are ranking the highest for number of visitors. Go to Acquisition &gt; Overview to see where your traffic mostly comes from. You can't see exact search terms unless you have ads running, but a general idea of social/referral/search traffic will be helpful on a very basic level. Here's an article my colleague wrote on basic Analytics info: ---LINK--- I'd definitely recommend Facebook ads.

{"body": "Nice photos; did you take them yourself? I'm taking a look at the site now; I'll edit this comment when I'm done.\n\n# Review\n\nSo, the site actually looks relatively decent overall. I took a look at the code + UE for the site. I'll touch on the big issues that I found, but don't consider this an exhaustive list:\n\n## Imagery\nYou need to optimize the header images for your site. The homepage hero image is 2.4MB, and adds nearly 500ms to your load time. (You're halfway to 1s with this image alone.) \n\nYou should also take a look at the other images; there doesn't seem to be a set width you're defining for any of them. For images under ~600px wide, I usually do 2x for retina screens. (So an image that needs to be 600px on the page should be SAVED at 1200px.) For larger images (like hero images), I do 1.5x, since it's not reasonable to find super-large images at that size.\n\n## Performance\n\nYour site took an average of 3.24 seconds to load. I aim for 1.5 seconds with any eCommerce site I build. Most of this is your images; specifically the hero images. However, FontAwesome takes ~500ms to load, as well. I'd consider using Fontello to load *only the icons you need.* Right now you're loading the entire FontAwesome library.\n\nDouble-check your TypeKit 'kit' and make sure you're only loading the font weights that you need. (Common thing that happens is including the entire font for testing, and never going to back to remove the unnecessary ones.)\n\nConsider making a sprite for all your smaller images to cut down on your total requests. You have 79 to load the home page. (Specifically, make the social icons a sprite.)\n\nWhatever 'hotjar' is, it's the longest load-time you have on the site. Took an average of 602ms to load 404 bytes. *Something's weird here.* The server you're requesting this from is *really* slow; you might consider removing it or replacing it with something else.\n\n## Code\n\nYour site's declaring HTML 4.01 Transitional instead of 5; that's a little dated. If this is a theme, there isn't much you can about it without hiring a developer (unless you're a dev). I thought I'd mention it, just to be thorough.\n\nUse [Schema]---LINK--- it's a minor addition that can make a significant difference in some industries. (Google occasionally displays your schema information.)\n\nAlso, BuiltWith is having a field day with your site. It's apparently saying that you're using Rails, WordPress, AND Shopify, somehow. If you have any old code, or you're actually somehow doing this, get it fixed. This can't be good for your bandwidth or performance.\n\n## Hosting\n\nI'd get off GoDaddy at all costs. They're not a good company, have bad practices, and\u2014barring all that\u2014they're a slow host in general. \n\n## UE\n\nWhen you're writing web copy, the art of it is addressing the user's needs/wants/problems, not telling them who/what you are. They should gather that from the fact that you're addressing their needs.\n\nFor example, on your homepage you have this text:\n&gt; At Turvani, we make exploring exceptional teas simple. As you try and review our teas, we'll recommend others that you'll love, based on their flavors.\n\nThat's fine if you're simply looking to get *text on the page.* I'd consider writing something along these lines:\n\n&gt; Experiencing exceptional tea shouldn't be hard. Discover a refreshing new flavor every month as you explore Turvani's collection of loose-leaf tea; we'll listen to what you like and suggest other flavors.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n---\n\nThat's about all I have time for right now; let me know if you have any questions!", "id": "d22r9gn", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 1, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1460651683, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4erolu", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1463440455, "author": "ROInDis", "edited": 1460730830, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_4erolu"}

{"id": "d25jx5q", "body": "Thanks so much for your reply, really appreciate it. \n\nFirst I'll address the headaches: \n1. New page\nIf I wanted to create a new page couldn't I just make a new html page from scratch and add it as a link like normal? Are there any problems here other than the fact that I would have to get it to match with the theme? Other than visually, would there be problems with integration that I am not aware of? (the site doesn't use cookies AFAIK but something like making sure the session tokens match is something I could see being an non-visual problem with integration). \n\n2. With changing the layout\nIf I copy all of the html and css files (they happen to be the same file in this case, not sure if thats common of wordpress sites to have the styling in the same file (no outside stylesheet) but it seems to be great for my case) shouldn't I just be able to just modify them as I normally would with HTML/CSS or am I overlooking something?\n\n\nComments are not an issue because there is another section of the site that handles all \"customer support\", it is already standalone and not wordpress so I dont think that needs to change at all. The e-commerce by shopify, however, is a concern. I'm unsure whether that was plug-and-played with wordpress (I assume it was) and I dont know what challenges that poses for my conversion to stand-alone. \n\nFinally, I find the advantages you mention to be very interesting because they are the same concerns the owner of the site mentioned as to why he wants to switch and I had some questions about that. I see how cost saving is a benefit - no longer paying wordpress. Performance I don't understand as well, how will my standalone site be faster if it is still all static-html. I can understand how it would be faster if it were written in react or something totally different, but why would me serving static html be faster than wordpress serving static html? Lastly, what security benefits can be expected? If anything I would think wordpress would have better security than some rookie with static files. As far as I can tell the only part of the site that would need \"security\" would be the e-commerce but that is all handled by shopify and I would like to have that be the case even after wordpress. \n\nAgain, thanks for your feedback!\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Wordpress", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhjq", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1460837113, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4f38yl", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1463488459, "author": "2xws", "edited": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_d25iwbz"}

Our service will eventually be a monthly/annual paid subscription - but anyone that signs up, until we reach 250 active users, will get a free subscription for life. \n\nWHAT DO WE DO? We've partnered with multiple different Ecommerce platforms (ebay, esty, shopify, magento, etc..) and built a dashboard where you can see and complete all of your pending orders all on the same screen. Each shipping label you print yourself, big and small, is discounted lower than what you would receive at the post office - and you can schedule a pick up right on the dashboard. Some of our clients have reported back to us saying that by using our software it has trimmed the time it takes to fulfill orders by 70-80%.

Uno tiende a sobre estimar sus ideas y la mayor\u00eda fracasan despu\u00e9s de invertir mucha guita y quedarse sin un centavo porque se dan cuenta que necesitan 10 veces lo que invirtieron.\n\nYo te recomiendo armar un buen plan de negocios con alguien que sepa y te pueda asesorar (ie, alguien que le haya ido bien con algo similar). Despu\u00e9s asum\u00ed que de ese plan de negocios quiz\u00e1 un 20% de lo que asum\u00eds va a ser verdad, y fijate si est\u00e1s dispuesto a invertir tiempo y plata en eso.

This book is going to be about all teh stupid fucking [QUOTE1] I made myself in this book\n\n* One quote I didn't mention. ***Do things the wrong way first if it takes very little time and next to no repercussions***, as learning from failures helps you make better decisions. *People who fucking save scum / save whore in fallout4 in skyrim are probably the best examples of this*. In order to to do *research, on the topic, by say finding secrets in the game, outcomes in different scenarios, blah blah blah*\n\n* Because there's no repercussions here, cause its a fucking video game. How does this apply to real life? Great fucking question. R/codingchallenges, posting a comment on reddit anyhow even if you think its blatantly fucking wrong so you can learn it the right way, ***building my monster^2, trying out desk idea solutions that were retarded /r/techmygver style because it bought out all the ideas- bad and good***. I rigged my mic to have an audio studio level mic moving arm using cheap shits I paid $15 for roughly-ish (that could be expensive though)\n\n* Other applications of ***purposefully doing shit the wrong way first***. In RPGs, no different, you always want to find the fucknig dead ends first. In real life, \n\n* * In real life, you see this behavior in shopping A LOT. \n\n* * \"OH I gotta open up a new store for XYZ!\" . \n\n* * \"Where should I buy everything\"? Option A: Locally, Option B: Online, Option C: Other local option. Option D: Amazon. (Scantron test style choice G)\n\n* * \"Well Amazon should be the best, but let's give those other solutions a shot anyhow! Maybe amazon sucks balls for shipping furniture (cause its always from fucking china and disassembled, specifically Weiye industries is a big one). *at least the frames are*\n\n* * \"Eh , let's try local option and furniture company XYZ, I think they would suck ass, but its good to know my options are\"\n\n* * \"Oh look amazon does indeed suck ass for service-driven work, well I'm going to stick with Local Option A despite it being more expensive, less headache but higher cost.\"\n\n* * **There you fucking go, try out every solution no matter how stupid you think it may be. Because you might be surprised at all the fucking assumptions you made you prick.**\n\n* * *Its the same way in life* \"OH GUYS MY LIFE IS HARD QQ AND HARDER THAN OTHERS\", the thing is, *you can never make that statement* because there is ALWAYS someone who has it exponentially more difficult then you. \n\n* * Back to buying analogy. if you don't seek every potential solution out there, you might be doing shit the wrong and inefficient way most of your life\n\n* * In this retrospect, this is why I test and field test the shit out of many software solutions because I know how clicky baity and sometimes paid sponsor those blogs are. Fucking volusion is always sponsored on google for ecommerce, BLEH. Same fucking shit with Magento sometimes. Look for reliable, unbiased data sources, namely adding \"____________ Reddit\" on your google search\n\n* DIGRESSION: for mosnter desk below\n\n* Also, I totally finished monster desk^2. Monster Desk^3 is going to incorporate arduinos and stepper motors and those *bike chain gears* for moving treadmill like application banners. Monster Desk^4 will incorporate a photography backlit area probably for youtubing, and VR applications maybe. My monster desk book will include Ergonomics and kinesiology studies on chairs and standing desks too. ***And I will put my own studies here too. And fucking made stick shit diagrams with Force vectors n crap like that here too*\n\n-------------------\nNumber 8.6: Minecraft 16 Bit computer\n\n**Scaling a small distribution &amp; /or service-driven business**. What this book will cover: Best practices in the industry, NAW, it will talk about database management, about how to strategize and incorporate traditional media strategies, new methods of media strategies, and a few other things. \n\n* *I am not fucking exaggerating when I tell people I had the equivalent of an AA business degree by the time I went to college (probably even a B.S. level too and some topics MBA harvard level) *. Wish people fucking believed me, I've been working since i was 13 and driving a forklift before I even drove a fucking car, and paid off all my college shit from working so early in my life. Most of hwat I learned about business was through MMO GAMING ECONOMIES GROWING UP LOL\n\n* What will I will you about? I will tell you shits I learned in small businesses in other industries growing up, common pitfalls I learned through analyzing human behavior and corporate strategies growing up, through my own 5500 gaming experiences guild wars 1 and 2 by understanding that psychological aspect of it (but I will not mention it a lot, its not relevant) as well as applications of LEAN as well\n\n* In addition, evernote as a cheap CRM system, how to select your softwares such as JIRO, git hub, Freshbooks, etc how to properly vet and test solutions quickly, how to acquire information with my SPARTAN CARBON FIBER WEAVE WEB I toss over the web (\"Make the internet your bitch\"). How I've helped other companies in the past become successful and those that sort of failed (I've consulted at least 10-20 companies total growing up - despite none of it being on fucking paper LOL). Fucking shit, so many useless startups trying to pawn me off like fucking noname sponsors in guild wars 2 and riding coat tails\n\n* Anyways, specific strategies:\n\n* * Cataloging - how much should you pay, how should you outsource it, photoshop image asset developments, dirty vs clean environments, Requesting for manufacturer image assets, CMYK vs RGB for webdev\n\n* * Solutions Ecommerce vs wordpress vs shopify. As I've done a ton of fucking research over 2 years on this , and analyzed at least ~~2~~ 3 sites that were reputable and I analyzed all changes those companies made on their site on a bi-weekly basis, I will tell you about best principles of UX design and how big corporations implement these strategies. *Despite the fact I've never worked for XYZ company at all* just simply analyzing historical data and understanding how corporate meetings work gives you a strong indication of how decisions were benchmarked. \n\n* * Solutions ecommerce vs wordpress vs shopify continued: ***There's a saying from Warran buffet, on why he's investing in the dead-horse IBM - Warren buffet interviews CEO's and determines the potential issues in that industry - namely companies not switching off IBM software in the near future / legacy holdings, that Warren knows where the investments are to be made*** [Quote1]. In many retrospects, what Warren is doing is not that far off in how I benchmark my decisions, *except warren is mostly doing things from the top down prospective because he's got a buttfuck ton of resources* whereas I don't, I scrap by like a peon like that radio kid from africa building a radio station. \n\n* * EDIT: And, this is why this makes my book more relateable. Because all the resources I fucking use, you can use too, because you don't need to have a billion fucking connections to rich and  famous people for the most part. You learn from my wisdom and experience instead\n\n* * GOODS BASED INDUSTRY - how to source products. I might as well discuss this, basically how to negotiate with manufacturers in asia. I have a meeting with our billionaire vendor in a few weeks from today, *Perhaps* I will conduct an interview on what its like over there (and my personal experience growing up) on how Chinese corporations work (Government rebates n shit, cutt-throat business, stealing ideas, and bare minimal fucking investments like  ---LINK--- ).\n\n* * GOODS BASED INDUSTRY - CHINA SOURCING. Thomas.net is one example, I will tell you what things are good to buy and why, using things like importgenius, as well as going to different conventions, where those conventions are held, how to source difficult products, and how to handle freight logistics onboarding. Importdojo.com has lots of resources here , ***I am not an expert here since everything i know about logistics is ALMOST ENTIRELY SELF-TAUGHT***. Had to go fucking find my own mentors through books and blogs, jesus fucking shit. Wasn't fun. As well as Asiainspection / inspection companies.\n\n* * GOODS BASED - CERTIFICATIONS. How to get uL certificates, ETL, etc. (that reminds me i need to buy a book on these, going do it now!). *fuck me and my book buying habits, I do intend to reference and/or read/skim all 100 textbooks i have in my life, I invest early into PMT associations*. ---LINK--- ***I will eventually master speed reading past 1000 WPM so I can quickly acquire massive amounts of non-technical (noncoding / webdev) information super duper quickly***.

{"body": "Hi Dylan, so my apologized I just re read your post... Ok so having being running the PPC campaigns for a supplements company on amazon doing 250K / month I've learned a lot of grey hat and black hate techniques as to HOW you can truly complete the funnel when driving traffic from outside sources... I spend the better part of 2 years advertising product son faceobok making money through affiliate products so when my boss asked me my thoughts on Facebook ads to drive traffic to the amazon listing page.. I to was in a predicament as you are now.. for how can one measure the final part of the funnel.. which is the conversion.. Here's the answer... Coupon codes.. creating a very small 5-10% off coupon code ( for the outside traffic ) in doing this it allows your to track conversion % all you have to do is divide amount of redeemed coupons by total clicks ( on your ad that link to your listing ) this is the only way I know of... In regards to your other question.. in my early days online I spent 6 months creating little shopify sites drop shipping products from aliexpress and driving traffic with Facebook ads ( you wouldn't believe the targeting ability on FB ) and for 2 of my first stores I was really considering them just MVP ( minimum viable products ) so I just launched with one product... I can tell you I had huge success ! and it should not affect your sales ( to where its noticeable ) BUT... NOTE: when I added other products to those sites I was able to implement an upset and increase revenue by nearly 20%... I didn't drive traffic to these other product I simply had them as \"Upsell\" only products. In regards to you being on amazon If your not ranking page 1 for 3 seed keywords and atleast 10 - 20 branch keywords then I'd spend my marketing efforts there ( but this is slightly bias coming from me because I have so much experience in amazon PPC ) So understand what your good at and work from there...

{"body": "Interesting question, Sir. The big thing here is that you're technically not designing, you are more of an artist. These parts are overlapping in some ways. With that said, you obviously know what you want to do. Which is great! Most of us don't, some of us are trying to figure it out and some of us just accepted where we're at, some of us fight for it passionately. For example, other ways you could make money is by designing ads for an ad agency, or similar, sometimes they need illustrators, actually pretty often! The issue is you won't be your own boss. Sure, you can try to start your own agency, but with your skillset, I don't see that being super easy, maybe after a few years and connections? \n\nSo, back to how you can get where you're at. Do you screenprint? You could try starting your own screenprint-business, creating posters for local venues and selling your art pieces. IF you know friends who own apparel companies, you could try to get paid for a few designs and bring them some apparel designs. A lot of designers start out with graffiti or just drawing and they eventually start their own brand. Fact is, I know a handful of people who did just that, some gave away free designs for skate-brands until they got offered a job, some do collabs with others, some start printing on cheap blanks because they know a guy who has a wholesale account. \n\nA start would be to try redbubble or similar, see if people would buy your stuff before you invest in a printer and real stuff, if you're passionate enough, you can do it! Shopify even has apps that print your tees specifically based on order, so you don't even have to invest in blanks or inks, just a website and SEO!

Owner of t-shirt company lying about giving me my refund. What can I legally do to get my money back?**\n&gt;About 4 weeks ago I decided to splurge on my small savings to buy myself one t-shirt for my birthday since I don't have any clothes for summer. A week after my purchase I noticed the shirt never shipped, so I sent an email to inquire and the guy running the business said he had to refill the stock and it would be sent in a couple days. At this point my card company calls me to say my card information was stolen and upwards of 600 was attempted to be charged to me, but it was denied and my card had to be closed. I immediately notified the business that there site might have been compromised and the guy denied it and to complain to \"shopify\" the platform that connects client to business for purchases. I let that go since I don't have proof yet. 2 weeks later the shirt didn't ship and I emailed to inquire again, my emails were ignored. I then sent emails demanding a refund, those were ignored. Finally after persistent emails I got an email from him saying that a refund was being issued. I responded to him within 10 minutes that because of the card being stolen the account had been closed and no refund would be issued, I gave him the option of mailing a check or using PayPal. Again my emails were ignored until a few days later when I used the header \"IMMEDIATE ATTENTION\"  where I immediately got a email back saying that it basically wasn't his problem and to talk to my bank. Again I emailed him telling him I spoke to shopify and my bank and again the refund was denied because the account is closed, and again my emails are being ignored. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am a poor person and this money may not mean much to him, but it means everything to me.

{"body": "So congrats! This is something that's pretty doable, but you need to not only make some compromises, but also a couple shifts in your life to make this work.\n\nFirst off, you need to figure out if this is economically feasible. Figure out how much money you're making off of this each month. You need some solid numbers for this, so I'd say do three months at minimum, six months would be ideal. Once you figure this out, you can go and start making a game plan for this.\n\n&gt;I am 21 and currently going to school for no reason, but I am doing this art stuff as a hobby and seeing where I can go with it.\n\nSo question regarding this. Do you just not like your major? Because if you are still in school, one thing that could greatly help you out is if you go and take some graphic design/illustration classes. Note that I'm not saying that you're not talented, but rather that if you don't feel like you're getting stuff out of school, you should change that to what your really want to do. At the very least, keep going to college and get a degree. More on this in a bit.\n\nFigure out what you current expenses are, and what type of income you're aiming to go for post-college. This is important, because when you start to go independent, you've got no one to rely on but yourself. Understand that while this grind is great, it's going to take years before you can do it full time. To give you a personal example, I have a friend who does illustrations for the New York Times. It pays a good amount, but the work is inconsistent. So for awhile, she did that and also picked up shifts at Starbucks just to make sure she had a consistent paycheck.\n\nThis brings me to my next point. Accepting what it means to go and do this and going all in. Right now you're 21 and still in college. I'm not going to say your naive, but right now you've got a bit of a buffer from the real world. When you decide to go and dedicate yourself full time to this grind, it's going to be hard starting out.\n\nYou think you're successful now. That's true. But what happens in a couple months when sales dip? What happens if you go and have a dry spell, where it's now three months since you've made enough off of your work that you can't support yourself? Remember that this isn't about your ego now. Even the best freelance illustrators and designers have dry spells. Are you okay with deciding to go work at McDonalds to keep the lights on? Are you willing to eat Top Ramen for an entire month to stay within your budget? You good with living with 10+ other people to save month on rent? \n\nI feel like you're at the point where you are viewing this as an escape, and I want to ground you a bit in this. Once you decide to do this full time, there will be a nice honeymoon period where this all seems really awesome. But give it a couple months, or a year and you'll hit your first setback. And it's going to suck, hard. Be it a client who decided to short you for your project, or a potential freelance position that you needed that didn't pan out, you're going to be experiencing significantly more failures than successes first starting out. \n\nWhich is why the college degree is important. Don't care what you're studying, but at the very least keep doing it. Don't be a dropout. If for some reason this stuff doesn't work out, you'll at least have that. You're not Mark Zuckerburg, no one is going to look at your resume and consider you a serious applicant when you don't have a completed degree. \n\nAt best, if you really don't view your schooling as important, and you really do want to do design/illustration, I'd highly recommend going to school for it. Even if it means being in academia for a couple more years, the experience you'll have at a good art school will make you even better. I know creatives on the internet like to explain that you don't need schooling, but as someone who works for a very good company and has other young, successful people who are creatives around me, the one main differentiator between someone who's a 20 something and works at Google or Pixar and someone who's in their 20's fighting for a $200 99designs contract is that they took their education seriously and used all of the resources of the school to get them to where they are at now. \n\nThese places will also go and teach you important things that you'll be doing, like how to do a proper workflow and file management. How to go and work with different programs and mediums to further your work. How to draft up contracts and do certain types of projects which you'll be doing (stuff like album covers, or magazine spreads, or poster designs). \n\nBut, enough about the school rant, back to preparing yourself right now. \n\nIn addition to your Instagram, I'd go and create accounts on other places like RedBubble, Etsy, Threadless, dribbble, Behance, Shopify and Tumblr. Constantly push your work on all of those places. You need to keep building up your audience. Start connecting with other well known creatives and ask them for advice on how they made it. Stay humble, and always take your time to learn and grow. Don't settle and let your ego get the best of you. Cool, you got a following and you want to be your own boss. That's great, but everyone wants to do that. \n\nThe ones who do end up being successful are the ones who are smart enough to get ahead, but humble enough to know what they don't know and where they need to improve. Most importantly, the ones who end up making it dedicate every free moment they have to their craft.

{"body": "Yes -- First Data provides a payment gateway solution for online transactions. Clover systems are the physical terminals for on-site locations. When you open a merchant account with First Data for an eCommerce solution, I'll be setting you up with Payeezy, providing a virtual terminal, which integrates seamlessly with Prestashop, Magento, and Shopify (and tons of other shop platforms). I've personally configured Payeezy for use on WHMCS and Prestashop. Some platforms don't integrate well with it though -- for example, WooCommerce for WordPress sells a Payeezy plugin for a one-time payment of $80.00.\n\nI would imagine -- processors and banks lump all of those industries into what they call \"high risk\". Vaping's been becoming more common though, even in the United States, so I honestly don't think that'll last too long.\n\nAre you currently using Bigcommerce for your online store? You can continue to use it and set First Data as your processor in the administration panel: [documentation on this]---LINK---\n\nEDIT\n\nAlso, keep in mind, Square's rate is 2.75% + $0.30 per transaction. That doesn't include fees implemented by credit card companies. For example, Visa's standard card would apply an additional 1.89% fee. This can range all the way up to like... 4.04% if you accept Amex tallying up to about 7%. Nobody really brings these additional fees up but they apply to every transaction regardless of whether your using PayPal, Shopify Payments, or anything else. It's why a lot of people are unhappy with processing companies.\n\nFirst Data starts at 2.69% + $0.10 per transaction when you accept payments on your mobile device through Clover Go -- when you get a Clover Mini or Station, they rates go even lower. Rates are also flexible depending on how much your average income is per month.

{"body": "So, for my two cents. It's always important to learn the fundamentals. Stuff like woocommerce, drupal commerce, shopify will all implement similar approaches to the same thing: a list of products with some way of showcasing, selecting, safely taking payment, and collecting the appropriate customer information to deliver the product. Once you know how they're doing  you could build a similar approach with practically any technology stack if you put the time into learning the particulars. These tools are popular and very common because take most of the heavy lifting out of the picture, so you don't have to worry about coding complicated product search querys, secure login systems, faceted searches, image re-sizing, semantic markup, and so on. That can be laborious and difficult to manage (i.e. a lot of complex code) but as a webdev you should know enough about what's happening in the background so that it's not a total blackbox and if something breaks you have an idea of why. I would also get some practice with putting a site on a live-server and server configuration since you will have to do some of this for clients. A good tool for this is virtual box on your desk/laptop, or digital ocean has cheap VPS options\n\nI recommend schooling yourself up on the fundamentals of web design and development. It can be confusing because there are a lot of tools and a lot of different approaches to the same thing (php and php frameworks, css and css preprocessors, javascript and coffee script). You will learn about all of these as you hone your skills and your workflow will improve and change overtime. I recommend starting simple so you get the basics, from there it's all the same just with more bells and whistles. If you're already comfortable with Wordpress build a few AMP (Apache Mysql Php) sites so that you get familiar with the nuts and bolts of a database driven site. Try to implement the basic features that an e-shop has (log-in system, products catalog, catalog search, etc). I think you'll see pretty quickly that a homebrew approach can be fun, but a lot of work if you don't have experience managing a large codebase.  If you hacked together plugins and customized a theme you're off to a good start, you should be able to find plenty of free tutorials on the web-development basics. Doing e-commerce generally means being a full-stack developer, meaning you build the back and front-ends (i.e to design the catalog, you need to be able to make the catalog page), so this is why you need the whole picture. It sounds like your WP adventure got your feet wet.\n\nOnce you're comfortable, do some research into other e-commerce solutions (woocommerce, magento, drupal commerce, shopify) and pick a platform that plays to your strengths. From there, build a few sites for friend's or family-member's businesses, get a portfolio together and I think you'll have a good shot at a junior-dev position. There are also other aspects, but I think this is enough to start on the building it end. \n\nTLDR; 1) Nothing wrong with WP and woocommerce, but there are other tools and you should familiarize yourself with the range of options. Yes, there are many other ways to implement ecommerce solutions based on many different technologies.\n2) wireframing is a good design approach, but you can do the same thing in photoshop and a number of other design tools.

{"id": "d2ixfw5", "body": "*Starting up my own line, but I'll try to answer as many questions as I can for you.*\n\nhow do I get a hold of wholesale price blanks? Say I'm going with gildan hoodies and hanes tees. Do I need a wholesale account somewhere? If I can't do that as a low-price startup, what's the next cheapest way to get blanks?\n\n* Most wholesale distributors require you to have some sort of account set-up to access their wholesale pricelist, and this usually requires things such as a EIN number / other legal documents. If you are registering an actual business to do all of this, the set-up process for a wholesale account is worthwhile and can save you a lot of money. If you can't do this for any reason, most print shops that I have contacted have large amounts of blanks from all sorts of brands. However, if you are looking for a specific shirt color or style, it is always recommended to buy directly from the manufacturer as this is more economically sound. I personally do not purchase blanks from Aliexpress, but that is also an option if you are looking to outsource your manufacturing to a different country to save money.\n\nspeakin of those gildan hoodies and hanes tees, how should I go about removing tags? Will they be tagless wholesale? I know gildan 50/50 hoodies have a tag, is there a better way to get it out than to just cut it off w scissors? And don't hanes have a tag printed on the tee? I don't know if they're acceptable shown or not but I think it'd be most professional to have them taken off and have my own tag on.\n\n* Not sure if you can buy them without the tag, but you probably have to take them off yourself.\n\nWhat would be the best way to apply my own tag? I'm thinking not something that will itch like a bitch, I hate tags on the inside right side of a shirt or behind the neck. would the solution be printing it on? Is that feasible/inexpensive?\n\n* I am fortunate enough to have a screen printing company nearby me that can also attach hem tags to shirts. Printing inside the neckline is not very expensive, and the branding of your product can be very important later on - like other prices in the screen printing business, the more shirts you print, the less each shirt costs. \n\nMost my designs I came up with either have a graphic on the back or no graphic. I want to have a mini-logo on the left chest as many brands do. Is there a specific visually pleasing location for it to go here - a precise spot for the logo to be placed? Or am I just overthinking this one\nhow necessary is it to know how to sew? What opportunities does this skill open up for me?\n\n* Put your logos on that left pec, dude. There's no shame in that.\nDo you want to create more complicated pieces of clothing with your own cloth by hand? Learning sewing helps you understand how your clothing is constructed and you really want to know as much as you can about what you're dealing with. If you don't have someone that can attach hem tags for you, consider sewing them on.\n\nAre there any other feasible low-price startup items with pieces other than tee/hoodie/etc. blanks with designs on them? Like I'm interested in denim and trousers and shirts and outerwear and sneakers and accessories like socks/headbands/boxers/patches/backpacks, but getting those made is pricey - something I can only do if I take off and get something established, yay or nay?\n\n* Do I like socks? Yes. Do I like headbands? Yes. However, most start-up clothing brands only have tees, crewnecks, and hoodies because they're easier to print on. If you're dealing with pants or more complicated clothing pieces, you should look into cut &amp; sew. \n\nwebsite design - Should I just buy a nice template? And could I use a professional template in conjunction with something like bigcartel or whatever is the best site to sell clothes on?\n\n* A lot of people use Shopify because it's easy to use with it's website templates, included web-hosting, and various apps that you can use to better your branding. I am personally testing the waters with a small community of people within my city and then launching a website using Shopify. Other third-party services that offer 'online shops' include Squarespace, Bigcartel, Wordpress, etc. I would dig around and see what service suits your needs; \n\nShipping: How to ship for the lolo? I don't know how people do this. One time I went to the post office to try and return some clothes in one of those sealed bag packages and it was $13 to mail it. That ain't economical. How should clothes best be packaged? Some sort of protecting clear plastic stuff, and then into a package would be enough?\n\n* looking for this info too, though I'd talk to your local post office. \n\nWhen is the usual seasonal drop time? I want to launch this summer and I just wanna come up with a set of pieces and drop them a few at a time (this would be a...collection, correct?) Is there an optimal time to launch new stuff or anything?\n\n* I personally believe that an optimal time to drop your clothing is either - seasonally, semi-annually, or monthly. If you're creating a line for the spring, get all of your designs ready and have periodical drops weekly (like supreme) or every two weeks. You want your drops to be mostly consistent and have people wanting to wait until your clothing drops.\n\nwhat's a good quantity/size spread: I'm thinking 2 tees and 1-2 hoodies with color options, and 5/10/10/5 in each size for launch. Does that sound good?\n\n* I'm personally using the same size spread that you are (4/8/8/4), and I will be launching one hat, a couple shirts, and maybe something else. I would really try to diversify what you're putting out there just so that you can become more comfortable with those specific pieces of clothing in the future. \n\n\nI'd love to see what you come up with in the future.\n\nNetwork with me on Instagram [@TruceApparelCo]---LINK---", "subreddit": "streetwearstartup", "edited": 1461730270, "subreddit_id": "t5_2z6wn", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1461729662, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4glwss", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1463718473, "author": "TruceApparelCo", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_4glwss"}

{"id": "d2jmm1h", "body": "Hey what's up man,\n\nChecked out your site, social media, and product. Here is my take on it..\n\n1) Your market is definitely not \"small\", but I guess that's relative but I def. wouldn't consider it small. it's a pre-workout and because of your brand name \"HardCuts\" I think you can easily expand your line of products to like thermos and other supplements that can help you \"cut\"/shred, lose fat, etc. (not sure if that's what you were going for with the name but that's what I thought about when I saw it)\n\n2) supplements are all about branding. it's like energy drinks -- monster vs redbull the difference in revenue is mainly because of branding/positioning. It's not as effective running ads straight to a page selling a pre-workout (maybe thermos have a better shot because you can say it helps you lose weight, etc.) and I know Facebook specifically is tough on supplements and you have to be really careful if you are advertising supps with them.\n\n3) I really like your angle with your brand: transparent with your ingredients, and high quality ingredients. \n\n4) Since this is a branding play I would focus on getting fitness models, personal trainers, etc. (don't have to be famous, just have a decent/great following) and have them where apparel with your brand and post on instagram with your product and about your product and start building your brand/following. Best way is to copy a successful company like maybe ---LINK--- and look at their website and instragram, fb, etc. **I know they are using personal trainers to feed them sales, i.e. personal trainers/online fitness coaches usually recommend supplements.. so they have a discount code they give their clients and get a % of the sales from all the supplement their clients buy. (so reaching out to these people and giving them an extra way to make money from a great product and benefiting their clients is a win-win)\n\n5) My last note is that I would update your site. Maybe consider an e-commerce platform like Shopify. It's pretty easy to set up and should make everything look better and run smoother as you start to grow. I like your designs like your logo, product labels, etc. just think the layout of your site can be improved, but that's just my 2 cents and I think you should focus on the other things 1st.\n\nAlright hope this helped, let me know if you have any other questions!", "subreddit": "startups", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh26", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1461781149, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4goyz4", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 6, "ups": 6, "author": "divbase", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1463730488, "parent_id": "t1_d2jj8xl"}

Setting up an ecommerce site from scratch, competing in SEO may be more of a money/time suck. Whereas selling in a marketplace, may give you more bang for your buck. Alas, you asked about Wix v \"Other Stores\" and I'll give you my opinion. \n\n**Wix** is great for getting a single page site up and running for cheap. Their \"WYSIWYG\" is super easy to use, and you can get a site up in minutes. The downside is, they are sub-optimal in terms of SEO and overall site structure (in my experience). While they do maintain that they have workarounds, all the sites I've worked with have had issues with their URL structure, and the inclusion of things like /#!pagename/, being difficult to crawl. I don't know much about their ecommerce plugin. \n\n**Shopify** While maybe more expensive, they are built specifically for \"selling\" stuff, so that has an advantage. Some of their free templates are actually pretty good, with some minor tweaking and free plugins. They do have some SEO issues in terms of their robots.txt not being editable, and their focus on \"collections\" rather than product pages. But overall their default site structure right out of the box, is pretty good. Their inventory management and how you create products, is very tight. Plus they have free plugins that allow you to sell on Facebook and Pinterest, which is probably in your target market. \n\nBest of luck!

Like tastefully including whatever keywords are hot for traveling skateboarders who are looking for boards like yours. This is one hot reason companies have blogs, but if you don't have the desire to do one or don't feel there is enough content then it's best to steer clear, a forced blog doesn't do much good.\n\nAlso, I thought when I clicked on a board, say the Black Japan, that I'd be taken to a page or one would pop up with more info, details etc. Maybe even a repeat of much of what is at the top, since since users will scroll past all the info and won't be looking at the board they want and the info at the same time. Adding something like this if Shopify allows would provide visitors with information and communicate the value of these nice boards--and, would be another good place to use keywords people looking for a product like yours are using.\n\nAlso (haha I said I didn't have anything to say, still something minor) maybe placing the Add to Cart buttons under each board or something? The single button with the selector for all the boards might not be apparent to everyone.

{"body": "Hey, Shopify app developer here.  As /u/dpash said, apps are basically just third party websites that have access to your store once you give them permission. \n\nWhen you \"install\" an app, you are really just giving that app permission to access your store through shopify's API. In simple terms, an API allows two applications two talk to each other, so in this case, the third-party app can talk to your shopify store. You can revoke this permission (uninstall) the app at any time and the app will no longer have access to your store. \n\nIn terms of how much you can trust these apps there are two basic concepts. The first one is user reviews, if the app has glowing reviews then it's a pretty safe bet that the app will not harm your store in any way. If an app has a lot of negative reviews, then you might want to stay away. Please note though that pretty much all apps will have at least 1 negative review, you can't make everyone happy :)\n\nThe second thing to look for is on the install page itself. It will tell you exactly what type of access the app is looking to have for your store (i.e. updating products or reading customer information). Only install the app if you are comfortable giving a third-party access to the information they are asking for. Again, if they have really good reviews on the shopify app store, it's a pretty safe bet that you can trust them but at the end of the day it is up to your comfortability level.\n\nIn terms of how the app will look it depends on the app. Some apps will simply redirect you to their website to use and some will appear within the shopify admin itself. Both operate in mostly the same way but I personally find the apps in the admin more convenient to use.\n\nFinally, I can only speak for myself here but as an app developer I have no interested in messing up your store. In fact, what is good for you is good for me (more installs). I know that the better I serve my customers, the better reviews and the more revenue I should receive. That and I try to be a decent person in general :)\n\nHopefully that helps but if you have any other questions i'm happy to answer them. \n\n", "id": "d2m0fdv", "subreddit": "shopify", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sn78", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1461935584, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4gyw8h", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1463771532, "author": "mehphp", "edited": false, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_4gyw8h"}

{"body": "This is one of those tremendous questions that I wish people would discuss daily.  Instead it comes up next to never.\n\nThe problem with advertising within the platform is that you would only have access to an already small pool of clients.  Your best hope is that the platform will grow to be big enough, but you don't get to drive that growth.  So you would be paying to be a big fish in a small pond.\n\nIf you already have an online presence, then it makes sense to offer shopping through OB as an alternative.  If you have a shopify website, you might pay 2% to them &amp; 3% to PayPal/Stripe/whoever. OB is free &amp; a bitcoin wallet takes ~1% to convert to fiat currency.  On a $500 order, the difference is about $20.  Offering a customer the chance to save an additional $20 if they buy through OB increases the odds of getting them onto the marketplace.  Though honestly it does more for OB than it does for you since the transaction is the same.  Unless you have recurring, high ticket orders, it's a wash.\n\nIt seems like an unsolvable problem until OB pivots.  Either by charging a fee that goes into marketing the platform or by offering a front end website that works as a window to OB.
