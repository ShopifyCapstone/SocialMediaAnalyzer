{"body": "I have etsy shop and also just launched my own website last week [gemgemrock]---LINK--- ) by shopify. It was also hard for me to decided where to build my own site but I decided to try shopify. I found shopify very easy to use (at this point)...but I am not gonna lie, I thought its bit confusing at first couple days..But shopify has a help support number and I simply made phone calls whenever I couldnt figure out something...I even called shopify support for small things like how to add products..yeah its very basic I know haha( Im pretty sure many of you can find those information easily but I couldnt lol)  but shopify support agents were super nice and helpful..:) \n\nI also like their free themes...I am currently using free theme called \"boundless \" for my shop...you can find the demo website at shopify theme store and also you can compare it to my website....boundless demo website looks really cool but I think mine is bit girly because I used pink color etc ..anyways my point is you can still create unique website by their free theme..there are other free themes as well and you can change your theme anytime( also you can purchase one)\n\nanother thing I love about shopify is you can learn more details of your daily traffic..I know you can learn that as well on etsy but shopify provides great details such as \"how many people added your products to their cart( which products)\", \" how many people reached to check out section but didnt purchase\"...etc.\n\nBut one negative thing about own website is you have to work really really hard to get more traffic to your website. I get nearly 1000 views daily and I have daily sales on etsy. But with my own website that I just launched last week, I had 2 sales at this point but I only have  7 to 10 visitors daily...:(haha I am still working on my website to make it better but 1000 views  on etsy vs 10 views are huge difference :) \n\n\nFor the domain...I purchased my domain at namecheap.com so I didnt purchase my domain at shopify. On shop admin section of your shopify account, there is section to add your domain name..so I simply added my domain name there but I got confused about how to redirect my shopify website URL to my domain name purchased from namecheap.com. So I did live chat with namecheap live support agent and he helped me out perfectly. \n\nI hope those information was useful and I wish you the best :) these are only my experience so you might have much more traffic right after you launch your website who knows ;) \n\nanyways good luck!!! :D\n\n", "id": "d3s38dg", "subreddit": "Etsy", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq24", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1464807629, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4lwbfq", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "MoonCat000", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1468743388, "parent_id": "t3_4lwbfq"}

However, I envision a two-tier level of customization with the \"ultimate\" Shopify theme (and framework).  The back-end would consist of modules, libraries, and extensive documentation for web assemblers to toggle features on/off in the Theme Customizer for the end client.  The Theme Customizer itself would be customized via the schema to reflect the specific needs of any particular template/client/niche.\n\nShopify artificially limits features of it's free themes, in order to promote the premium ones.

And yeah I can shed some light lol\n\nYou dont arrange a drop-shipping platform with the merchant on Ali express.\nYou start a store somewhere &gt; List products exactly like your Ali express merchant (images and descriptions , modified title) &gt; You make sales in your site &gt; You take that money and buyers address &gt; give it to aliexpress merchant. &gt; He ships to the buyer.\n\nYou don't have to make any ARRANGEMENTS with the seller if you are just starting. You can make a deal with merchant once you do more volume. \nThe only thing I used to do is , asked the seller to remove his branding and put mine. Aliexpress merchants know about droshipping and they are happy to help (most of them)\n\n\n2. I am a programmer , and I setup my own store with Magento eCommerce platform and I integrated a payment system.\nEven if you are a non programmer you can outsource this task , there are tons of people out there who can do the job for you.\n\nBut for starters  I would recommend Shopify .. Shopify makes it very easy to setup store and handle all the orders and even help you managing payments . For starters you are skipping a boatload of headaches using shopify. \nI didn't want to give shopify anything and I wanted to try something new too. So I setup my own using Magento ( which is very very powerful platform btw)\n\n3. The main challenge I faced was .. the refund requests. \nAli express sellers were slow at that time. People become frustrated and come to me for refunds. But now I think they have increased the speed. you may want to check on that.\nFor most of the people , the problem would be  \"GETTING BUYERS\"\nwell that too was a problem but once you learn to laser target your people , draw in customers from social media using many tricks its all good. I am a programmer , an internet marketer too so this part was really fun for me and I got really good knowledge.\n\n\n4. I never touched brands. I don't know much about branding. All I cared was about making profits. So I went for specific niche products ( non branded ) . I am looking forward to get information about this whole brand thing in this thread. Wish someone would be happy to share that.\n\n\n5. According to me Ali express is the best place to start. The are good , sellers are good and has a good refund policy. If your business attains volume you can use Alibaba to contact factory directly and make a contract .. This will reduce your price per item which means more $profit$\n\n\nOne more thing I did was , my business was medium sized and I didn't have time for order fulfillment \nyou know taking the address of buyers , making orders at aliexpress .. the whole thing was too much work for me. because I do lot of stuff.\nThus I hired a Filipino Virtual Assistant from a site and he was efficient and really good at work. He did his work and at the end of the day I just go and pay for everything in the cart.\nLeaving it here for lazy people like me.\n\nGood Luck mate. ;)", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": 1465015256, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1465015056, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4meq4j", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1468800796, "author": "abyabraham", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_4meq4j"}

Go back 20 years, small batch manufacturing was HARD and EXPENSIVE. The cost to make one of something wasn't that much different than the cost to make 100 of something. Now if you want to make 100 of something, it is as cheep as making 1000 of them. \n\nI can buy a mill for less than 130k (the cost of low end 18 wheeler truck cab) that has a level of precision and repeatability that is only matched by the most skilled of machinists. If you don't need that level of quality, you can get away with spending a few thousand, less than the cost of a new car. If I need plastics I can buy a 3d printer in the $300-400 range that can make plastic parts. \n\nI can buy off the shelf electronic components, that were only fantasy 10 years ago, batteries, that can power them for months at a time, and connectivity to send and receive information. \n\nGot an idea, fund on kickstarter, need to promote, your not buying time on TV or radio but using social media,  want to process credit cards, or have an online store, Stripe and Shopify have you covered.

{"body": "First, let's make sure you understand what you're asking us to help you with.  What is Organic Traffic?\n\nIf you answer - people who come to my site without me paying for it, then good luck, we can't really help you.\n\nIf you answer - the culmination of establishing my domain as the definitive destination for particular information and/or product, then congratulations, you're on the right path and the advice below could help you.\n\nDefining Organic Traffic as the *culmination* is in line with reality - you can't just \"pay\" or \"work\" and get Organic Traffic.  Instead, you \"pay\" or \"work\" to achieve small accomplishments that, when combined, result in Organic Traffic.\n\nYou have a marketing budget.  You told /u/jcpeden that you're dumping money into PPC so obviously there is a budget.  A brief aside - I'm sorry to hear your description of your PPC spend.  PPC often plays an important role in different marketing strategies (even strategies looking to build organic traffic).  Although you might be overspending, I certainly hope you're not \"dumping\" money into it.  But this post is not about PPC, so let's move on.\n\nRecap - Organic Traffic is the result of your site becoming a recognized destination to go to for particular information and/or product.  So \"how to build organic traffic\" is really asking what are some things you can invest your money/time into accomplishing, that when combined with each other, will result in Organic Traffic?\n\nHere are the 4 areas you should invest in: Search, Content, Social, Relationships.  \n\n**Search**\n\n*On page SEO*.  Yes, it's old news.  Yes, much of the advice online isn't even important to Search Engine's anymore.  Yes, if your site is built on popular platforms like Magento, WordPress, Shopify, etc. there are tools that can automate much, if not all, of this work.  And yet so many businesses don't even know this is a thing!  Do you have any idea how many sites lack alt tags on their images? Or use images as their page titles? Or my personal favorite, use javascript to link within the site?  In the world of online marketing, On Page SEO is fundamentals.  To put it in basketball terms, your fancy cross over ain't worth shit if you end up missing the lay up.  Without on page SEO, all your other work can be undone.\n\nTo be fair, there are definitely more advanced tactics to on-page SEO such as strong internal linking, manipulating external link and page associations, raising or lowering link placement, manipulating social signals and page associations, manipulating page keywords, regularly scheduled review of back links (and removal as needed), and I'm probably forgetting plenty.  While these are all helpful, they're not necessary - at least not yet.  These can make the difference between ranking 3rd and ranking 1st, to be sure - but first let's get you to 3rd from 131st and then we'll worry about these.\n\n*Track your Keyword rankings.*  Duh.  But seriously, most businesses don't.  It's actually depressing how many don't.  There are plenty of great and not so great SEO blogs.  Pick the ones you like and be sure to stay up to date.  Equally important is understanding how to use your analytics and get easy-to-read reports.  The same blog advice applies.  There are great Google scripts to help you automate this.  There are 3rd party services that offer this as well.  Buyer beware.  Do your homework.\n\n*Build back links*. Again, duh.  And again, most businesses don't do this.  There are so many back link building strategies out there.  None of them are the be-all end all solution.  Read up on different strategies.  Evaluate your team's technical skill set, your budget, your available time, etc.  Pick a strategy that you feel comfortable with and implement it.  If you have the time/budget/resources, pick another back link building strategy, and implement that one as well.  Rinse/repeat until you don't have the time/budget/resources for adding another back linking strategy to your current business.  Back linking is not a one time thing.  It's on going.  It never stops.  It never ends.  Remember to go back periodically and evaluate if you now have the time/budget/resources to implement another back link building strategy.\n\n\n**Content**\n\n*Videos*.  If you don't, you're an idiot.  Every topic and every product could benefit in some way, shape, or form from a video.  How to use it.  Famous people who've done it.  It's place in modern society.  Which movies embraced it.  Blah blah blah.  Video is cheap.  Video is entertaining.  Most importantly, video is effective.  But wait, it's effective at what?  Glad you asked.  It's effective at producing interaction.  Say what you want about the YouTube comment army, they interact.  I'm not saying you should troll them and purposely illicit negative comments, but the conversation that ensues could help foster even more conversation and that is the spark you need to ignite recognition.\n\n*Articles/Infographics*. I grouped these together because these are not different from a marketing perspective.  The point of both is to offer something so insightful and so useful that others are compelled to share it and (hopefully) give you credit.\n\nNOTE: There is a plethora of online resources to help you create both videos and info graphics and even to create them for you.  Again, buyer beware, but with some homework and diligence, you can find great partners.  I've personally not had as much success when it comes to article writing, but others have.  Just do your homework.\n\n**Social Media**\n\n*Track your social media community size.*  This is pretty obvious.  The more people that engage with your brand on particular information and/or product, the more others will recognize your brand as a source for that particular information and/or product.  But don't be stupid.  3,000 Facebook likes is not better than 1,000 Facebook likes and 1,200 Twitter followers is not better than 240 Twitter followers.  A Like or a Follower are in and of themselves useless to you.  You need to track Likes and Followers that are active, and even more importantly, active with your brand.  Don't just copy/paste the number of Likes into a Powerpoint and say \"look how much we grew on social media!\" because that's just silliness.  Instead, be vigilant when you're on social media and identify users that actively respond, re-post/re-tweet, or engage in some meaningful way.  Track the growth of *these* types of users.  What's the ideal ratio of *active*:non-active followers/Likes?  I don't know, it's different for different verticals.  However, if you have 3,000 followers but only 12 are active, it's safe to assume you're not reaching anyone regardless of how often you post.\n\n*Manipulate your social media engagement.*  My peers usually tell clients that they should \"Manage\" the social media engagement.  I specifically say \"Manipulate\" instead because clients just zombie-nod when they're told to \"manage\" something.  When we tell you to \"manage\" the engagement, what we're actually saying is that you should be meticulous in choosing your words and crafting your messages in a way that achieves a sought-after goal.  Real life example - most business owners \"manage\" social media with a post boasting the merits of their newest widget.  What the consultant actually means, however, is for your post to question if the widget you just released is useful at all and hopefully spark a conversation.  Is that \"managing\" or \"manipulating\"? Who cares, whatever gets the conversation going.\n\n**Relationships**\n\n*Blog Outreach*. The PR of the online world.  I hate the way most businesses do this, but I get it.  Find bloggers that talk about the information and/or product you want your site to be the destination for.  Spam them and hopefully a few respond and either write posts that mention your site or let you write a guest post that mentions your site.  Meh.\n\nThe far better approach, although the far more expensive one as well, is for you to go follow the bloggers that talk about information and/or product that you want your site to be a destination for.  Get to know the bloggers by reading their blog.  Comment on their blog.  Participate in the conversation.  Establish yourself as a knowledgeable member of their community.  Always be positive, always encourage debate (that's fuel for bloggers), and always make yourself available for questions.  Much in the way your site earns Organic Traffic by being a destination, you will get opportunities to be part of bloggers' posts and even guest post if you establish yourself as a knowledgeable and active member in different communities.\n\n*Events/Conferences*.  Attend them.  If you're in business to do or sell something, surround yourself with people that do it better or sell more of it.  Your competitors can potentially be your ticket to growth.  Interact with them.  Learn from them.  Implement what you learn.  Improve it.  Rinse/repeat until they're learning from you.  Congratulations, you've become the expert and it's safe to assume your site is either the authority on particular information and/or product, or it's on it's way to being so.", "id": "d3ym4sh", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1465249051, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4mu3sp", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "ups": 3, "author": "InsiderT", "edited": 1465249615, "retrieved_on": 1468855908, "parent_id": "t3_4mu3sp"}

{"body": "Thanks for the thorough response and insight. It's much appreciated! I'm definitely getting caught up in minutia that isn't productive, especially since I'm starting from nothing.\n\n&gt; Even when you have a logo and some designs, it really isn't a 'brand' until people are buying your products and you're making money - it certainly isn't a business. You can start a new brand anytime you like.\n\nHaha\u2026man, I always have to remind myself that no one really cares but me. I actually spent the weekend comping up logos, hacking away at wordpress templates, researching plugins and services etc\u2014all while **not** designing any shirts. The tendency for design circlejerking is very strong. But I recognize I need to get over this _design perfectionism_ if I ever expect to make a sale. The dumb thing though, as a designer myself, it's very easy for me to get going at work and refine as I go.\n\nSo yes, first-things-first, get validation; worry about everything else later.\n\n&gt; Final point: of the 3 places you list you want to sell on, only one has any kind of 'already provided' traffic (Cotton Bureau).\n\n**Great, I'm definitely going to submit a design that way. Without seeing samples or grabbing a shirt from there myself, it seems that through quick google searches they have the least negative reviews.**\n\nFor some reason though, I'm stuck on the idea of wanting to sell on Cotton Bureau and Printful + Shopify. I don't know why I have adverse feelings towards places like Redbubble, Society6, etc.\n\n&gt; The other 2 are not going to deliver customers to your door - you're going to have to drive traffic with your own marketing efforts. If you already have a fan base or other type of 'list' you can tap into then great, otherwise you are going to have a real hard time getting any sales via those platforms to begin with.\n\n**I practically have no online presence beyond my reddit account so I have no fans / list to leverage**. To get over this and offer some value, I was thinking about investing in vinyl stickers. They're low cost and something I'd be willing to eat. I would offer them in exchange for the price of shipping and sign up for my newsletter.\n\nAlso, I understand that credibility and giving is important. After all, I find myself supporting people and businesses that actively give back to their communities\u2014whether with free stuff or content. Assuming my stickers are something people want, I figure they'd be a low cost item that could be neat. Something I can share. Just posting pictures of my art / design doesn't seem good enough for me.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n----\n\nSo all in all:\n\nMy best bet is to start selling on platforms with an existing audience since I'd have to spend a considerable amount of effort / time otherwise. Once **and only** if sales start rolling in, consider opening my own store to drive traffic to. **Do you have any advice about the platforms you mentioned in terms of shirts?**\n\nMy sense is that I shouldn't be thinking too far beyond that. Since I have nothing to market, then thinking about marketing / driving traffic is kind of useless. Make things first, then share.\n\n---\n\nAgain, thank you for the advice and your Aura profile.

{"id": "d40dpm4", "body": "Many people want to start up their own business and import, but don't know what's the next step? As per my 6 years custom plastic injection molding international sales experience(rpimoulding), below are the general steps:\n\n1, Do some basic research of the products you need to import: Is it worth importing?( if hollow inside but not stackable,  and takes too much space for the shipping, not suggested to import)  Is it my favorite?(Only if you like it, you can stick with it)\n\n2, Try to know what and how the products are made of? Whether a tooling/mold should be applied. How to get different pattern or color. No matter whatever you will do, be more professional.\n\n3, Find what you decide to go for, and get quotes from several companies, not only to compare the price, but also to discuss more in the future to decide whom you will move forward with.\n\n4, Ask customer references from the suppliers, and check their honesty. Scammers can be found everywhere, not only in China, so being careful is better. If they are real companies, their export records can be found by google, such as: portexaminder, tradesparq, tradesns, panjiva, importgenius,\netc.\n\n5, Ask for a PO/PI with all the details, including trade terms, payment terms, quantities, prices, etc.\n\n6, Pay the deposit, better not to pay 100% in advance.\n\n7, Ask for samples before mass production, to double check the quality and assembling,etc.\n\n8, During the manufacturing, you can let the manufacturer estimate the packing, including carton size, how many pcs/carton, gross weight per carton, how many cartons totally. Then you can check which way is the most cost-effective for you: by courier like DHL? or by air? or by sea. If by courier, it is easy.\n\n9, If by air or by sea, you need to find several forwarders or ask the manufaturer's forwarder to quote for the shipping.  Also, remember to check their honesty. You need to let them know how and where you would like to ship: To door?or to air/sea port? Which sea/air port?  What's the shipping address, and what's the consignee/notify party's  information. Usually the consignee is the same as the notify party. But if you do not want your goods be shipped to you but to your customer, you can have your company as the consignee, and have your customer's company as the notify party. \n\n10, Prepare to find a local Customs broker to clear the Customs for you, otherwise, you can not pick up the goods. \nNote: if you are American, remember to let them file the ISF for you, or you will be fined about 5000USD. Some forwarders can do it and some brokers can also do it. Ask them, and officially notify them to file the ISF for you within 48 hours before the vessel leaves the loading port. \n\n11, Let the manufacturer contact your decided forwarder to transport the goods to the loading port's warehouse.\n\n12, Let the forwarder notify you when the vessel leaves, and the ETA.\n\n13, When the goods arrive at the sea/air port, your appointed Customs broker should clear the Customs for you, and then you can arrange the pick-up. If quoted to door, you can ignore this step.\n\nIf your trade terms with the manufacturer is balance paid before shipment, the balance payment should be done before NO.11; if balance paid as per copy of B/L, the balance payment should be done between NO.11 and NO.13, but before NO. 13, in case your goods can not be Customs cleared that extra demurrage fee will be charged.", "subreddit": "shopify", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sn78", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1465354981, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4n1owj", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "ups": 3, "author": "chinamoldmaker", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1468886311, "parent_id": "t3_4n1owj"}

I don't know why I have adverse feelings towards places like Redbubble, Society6, etc.\n\nprobably because you have limited control over your work and how it appears on redbubble, soc6 etc. Which is fine, but ask yourself this: would I rather make $0/month and be super-proud of my brand and website, or make $100/month and feel kind of un-proud of your 'brand'?\n\nRelatively speaking, the amount of time and effort (and money) you'll have to put in to get returns on redbubble vs. your own site - is nothing. Long term, your own site is definitely the way to go - but you need to realise this is like *years*, not months. Building a fan base, a trusted brand and return customers that generate regular, decent monthly income, is going to take like at least 2 years, assuming you're starting from nothing. Meanwhile, throughout those 2 years, you can be making regular decent income from redbubble, soc6 etc.\n\n&gt;  To get over this and offer some value, I was thinking about investing in vinyl stickers. They're low cost and something I'd be willing to eat. I would offer them in exchange for the price of shipping and sign up for my newsletter.\nAlso, I understand that credibility and giving is important. After all, I find myself supporting people and businesses that actively give back to their communities\u2014whether with free stuff or content. Assuming my stickers are something people want, I figure they'd be a low cost item that could be neat. Something I can share. Just posting pictures of my art / design doesn't seem good enough for me.\nAny thoughts?\n\nI actually bought 1k stickers from China when I started about 3 years ago. I still have at least 500 in my drawer under my desk. I'm not saying this is a bad idea, but just be realistic about what you're going to get back from stickers. They work well as giveaways for little competitions on instagram or something, but they are unlikely to be products people want. Personally I would focus your attention on your core products and sales/marketing strategies, rather than the 'sprinkles' which is all stickers really are. \n\n&gt; My best bet is to start selling on platforms with an existing audience since I'd have to spend a considerable amount of effort / time otherwise. Once and only if sales start rolling in, consider opening my own store to drive traffic to. Do you have any advice about the platforms you mentioned in terms of shirts?\n\nStart with Redbubble and [Teepublic]---LINK---, those two bring in the most for me. Then DesignbyHumans, then soc6. No point doing teespring or anything like that, no organic traffic. \n\nIf you can get setup on Etsy then that would be my next best step, using [printful]---LINK--- or [printaura]---LINK--- for fulfilment.

You're selling wood products, make people remember that. Something like \"GotWood\", \"WoodsNStuff\", \"Woodn\" if you want to be hipster. At least have the name describe what you sell. -- If for whatever reason you're hell bent on keeping Regular fit then at least buy regularfit.com as it's expiring soon.\n\nThe website isn't too bad. I would change shipping times to 3-4 weeks, personally I use 2 to 2 months. It's better to deliver more than the buyer expects (early delivery) than have expectations you can't meet (late delivery). If the buyer wants the stuff now they would be using Amazon Prime, if they're buying from you chances are they don't care if it takes long if you're honest with them.\n\nIf you start getting sales, think about getting another theme. You got the basic free Shopify one and it screams dropshipper. Install Google Analytics, it doesn't look like you're using that and you'll want the metrics when you advertise. I'd remove the top bar, not because it shouldn't be there, but the top left icon makes people leave your website. Usually that's where people expect to find YOUR logo and if they click it they should go to your home page... not an external website. And think about accepting more than PayPal, the more payment options someone has the better.

Most people are just pretty clueless about the actual address as long as the page looks the same.\n\nOther little facts:\n\n* Shopify support has been amazing.\n* Shopify abandoned cart notifications are awesome.\n* The Shopify userbase is enormous, so it\u2019s really easy to find advice and answers from people that know.\n\nIf you have any other questions just post them here or PM me.

{"body": "&gt;Hey guys/gals,\nI've been working with a Web Designer I'm not at all happy with on a Shopify site I need to launch ASAP, preferably by the end of this weekend if not sooner. Current designer appears to be bad all around (art direction, coding, you name it), and to boot even seems to have a very full book so I feel like I'm being left by the wayside while they pursue bigger and better things. I'm checking here (business partner's advice) to see if anyone might be able to help me given my current quandary. I'm looking for someone U.S. based (or speaks fluent English) with a proven track record (portfolio), has time now, well versed in Shopify code, can stick to my timeline, and does not have a problem conversing over the phone or Skype about things, cares about customers, the whole nine. We're talking a small apparel site (sensitive ideas, need to remain confidential) with 9 designs over seven products. Got some sites I'd like to pattern after but need something tailored to my brand without being over the top. Simple. Please get in touch, I look forward to hearing from you! If I don't get to all of you I will make it a point to mention my status in the comments. Thanks!\nC\n\nHi C,\n\nThe first thing I notice here is that your designer seems to be the same person as your developer. Are they equipped to do both things?  (Sounds like they aren't)\n\nI recently had an ecommerce client. I accepted a job with them to build an MVP of their shop.\n\nThe client never got their photography together, never got their designer to send me any comps of the pages, and essentially expected me to build a site without any business or art guidance. \n\nNow, I am a developer but I have a good understanding of design, so I offered to slap BASIC Bootstrap UX onto their site until they got their design together.  This never happened.\n\nFast forward to last month: the client called me demanding the site be delivered by the following week.  They had given me some hint that they wanted to get it delivered in the next few weeks but failed to provide me with any additional photography, business logic, or design.\n\nNow, as a result I am mad at this client, the client clearly expects something from me that I never offered. The client doesn't have what they needed for their business because they failed to give me what I asked for and I am not able to end the relationship on a positive note which is a huge issue for me.  This is a key thing, I want to do the right thing because my business thrives on referrals. So if they can't refer me, this is a lose-lose situation. But I can't make a website out of nothing, either.\n\nAll this said, you can see how a project can get out of control.  Now I know I have never worked with you and perhaps you are feeling frustrated with your designer right now, but it may be that they are feeling the same about you.\n\nI would recommend you reach out to this person and ask \"what are the things you need from me that I have failed to give you\".  This humble approach could repair the relationship and maybe help you swiftly end this project on a positive note.\n\nIf you need an ongoing Shopify developer, I am happy to help, please PM me if this is the case.\n\nEdit: By the way, this story is told in the present tense but the project has been completed per the original specifications. I refused to give the client additional things they asked to have for free. You wouldn't give away a stereo, why do people expect extra functionality in their websites for free? We unfortunately parted ways for good. The client is now struggling with cheaper out-of-country developers and the project is going very poorly for them. I want so badly to step in and offer guidance, but I've spend SO much time on them, and that relationship had to end for my consultancy to be able to function.", "id": "d44blla", "subreddit": "forhire", "edited": 1465604729, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzbh", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1465603304, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4ncpc2", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "ups": 3, "author": "sphere_is_so_cool", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1468954393, "parent_id": "t3_4ncpc2"}

So at the price point Shopify offers, it definitely wins when it comes to 'Costing' (ps it should be Cost) on its own.\n\nYou've also got the cost of getting it set up. It might be hard to remember, but setting up your own WordPress install \u2013 nevermind Woocommerce on top of it \u2013 is difficult if you've never set up a website before (which is who I assume you're targeting this infographic at).\n\n\n**Customisation**\n\nAgain, on the assumption this infographic is aimed at shop owners rather than web specialists, then it being open source counts for very little. They'll still need to pay someone to customise it beyond what it does out the box. And I'd bet my right leg anyone claiming to be a Shopify developer knows what they're doing, unlike a huge percentage of \"WordPress Experts\".\n\n\n**Performance**\n\nBased on what? The agency I work for has Magento, WordPress, Drupal, OpenCart and Shopify sites that all turn over \u00a31m a year in revenue. The two that are hardest to scale are WordPress and OpenCart. Shopify actually outperforms some of our Magento sites too. Hell, you even contradict this point in the following one, Product.\n\n\n**FTP Access**\n\nWrong. It does have FTP access, it's just not directly accessible (which is a good thing from a security standpoint \u2013 especially when we're talking about an ecom site). Any developer worth their salt (which is the only group that would really need FTP access) would be able to deal with this. Otherewise, it's a completely irrelevant point for non-web specialists.", "id": "d44p474", "subreddit": "Wordpress", "edited": 1465640988, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhjq", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1465633222, "author_flair_text": "Developer", "link_id": "t3_4nkcw2", "author_flair_css_class": "wplogo-blue", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1468960843, "author": "frontendben", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_4nkcw2"}

{"body": "Two words: No Fear\n\nInvestment? $200-$300, more people spend that on the lottery in a year in my country. Build your own website or use a free platform - now you're saving $360+ a year compared to using platforms like Shopify. Your costs could be as low as $20 a year for a domain if you have free hosting. Disclaimer: Shopify and others are great when you don't have the technical skills.\n\nNeed Experience? Every entrepreneur has to start somewhere, no biggie. The only workshop you need as a store, then read everything you can. eCommerce Fuel is a great podcast. Shopify has lots of good articles on getting started.\n\nIt all sounds too scary? Just start with one product then. Do low margin drop shipping and skip inventory altogether. Make a one page website only. Don't sweat over pricing - A convenience store charges more for the convenience - There are people that regularly sell items on eBay that are 2, 3 times more priced then others selling on eBay because the most expensive is faster, or better for some other reason. You can literally profit by being patient. \n(Tip: Don't even buy the products. Place a few items that you will buy if the sales goes through, tell the customer it will be 2-3 weeks and shit you not most people will wait.\n\nAlibaba is an okay place to start, and yes scam happen but not as much as you'd think. The above example could have people buying from eBay and then selling on eBay, so really can buy from any where. People buy from retail stores and sell online, there's so many variants. I would suggest getting a sample from Alibaba before ordering more and work your quantities up. With aliexpress you can buy just one quality to see if it's any good. (When you get more comfortable you can advance by buying direct from manufacturers, sell wholesale, develop your own products and make your own brands). \n\nTips:\nA website made today, placed online with zero marketing takes up to a year to get a sale. Create content (webpages, articles, videos, info-graphics, more websites) or create a community (social, blog, etc) to grow. Buy ads for immediate sales, if you spend X amount of dollars and make less in profit, it's probably not the best campaign unless customers are coming back for consumables or a subscription. \n\n", "id": "d44wdzf", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1465656221, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4nl9e4", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "ups": 2, "author": "drawvr", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1468964291, "parent_id": "t3_4nl9e4"}

There have been a lot of positive developments over the past decade or so. There are more and more ambitious startups in the region. A lot of Toronto-natives who left for the SF Bay Area are returning to the city and bringing with them extremely valuable experiences. \n\nIn addition, local companies appear to be doing a better job of retaining local talent. I know several individuals who had offers from a couple of SF startups, but ultimately decided to stay in Toronto and accept offers from companies like Shopify because salaries are now more competitive. In addition, once you account for housing prices in SF, the difference in pay between the two cities is not that large. As a result, not only are Toronto companies retaining more talent, they also appear to be doing a better job attracting talents from elsewhere, especially from places like Vancouver and Calgary. \n\nObviously Toronto is not even close to the vaunted \"Silicon Valley.\" Nor is it at the same level as some other cities like Seattle, NYC or Boston.

Your Shopify theme is really basic and it communicates that you're a new store.  I put would move \"Log in  or  Create account\" in the footer and move the Cart link to the Navigation bar.  This will give you much less whitespace at the top and push the logo to the top of the page.  Remove the FaceBook and Instagram links in the footer until you have some kind of follower base. Add some content to the home page that describes your mission.  Add a \"Featured Product\" heading to the product on the home page.  \n\n2. The descriptions of the t-shirts could be improved. Check out some white t-shirt product pages from MR PORTER: ---LINK---, ---LINK---\n\n3. The images of the t-shirts look computer generated. Would be better if they looked more realistic/were photographed professionally. \n\n4. There needs to be more aspirational content about turbos so that the person feels like when they buy the t-shirt they are also buying into your message. \n\n5. No contact us page. Users feel more confident purchasing if there is contact information in the footer (address, tel, email etc) and a contact us page.  \n\n6. Low followers on instagram/facebook.  I would recommend you reach out to key influencers in your niche and see if they will wear the t-shirt and post about it (linking your instagram page).  Re-gram them and also post to facebook photos. In the meantime invite all your friends to like your facebook page and follow all your friends on instagram - some will follow back. \n\nThere is so much more you can do.

You will need to hire someone or do it yourself.  \nFor an example of why apps will not work:  \nASP.NET Storefront (at least our store) does not contain any data for variant options. So instead of importing 1,500 products with about 30,000 skus, you would get 30,000 separate products.

Costs vary month to month.\n\n* Find your smallest lightest product and start with that, size not that important unless its actually huge, like 2-5 ft in size in any dimension huge\n\n* Weight is the most expensive factor try staying under 1lb.\n\n* Boxes+packing material shouldn't exceed $1 even in small quantities.  Custom boxes are really overblown, I can't believe people are paying $2-$3 per custom box.  Get a regular box and put a stamp (as in rubber stamp, not a sticker) on it - thats good enough for 90% of people.\n\n* Shipping is best done through stamps.com + shipstation.com + a thermal 4x6 printer.  Stamps gets you solid cheaper shipping rates (up to 50% less than standard usps).  Shipstation.com aggregates all your ecommerce outlets and pushes the result to stamps.  The printer is around $200 and will do prepaid postage and address.  Stamps can contact usps to do a pickup at your place of business.\n\nThat's pretty much it.

{"body": "\"A lot of your traffic goes to waste.\" I don't actually agree with this for the reasons you mentioned. You should NEVER depend on the site you're on 100% for your search ability. I use all forms of social media (twitter, tumblr, DA, IG, FB, Reddit, etc) to not only get my Etsy search up, but to do Google at the same time - which is basically what you said under \"It could be hard to gain traffic when you launch your shop.\"\n\nAgain, you should never 100% depend on ANY search function without doing leg work yourself.\n\nI'm sorry to nit pick, but I also have to disagree with this line, \"When you visit an Etsy store you can easily go to another Etsy store which sells related products to yours.\" that's not an Etsy exclusive problem. Everyone has access to a web bar where they can search key words. I, for a fact, always search multiple places before choosing an item I buy online and I base it on many different criteria - criteria which I believe all online shoppers stand by, which is why I continue to have faith in my store, because I apply those criteria there, too. Yeah, people may sell similar things to you on Etsy, but so do SO MANY other sites too that people can easily google.\n\nIf Shopify works better for you than Etsy did, that's wonderful and I hope it continues to go well. I just wanted to point out how I felt and my own thoughts on the matter.\n\nEDIT: I would also like to add that while sometimes I grumble over Etsy % they get from my sales, it seems so much more minor compared to what Shopify would charge me every month. I am disabled, I depend on my Etsy to help make ends meet and the Shopify fee is just... not possible. Also, I'm not sure where Shopify comes in to play in regards to shipping, but unless it's similar to the discount Etsy gives me for printing my labels at home, I'm even less interested.

Many of these companies (Snake Head Vintage comes to mind) have a website and also sell on Etsy, Handmade Amazon, and eBay. After I finish my own website, I'll have all 4 rolling too. Having more instances and syndications of your brand actually *enhances* it, rather than being \"awkward\" as you say.\n\nBy having more mediums, you take up *more* spots in Google, getting you more traffic. But most of your Etsy traffic probably wouldn't come from Google anyway; it would come from people searching inside Etsy! Thus the Etsy store would be a source of traffic and sales that you otherwise wouldn't have, and you're leaving money on the table by not having it. Moreover, being on a platform like Etsy or Amazon adds a trust factor where some buyers prefer to buy through Etsy or Amazon rather than from a standalone website.\n\n&gt; You're dependent on one huge marketplace. One day Etsy can change their search algorithms and you may lose most of your traffic and sales. Etsy sale fees are quite low at the moment, but no one knows when they could change them and charge 10% of the sales as Ebay does that. This is a really tricky game because one day your Etsy shop can start to die out for unknown algorithm changes.\n\nThis is also true of Shopify! And Google! You're not taking your own advice. You're now putting all your eggs in one basket by only being on a Shopify-hosted site. Google is constantly changing their algorithm. Shopify can - and has already - change their features/fees at any time.\n\n&gt; I was gaining traffic from social media and any other sources, but it just went away.\n\nJust because your conversion rate is low doesn't at all mean that the traffic \"went away\" or went to another shop on Etsy.

If you want to just set something up quickly then go with Shopify but good luck ever wanting to switch, it'll be a pain in the ass recreating your product lists, etc.\n", "id": "d4ao3ey", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1466022304, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4o94yi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 0, "ups": 0, "author": "GeekGiftsUnder50", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1469064846, "parent_id": "t3_4o94yi"}

What areas could those resources be removed from? Is spending time on customer relations going to yield as much profit as spending the time on keyword research for example?\n\nYour first question in itself is quite obvious. Retail stores, fast food chains, clothing companies, and the service industry all look at adding value adds in the customer service realm. If someone is just starting out, by adding that extra communication and reassurance it helps in reaping a continued service and receiving a better review. I understand that once you have a huge business your time and focus should shift, but when you have 0-5 bookings a month... there really shouldn't be an excuse. I did reply to someone on here about two individuals who own detailing companies and spend an enormous amount of time in the education realm. When they notify a client and provide information as well as provide helpful teaching, the customers come back for more and I believe are able to trust that service company over another. \nAlso there are tools and websites (for free) that aid in keyword research... It really shouldn't be something you are spending 24/7 on. \n\n&gt;How is somebody going to \"turn around on you\" if you don't have contracts?

Ultimately though every city, state, and country has its own laws for this so I cannot paint the picture with a broad brush.

I think your product looks great but the site just isn't doing it justice. Maybe look for a theme with a large slider where you can show off the product a big higher up the fold.\n\nAt $195, even if that's AUD, I don't think this is an impulse buy. Your product images are crucial, I think that'll make or break the sale, particularly since is a premium product. Use only the absolute best quality photos, and either learn more about photography or get a professional product photographer to take some for you. Crop all of the photos to the same size so that there's not a huge empty space underneath when it's displaying a smaller photo.\n\nThe \"Create your X\" images text is unreadable, re-do them with text easier to read. Tip: use Paint.NET or Mac equivalent, make 2 layers, one the image, another a completely black layer on top of it. Cut away top 2/3rds of the black, then make the layer 20-90% opacity (whatever looks good) and put the text in white on top of the black. This will look way better and easier to read.\n\nIn general, this call to action is very weak. I think you should have a stronger standout colour button that has something like [Get Started Now] and then takes them into the process. Maybe that brings them to another page where they're informed of what they need to go ahead with the order (a photo, etc) and some info on how the process works. It could be that you'd be better served with a different CMS, where you can gather information better in the sale process, but for now Shopify should suffice.\n\nI think this is the kind of product where you can blog about your process. Do a step by step blog post or post here, e.g. see how popular this post is: ---LINK--- \n\nAbout page: needs more information about you. Same question as above: why should a prospective customer trust you with their money? Show me photos of you, your garage workspace, etc. And don't be lazy, link the Facebook etc in the page!\n\nEmail subscription: see what I wrote on most of the reviews above - \"Sign up and we'll fill your inbox with even more email you don't want to read\" is just not compelling enough. You can do better :)\n\nIt felt slow to me, but when I ran a speed test the numbers looked decent (as did all the other Shopify sites tested here).

{"id": "d4i3gfl", "body": "This, so much this!\n\nA boat load of people think marketing is fun and games. Facebook posts and event planning. They also assume if they have a degree they instantly get a high paying \"fun job\". No no no. I will never forget my marketing program had a team from Fox Broadcasting come through. The head of their DVD marketing group told 120 of us straight up that less than 6 of us will work ourselves into meaningful positions in marketing programs. The majority of those that graduate with marketing degrees will ultimately find themselves in other areas of life &amp; business. Fact is, people are not dedicated enough and can't figure it out. They just want the paycheck and the facebook.\n\nThis is the hard truth: In marketing you are first and foremost your biggest client and customer. You need to sell the shit out of yourself and then be able to back it up and generate a positive return on your investment.\n\nIn your wife's marketing program she learned how to analyze brands, build strategy, prepare budgets and most importantly -- put presentations together. \n\nThere are TONS of small and medium size businesses that need help in marketing their business. Sometimes it pays off to do your own analysis, find a business that you think you are 1) interested in and 2) can dramatically improve. \n\nBuild a plan. Get someones attention (higher ups are easy to reach if you are persistent and play the phone directory game, google is your friend). Remember, you are running an active campaign against these guys. Your job is to get yourself hired. \n\nGet them on the phone, make a pitch and get a slot for a presentation. Impress the shit out of them and let them know you would like to be part of the team, or lead the team, to implement a new strategy (theirs or yours) to grow their business. Then, don't quit following up. Offer to volunteer at events so that you can get to know the team and impress them. Remember, you are interviewing them as they are interviewing you. Play the long game if you really want it.\n\nDon't just throw words like advertising and social media in there. That shit is old and tired. Figure out what challenges they are facing &amp; what opportunities exist. You should be able to do this through open source research. Is the market changing? A new one developing? Is the economy slowing or growing? What about demographic shifts?\n\nShow them how you can radically grow their business and increase their net profits. Have costs and ROI built in. Know their business, market and customer better than they do. Your presentation should be hard evidence &amp; real world examples of people (and competitors) doing it right. If it doesn't work, not to worry. Don't let the hard work go to waste. You now have a full marketing strategy / portfolio piece with real world application ready for your next interview. Or, you find another target of opportunity and start war gaming.\n\nThis has worked time and time again on my side. It pays to be bold and have your ducks in a row. You set yourself apart from day one and you will create your own opportunity. People take bold violent action so fucking seriously it hurts. With all that, stay humble, show your passion, and have a plan. You don't want to come off as a jerk, but rather someone highly passionate that truly believes in what they (both you &amp; the target business) are doing. This is HUGE. Sound analysis presented eloquently with actionable strategy will take you far.\n\nMake your own life, your own plan, and your own path. Don't read blogs or podcasts about this shit unless its on a technical level (how to optimize your adwords vs how to get a job). Most of that crap is old as the textbooks you studied in school. They are trying to sell you affiliate shit, not help you. \n\nTodays business world moves fast, hires lean, and requires a ton out of the hired help (\"team\"). If you don't cut it you won't be paid for long. Have heart and have hustle. Talk to people out there doing this, get a mentor, study your ass off so you can build your toolset. Learn how to take photos, edit videos, setup a website, shopify, google adwords, youtube, host an event, build a budget, etc. This will all help you to be a better marketer and a better business person. At the end of the day, you are your own product and client. Act accordingly.\n\nWhatever you do, just get to work.

After this, I would suggest you buy Anton's course (buddy of mine - this is not an affiliate link: ---LINK---\n\n* Pick a product that upper middle class people have disposable income to enjoy. This product should not rely on brands (like Sony...etc). Think, for example - kiteboards. Kiteboarding is something that affluent upper-middle class people would look for and pay for. You want your items to cost at least over $200. Luxury chess boards is another example. At-home bar stools...etc. \n\n* After you come up with ideas for niches, begin researching them. Type them in, see what results come up. You will inevitably find other stores offering these things, go to those stores and see what they're charging. \n\n* When you go to other stores to see the products, and they seem in demand, then lookup the manufacturers who created those products. This takes some digging and detective work, but it's really just common sense. Click the product, see if there is info on the manufacterer in the description, google it if it's not there, and so on. \n\n* Begin making a list of manufacturers of this product. Most of these manufacturers do not do retail themselves, most have websites with contact information on who to talk to about ordering their products to sell. Compile all this info into a spreadsheet, try to get at least ten manufacturers listed (more if you can). \n\n* Pay for someone (or do it yourself) to create a Shopify store for you for this product. No, you don't have products to load it up with yet, but you need something to show. Think of this as your business storefront. Load fake products onto it, make sure it's branded, get a toll-free 1.800 number that's listed at the top. \n\n* Begin contacting the manufacturers on your list - call them, email them. Tell them you have an online store, you'd like to sell their products. You will forward the orders for them to ship directly. \n\n* About two to five will usually jump on board. They'll send you a catalogue of their products/prices and you load them onto your Shopify store. Mark up the price about 20% - this is how much you will make off each sale. \n\n* Next begin advertising your store via Google retail ads (DropShipLifestyle.com has information on how to optimize this). \n\n* When you get orders, forward those orders to the manufacturer and keep the difference. \n\nExpect to make about $5,000 to $15,000 month net with between one to three stores. \n\nIf you work hard and make it profitable, you can sell these stores.

{"body": "You're thinking with more enthusiasm than reality, which is standard for any new venture, but let's take a look through a different lens.\n\n1. There is a reason people buy homes / lease apartments. They provide a level of peace of mind and security that boats/RVs/tiny houses just do not offer. If you're living in an apartment or a house, you have a full set of constitutional rights with well established safeguards and they are relatively easy to make reasonably secure from officious police and thieves. On the other hand, if your residence can be hotwired or hooked up to a trailer, that's a lot less secure. Further, you'll have to worry about where to park it. Campground fees add up fast, and parking on the street can annoy the neighbors and has other risks.\n\n2. Do what you love because you love it, not because it brings in money. If you're properly focused and motivated, you have PLENTY of time on the evenings and weekends to improve your skills and open a shopify site, sell things on etsy, start a youtube channel, get stuff up on bandcamp, etc. If that's not enough time, then give yourself 3-6 months of full-time effort to make serious progress, and if you've made serious progress, keep it going, and if you haven't, then get a day job and keep it as a hobby. But don't half-ass it. There is no surer way to kill your dreams and become miserable than by living a starving student lifestyle so you can live as a artist doing what you love, only to spend your days sleeping until 2, before getting high, realizing the day's already gone, and heading off to a party with some friends, thinking you'll do better tomorrow. (I live in L.A., and around a third of the economy is based on these people.)\n\n3. Having a day job and an actual apartment/house adds structure and makes it a lot easier to do the things you want to do. Your art/passion/etc. can be a lot more reflective of what you actually want to do with it, when you're doing it for its own sake, rather than because it actually has to provide you with income, and it's a lot easier to hang out with likeminded people when they can stop by your place for a while, not to mention it's tricky to get letters/paychecks when you don't have a fixed mailing address.\n\n4. Nobody has to work for somebody \"their whole life\" but it's a lot easier to make artistic choices with a roof over your head and a steady income and a savings account with 3-6 months of living expenses. Being an entrepreneur / artist and being an employee are not mutually exclusive. Treat your employer like a patron of your artistic efforts rather than a soulless corporation grinding down your creativity.\n\n5. Talk to people working in the fields you want to succeed in, and see what they did. If you find that most of them found the tiny house or /r/vandwellers lifestyle in an affordable part of the country the way to go, then they may indeed be right. On the other hand, if they recommend moving to a major city, and taking a day job to be able to afford it, so you can make the necessary connections and build the necessary network so your dream career can grow, that might be worth listening to.", "id": "d4l566x", "subreddit": "simpleliving", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0za", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1466707267, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4pfiqm", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "ups": 3, "author": "jbisinla", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1469245616, "parent_id": "t3_4pfiqm"}

{"id": "d4nfof9", "body": "Not an employer but a former executive recruiter with some thoughts:\n\nDo you really want a job, or do you just want to dick around with an hour or four of \"job hunting\" per day so you can surf reddit and porn without feeling guilty? There's nothing wrong with either answer, but clarifying your motives will make it much easier to achieve your goals. If you're just dicking around, make sure your bank account is in OK shape, check craigslist, send out a few resumes, and get back to being euphoric in this moment. If you DO want a job, then start behaving like a busy and employable little worker bee, and adjust your behavior accordingly.\n\nSet your alarm clock for 7AM, wake up, shower, dress in clean and presentable clothing, put on shoes and socks, make yourself  breakfast and lunch, put your lunch in the fridge, and eat breakfast and dick around until 9AM. (Commuting will take the place of dicking around eventually, but unemployment has to have a few perks.)\n\nNow you're on the clock. Understand the difference between selling a product and buying a lottery ticket. When you buy a lottery ticket, you know you're probably not going to win, and there's a cost for buying the ticket, so it seems fun, but it's a cumulative drain. Likewise with applying for random fun jobs that you're not really qualified for. Sure, the guy just might want someone your age and skillset for a job requiring something completely different, but odds are it's a waste of your and their time. It's fine to buy lottery tickets, just don't do it while you're on the clock. \n\nWhile you're on the clock, you have to figure out what your skills are, what you want to do, and what's available in your area. You're not going to get a job as a ski instructor in Floriday, and you're not going to get a job as a gun store clerk in San Francisco. Odds are, your next job is going to be pretty similar to your last job, unless you get training in something else, or start over at a lower level.\n\nFor now, we'll be starting with jobs you could step into tomorrow, and be up to speed as a functional employee by the end of the week.\n\nWho are they? Where are they? What are they? Figure that out.\n\nThen start putting together your network. Do any of your friends/family/facebook acquaintances work for these companies / know anybody at these companies / do similar jobs? Can they set up an informational interview, where you talk to them about the job to learn more about what it really entails, without pressuring them for a position that may not exist. Ask them during the interview who they might know who might be looking. Also do this with your school's alumni association. People LOVE talking about themselves, and this will help you learn more about the field and meet more people in it.\n\nKeep working that network. Get out of the house. Meet people for coffee. Call them on the phone. Many jobs are not advertised, so they don't exist to you until someone in your network mentions it.\n\nThis gets exhausting, so take breaks and send out \"lottery ticket\" emails in response to craigslist/indeed/whatever postings, but focus your resume on how you could step into that job tomorrow, and how your skills/experience/education have allowed you to do that.\n\nConsider entrepreneurship. Most desk jobs require zero in the way of startup capital, as you've already got a desk and a computer and a word processor/spreadsheet program and an internet connection and a printer available. Those ARE the means of production that Marx wanted the workers to control, and you're the worker that controls them. Hang out a shingle, start a blog, do youtube instructional videos, open a shopify store, and begin building your brand. Not only will this make it easier for you to get hired, since you're now a recognized expert in that field of endeavor, you may build a following and be able to open up revenue channels on your own.\n\n5-6PM. Call it a day. Have a nice dinner. Hit the gym or go for a bike ride and work on getting lean/fit/strong. Thin/beauty privilege is real, and if you're unemployed, you need all the advantages you can get. The more you look like a lean, healthy, confident, capable professional, and less like a fat and panic-stricken underperformer, the easier your life will be. Clean your house. A clean home is much more calming than a messy one. Get plenty of sleep. This also helps with the stress reduction.\n\nLastly, avoid the obvious fuckups. \n\nShow up EXACTLY 3 minutes early. Showing up 10 minutes early makes you look needy, and showing up late makes you look disrespectful, and neither is a good look. \n\nWear clean and appropriate clothing. Have a suit available, and have it properly tailored.\n\nPolish your shoes. (Wear shoes that need occasional polishing, not sneakers or sandals.)\n\nIf you're not applying for a job as a record store clerk / barista / bartender, get a professional haircut, shave, wear full length clothing that hides any substantial amount of tattooing, etc. (If you wanted a job where you could let your freak flag fly, you'd be practicing your guitar/Ableton/Instagram/whatever and making it happen, rather than reading this. If you're reading this, you need to look like a friendly well shaped cog that will fit right into their machine, so you can pay off your debts and build some savings so you can have the $ to get your freak on later.) \n\nSpellcheck your resume. Then reread your resume so that homonyms and whatnot didn't get confused and make your resume look like it was written by an ESL student. \n\nDo not talk badly about your former employer. The standard answer for why you're looking for a new job involves using the words \"challenge, opportunity and growth\" so keep it positive and talk about moving forward. If they ask about why you left your last job, be as honest as possible without making yourself or your former employer look bad.\n\nAt the end of the day, remember this is your life, and you only get to live it once, and as long as you avoid addictions / mental health issues, you're probably not going to become homeless, so if you find yourself going through the motions for more than a day or two at a time, stop and regroup and either a) start looking for a field you'd be willing to do more than just half-ass it to get a job in, or b) realize this is just your NEXT job, not your LAST job. This next job is just there to stop the time gap in your resume, and give you a paycheck and anything more than that is a bonus. Once you get a job, then you can keep spending your evenings and weekends looking for a BETTER job, which will be easier because you're no longer unemployed, or taking classes and networking to do whatever it is you really want to do.\n\nHoly cow, this turned into a novel.

{"id": "d4oecho", "body": "How long is a piece of string? The answer to your question is endlessly broad mainly because we have no idea what you actually want to do.\n\nHere's the way that the internet is moving at the moment. A split between niche-websites and authority-websites. \n\nNiche websites have 50(ish) pieces of content relating to a very specific topic. They are monetized through affiliate marketing, amazon affiliates, etc. some are even monetized through Google adwords (though this is dying out). Once they are up and in place - the owner will normally slowly drip feed additional content to keep Google rankings. \n\nThe advantages of niche websites is they're relatively cheap to make and support. The disadvantages are that they generally don't make that much money $500-$1,000 a month before costs are deducted. They can take from 6-9 months to become fully profitable and their success depends on your doing keyword research and SEO successfully. Buying traffic for these sites is usually a no-no.\n\nAuthority sites have 1,500+ pages of content on a much broader theme. They target multiple groups of keywords relating to related subjects. They're the \"big beasts\" of the internet. Assuming you're starting from scratch - you can expect to put in 1-2 years work to deliver this kind of site (a bit less if you can outsource). If they do well they can pay off with large rewards $5-$10K a month is not unusual and some do much more. If they don't - you're out a year's  (or more) work. These sites will use multiple forms of monetization from selling training, affiliate products, e-books, etc. to adwords, Amazon, etc. They require large amounts of expertise to run. They also require razor sharp keyword research and SEO to maximize the investment.\n\nIn terms of technical knowledge - you need (at a minimum) the following (or you can outsource it all or in part):\n\n- Keyword Research Skills\n- SEO knowledge\n- SEM knowledge\n- MailChimp (or better still Aweber)\n- WordPress\n- Social Media promotion knowledge\n- Affiliate marketing knowledge\n- Amazon/Google/etc. knowledge\n\nYou probably don't need Shopify unless you intend to flog your own products.\n\nIn terms of softer-skills you need (or you need to outsource):\n\n- Domain Knowledge\n- Writing skills\n- Design skills\n- Marketing skills\n- Sales skills\n- Accounting skills\n\nSadly, there's no single book that covers all that. Not even close. The idea that running an online business is easy simply isn't true. It was once. (I could once rank a site Number 1 on Google by uploading a PDF full of keywords to the same hosting space as the website - try that today and it will have no impact at all and may even get your site banned from Google). It isn't now. All the \"easy\" low hanging fruit was long since gobbled up and now serious players (with serious cash) fight over the higher branches. You can start an internet business and make good money but it's a ton of work (even if you have cash to make it easier) and that \"passive income\"? It's a pipe dream.

The main fold logo / double navigation is a bit too large, and the image is too obviously stock. A user has to scroll to understand what you do, which isn't ideal.

Consider \"Buy Lug Nuts from Leading Brands.\"\n\n3. The 'faq' link for brand lookup isn't optimal, because FAQ sounds like work... \"I have to read??\" It would be more user-friendly if you used car make / models as Collections (Shopify feature) and then added those logs as square boxes in a grid, for this section. Let the user go straight to their group of options.\n\n4. You have too many random items on the home page, with no description of why those have been chosen. Consider a sub-headline above those (smaller than your site's [new] headline) that says something like \"Recently Viewed\" or \"Popular Items.\" There are also some free plugins that will create these groups of items dynamically for you.\n\n5. On your product pages, you may want to check out the [Product Description Tabs]---LINK--- app. This will help tidy up the extra information section, letting the user dictate what they want to know by context as well as not forcing them to scroll too much.\n\n6.

{"body": "Hi, I am the cofounder of [phototheme.net]---LINK---, I hope I can provide some help.\n\nYou are looking for lot of things here. I have gone through 100s of photography website building solutions while starting up PhotoTheme, but I haven't seen something which satisfies all the things you want. The most suitable thing for you will be to choose something which has most of the things you are looking for and then hire a developer to customize it to the way you want it.\n\nYour options are fairly limited.\n\n* Squarespace, Format, Smugmug etc will get you vendor-locked. You can't easily move out from them once you join. Also, you won't get the customization you are looking for. There is no file level access. These services are typically good for those who want to quickly make a simple generic website.\n* Wordpress.COM wouldn't work because they do not allow you to add custom themes. They are very limited if you want customization\n* Koken is a nice option but you won't find much themes or plugins and this will make it all more difficult to customize.\n\nSince, you are already familiar with wordpress, I would suggest to go with a self hosted wordpress instead of wordpress.**com**. This offers the highest level of customization, there are millions of themes and plugins readily available for your needs. There are lot of tutorials on all kindof things. Most web developers would be familiar with it, if you want high level of customization. Also, you are not vendor-locked.\n\n\nWhat PhotoTheme offers is a WordPress theme which is exclusively built for photographers. In many ways, it is like a custom build website. We offer customization services too. \n\nI think it meets your needs in several ways --&gt;\n\n&gt; I was looking into using software like Adobe Muse and/or Adobe DreamWeaver to design the website. The problem is that these programs require file level access which wordpress.com does not support.\n&gt; \n\nYou have file level access and anything can be changed.\n\n&gt; I am picky about vendor lock in when setting up the website. I want the freedom to dump one provider if I see something better.\n&gt; \n\nYou can dump and move to something else anytime. You are infact hosting the site on your own hosting, so you have 100% control.\n\n&gt; I also want a CDN like Cloudflare to make pages load faster and to protect the website.\n&gt; \n\nIt is easy to use CDN with a wordpress site. It just require you to install a plugin and add your cdn's keys to it. Cloudflare themselves offer the plugin for that. Or, you can use some cache plugin like WP super cache.\n\n&gt; I want to install plugins such as a shopping cart plugin to sell the photos or a CAPTCHA to stop spam.\n&gt; \n\nYou can install any plugin you like. Woocommerce plugin is generally used to sell things in Wordpress. Our themes currently do not shopping feature by default. This feature is under construction, and all our themes are expected to have it within a month.\nThere are plenty of plugins for stopping spam in wordpress.\n\n&gt; I am looking to sell the photos on an individual basis. I want to give customers the option to order a print with one photo or a custom mosaic consisting of two or four photos.\n&gt;\n\nI doubt if any service offers this by default. But it is feasible to custom build this feature for a wordpress site.\n\n&gt; I plan on using watermarks that are difficult to remove for the free sample but I want to protect the version without the watermark so it is not used without my permission.\n&gt; \n\nOur customers use plugins like right click protection etc. But, I personally think there is no practical way to protect your images from being used without your permission. You can do lot of things to make it difficult for anyone to use, like by adding a copyright message, but nothing really fully protects it.\n\n&gt; I am looking to have the contact forms connect to different email addresses so stuff that is personally addressed to me goes to me while inquiries about licensing and prints are separate. This is so only I get stuff addressed to me personally while I can have someone deal with print orders in the event I travel to a remote location.\n&gt; \n\nYou can easily do this with contact form plugin.\n\n&gt;I also want a credit card processor that charges low fees and preferably has charge back protection.\n&gt;\n\nEasy ones are Paypal, Stripe, Authorize.net, Square. There are some other solutions which charge more fee, similar to shopify, but those are usually worth it only if you have large volume of sales. They all allow creditcards too.\n\n&gt;What web host do you or other photographers use? Which one would you recommend?\n&gt;\nBlueHost is good and fast. I have had good experiance with this not so popular company too-  ifastnet.com\nIn all of these hosts, you can install wordpress with just few clicks. If most of your customers are concentrated in a particular area, then I suggest to choose a host which is as near to that place as possible.\n\n\nI hope this was helpful.

If you're just selling a few products and have no care about taxes, shipping charges, etc then you can certainly hook up with something like Stripe and sell some basic products.

One of my (ex) biggest clients is migrating to Shopify because their Magento hosting costs are ~$12K+ a month (only one of the reasons). Admittedly they were oversold an AWS solution through Bulletproof with all levels of redundancy that I disagreed with at the time, which added to their costs but it's still a decent chunk of money.\n\nLet's take the Amasty Data Feed extension. They sell it on Shopify for $9 a month and any owner can install with a click of a button. Amasty Data Feed for Magento community is $188 US with installation. That's 20 months on shopify before it's costing more than Magento. If you're using an Agency that is doing deployments, they won't like Amasty installing and is more likely to charge project management fees etc and it might cost $250-500 to get that installed.\n\nI have another client on Shopify, they typically do ~$200-400K a month in sales but this month did $500K in a single hour and Shopify didn't even blink.

The desktop version suffers pretty badly. \n\n - Big warning sign to customer confidence here - there is no contact number, business hours, SSL, or physical address on the homepage. This says to me 'home business' or 'one-man business' which is not necessarily the impression you want to give out.\n\n - Promote a generous return policy bigger on the homepage - customer confidence is absolutely key on the homepage.\n\n - Strongly consider a toll-free number. Not having an address OR a phone number on your contact page will kill your conversions. \n\n - I have no idea who you are, where you are, or how to get in touch with you on your contact page; just an email. Not good.\n\n - Even if you have to fake it, put a pic of some staff members (or just gather some friends together for a pic) and give the appearance of being a legit established business and place it on your 'About' page.\n\n - Your social media links to go Shopify pages.\n\n - Dont ever let anyone think you are an established business and go to your facebook page and see 8 likes. If you don't have a social media presence and you must, then fake it. Perception is everything.\n\n - Everything here looks brand new, like you are just starting out. People are reluctant to buy from something that looks like it has just started. You need the appearance that you have been doing this a while. Get some significant amount of blog posts written then post them.\n\n - The actual product pages look pretty good - clean, informative, good pics, etc.\n\nThis is all visual, I won't get into any coding, tags, or SEO optimization parts of the site.

If you are driving traffic to a sales page, I'd assume your sales conversion rate is 0.5% - 2% of all visitors -- so basically 98-99.5% of ALL visitors from your ads would take NO desired action, no way for you to follow-up and convert via email. If most of your conversions are coming via email, your advertising goals should be to do efforts that drive opt-ins... contests for free stuff, white papers on bluetooth differences, a free MP3 download, anything you can test to see what performs the best for different types of traffic. \n\nAre you doing content marketing? When you convert people, are they seeing content articles prior to purchase? A video? A short video? A long video? What does your funnel and touch points look like and have you used a/b testing software to test showing different offers? \n\nWhat makes you obsessed about your product? Is it the BEST for running?

Then do a reoccuring product (use the bold shopify app for this) for people getting a monthly quilt box for that price, maybe with some sort of discount for paying 3-6-12 months up front. Then on all your pages, offer to give people 30-50% off their first Quilt Box by giving you their email address. A coupon + newsletter updates.\n\nThen focus all your marketing around the quilt box, the concept of trying new fabrics and being inspired by fabric. If you get 3 random samples, what will you be inspired to make? With each box, make it easy for someone to go back to the store to buy more of that fabric.\n\n\"Monthly inspiration for everyone who loves quilting.\" \n\n\"Give the gift of inspirational quilting to someone you love.\" \n\n\"Give the gift of inspiration for the quilter in your life. Love your fabric.\" \n\n// You need to start writing blog posts about quilting - it could be mostly images. You just need to be putting out content to an audience or have something available on your website. I'd add \"Quilting Articles\" Or \"Blog\" to your menu bar. \n\nOnce you are writing articles, make sure you have setup a Facebook Business account, a facebook advertising account, and then add your Facebook custom audience pixel to your shopify theme. You'll start to pixel all your visitors so you can serve them FB ads. Once you do that, you can setup the Shopify Product Feed via Facebook Business Manager + Shopify (both have customer support to help with this) and you can setup retargeting advertising for people who browse for products but don't buy - basically automatic ads that you barely have to touch but help to drive people back to complete purchases. \n\nStart to retarget any website visitors to get the monthly box - start to write blog posts that explain the concept and expand upon this \"Find your creativity\" aspect. Buy ads for the content. Retarget people who view the content with ads for the monthly box. \n\nRinse and repeat. \n\nGood luck! \n", "subreddit": "shopify", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sn78", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1467176727, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4qc30c", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1469367672, "author": "tzse", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 4, "parent_id": "t1_d4s3vdw"}

It's by far the most high profile and there is a lot of interesting performance work going on and you can learn a lot by watching Aaron Patterson's commits. Liquid and Liquid-c are directly needed by Shopify and performance work is massively appreciated. Most of that work happens in C. \n\nWhich brings me to another point: Shopify doesn't actually hire Ruby devs. It's a plus but less then half of the developers work on Ruby i'd say. JavaScript (ES6) is massive at Shopify due to the UX heavyness of our product. There is a lot of Go, a lot of Java (Android), Swift (iOS), and C extensions going on. \n\nIf you want my personal opinion: Learn plain Javascript sans any frameworks and learn how to make it really really fast. The frontend Javascript community has shot itself in the foot by not paying attention to performance and the web got too slow. There is going to be a ton of opportunities for people who can make it fast again.
