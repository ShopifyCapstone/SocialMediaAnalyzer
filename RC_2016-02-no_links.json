Do you think you could have done some of these yourself via sites like Shopify or BigCommerce? Granted the initial learning curve would take some time, but you could probably get 5-10 pretty good templates going and just churn those out like crazy while maximizing profits. That was my angle and I would love to hear why you wouldn't do that.\n\n\n* Have you thought about hiring a full time cold caller? Maybe pay someone $12 - $15 per hour, plus bonuses on landing new clients/meetings?\n\n*   Did you have any luck with restaurants/pizza shops? This is the niche I'd like to explore as probably 75% of the food places around my town have terrible websites that may or may not have the simplest things like a menu, phone number, and hours of operation. It's just baffling.\n\nThank you again, great writeup. This coming from a seasoned veteran (14 years) of cold calling and telephone sales.

{"id": "czm5gpl", "body": "Hi /u/kalvel/,\n\nFirst of all - thank you for the AMA! You have no idea how much this helps people like me..\n\nMy friend and I have planned to launch a eCommerce-dropshipping-company for some time now. Mainly because I am from Finland (northern Europe) and shipping from China is slow &amp; expensive which means that a local storage is not possible as shipping to the US -- i.e. the customer -- would lead to double shipping costs. So dropshipping is the way to go.\n\nWe have put a lot of time into research; on aliexpress, google trends, twitter trends and various blogs. So we have a pretty nice list of products that would most probably sell well -- with decent margins. \n\nFurthermore, I know the advantages of having a specific niche so that marketing becomes more focused. Our products, however, are not necessarily in the same niche. \n\nSo my first question is: \n\n1. If you think that it would wise to launch multiple webshops for different niches or start with all in the same.\nThis varies on the products of course. I mean it would seem weird to have cooking wear and weapon replicas in the same store. But would you recommend e.g. setting up different shops, domains, brands etc for a) suit watches, b) fitness accessories, c) leather wallets.\n\n2. Set aside the fact that you are currently promoting the ali importer app (which I think is great btw). Would you start using Ali Importer from day one when you have started with minimal budget (couple hundred euros) - while you have no clue if you will succeed or not. Would you recommend doing the ordering manually for the first hundred orders?\n\n3. You told us that you started with only a few hundred dollars. Did your partner invest a lot more or did you actually start with under $500? You would probably have only a couple hundred left after the shopify expenses and the domain. Did you pour the last pennies into the facebook ad campaign and then reinvested everything into the ad loop until you reached the 5k/day advertising limit?\n\n4. Do you recommend translating the webshop to languages you know? (You mentioned south America in another answer, but did not address the topic in general).\nI would guess that you are German, Lithuanian or live in Germany. Germany is obviously a huge market, however, the target audience has no problem with using English. Do you think it is worth to go through the trouble of translating the webshop for a market such as Germany or a smaller country e.g. Finland (5M) or Sweden (10M)?\n\nBonus: How does the shopify hosting work otherwise. Can you use your domain as any hosting service would allow or does shopify restrict this so that you can only access \"the code\" from the shopify online web UI? I am a web dev myself, that's why I'm wondering. How did you build the automation into the system? With RoR, Django, NODE, PHP?\n\nFeel free to send me a PM if you are not comfortable to share something publicly. \n\nSorry for the insanely long message and once again -- thank you so much for this!\n\nCheers", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1454500170, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_43uo3x", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "ups": 2, "author": "itsstifu", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1458260716, "parent_id": "t3_43uo3x"}

{"body": "You think adding veins changes the core logo? I don't think it's a big deal adding veins to a logo, and making some distinction between the \"core\" logo and the stars (which make up the logo) is silly. A logo is everything encompassed in it, not what you decide is and isn't a part of it.\n\n&gt;They only added that in 2010 though, after having 3 lines since it was originally designed, so I'd say it half counts, in that it definitively was not part of the actual design process and was just an addendum, which is fine, but again, as a designer we have to consider the possibilities.\n\nThey added it in 2010 when they returned to that logo. That's a redesign, even if it harkens back to a previous logo.\n\n&gt;Perhaps, but at a certain point it just becomes arbitrary if the rules are changing on a whim. The Kings won two cups almost out of nowhere, and the Blackhawks won 3 despite major roster changes and after a decade of being horrible to mediocre at best. Despite the odds, as a designer we'd have to account for potential situations like that.\n\nIt's their right to arbitrarily make changes to the logo. Brands make tiny tweaks *all the time* - the Leafs even did it with their previous logo, altering the bright blue to navy blue. Claiming that an on the fly alteration for some reason isn't okay means that a tremendous amount of logos out there - including ones lauded as good - are bad.\n\n&gt;If as soon as the stripes become a detriment to the logo someone just decides \"Oh, uh, the each represent 2 cups now\" and adjust accordingly, then it just cheapens the entire thing.\n\nNo it doesn't. The totals can be arbitrary, they can be adaptive, they can shift meaning depending on the gross total. If those football teams won 15 consecutive titles and had no room for 3 more stars above their \"core\" logo, they would change that too. As it stands, 3 cups in 5 years is, without a doubt, the exception to the rule. That would present a fun discussion on how to handle it with a markable icon like the Islanders stick - it wouldn't present a design failure. Every change is not a failure.\n\n&gt;I mean you can justify it as much as you want but my point is it's poor design. \n\nAnd my point is it's not. Looking at sports logos in the same vein as, say, IBM or Shopify where meanings shift and brands change constantly - sometimes because it's needed, and sometimes because they just want change, is silly. Sports logos constantly update and change, and are rarely static, especially in the NHL. No team hasn't made an alteration of some sort to their logo. Sometimes it's to better suit their jerseys (like when Reebok got the contract for the NHL), which in any other industry aside from sports, would be a ridiculous thing to do.", "id": "czmrx2m", "subreddit": "graphic_design", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmtk", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1454535653, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_43y0v3", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1458271509, "author": "mattattaxx", "edited": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_czmqv44"}

Even for the folks that will say \"BUT!  But Magento is FREEEEEEE!\", you still have to buy the boxes that Magento will run on.  Do that math and get back to me...\n\nIt boils down like this:  If you're new and doing less than $50k/yr, you'll pay $30/mo.  If you've picked up some steam and gotten to $50k-$125k, you'll pay $80/mo.  Once you get pretty far up there (more than 3k orders/yr) it goes to $200 + an additional $80 for each 1k orders past 3k.  If you have an average order value of less than $80, they'll cut you a deal on the $200-and-up plan.\n\nOnce you reach north of $1M/yr in sales (first off, \"FUCK YEAH, GO DUDE!\"), it becomes a negotiation for the Enterprise platform.\n\nAgain, I know I'm biased, I've worked in and around BC for about five years.  That said, I've also worked with Shopify, Magento, Hybris, Demandware, and a few other lesser known guys.

This is my favourite one, and the one i've seen most success with. When you're setting up your Twitter ads, you simply put in your competitor's twitter handles, and Twitter will automatically make an audience of their followers. This can also guide what creative you put in your ad (i.e. talk about why you're better).\n\n2. Immediate action. With Twitter ads, you can get email signups, contact information, and even purchases (see Shopify) right inside the ads.

Maybe you could shrink the logo a little to make it less bulky. \n\nYou should have the name prominently displayed. It's a good name, and you want people to know where they are. Right now it kinda looks like a parked domain selling trinkets (not trying to be a dick, but presentation is important. You wouldn't buy a car from someone in a dirt lot with a cardboard sign - even if the car was awesome). \n\nYou could use some larger images. There are themes that let you do this in Shopify. I'm a big fan of the Startup Theme. Try to find one with a \"Hero\" section, and showcase your best product there. It will look professional, grab attention, and keep people interested in what else you have.\n\nTry to get inside the mind of a customer. I would hate hearing that advice, so I'm going to try to explain HOW to do this with a few examples. The Legend of Zelda Cosplay Hat - I want to see how it looks when worn. How does it sag? Does it sit high up on the head, or does it come all the way down to my pointy ears? Can't tell from your image. For the creeper necklace - my nephew is obsessed with Minecraft, but I didn't think it was for him because you show the necklace on the chest of an adult woman. I would expect adult women not to be the end user of that gift (but I don't know). Also, just look at the language I used to describe that product - I called it a gift. These ideas that pop up in the mind of potential customers are under your influence.

{"id": "czuo6ml", "body": "I think the only ones who will really suffer due to this technological shift will be what we call the \"implementers\". The ones who really can't design and/or code beyond the basics, and are mainly making their living by installing a 3rd-party CMS with a ready-made theme, perhaps slightly altered for their client.  They're going to vanish because these new systems make it easier for anyone to build a basic site.  Some might survive due to the many clients out there who simply do not want to even go DIY with a site, but many more will vanish.\n\nDespite that loss, the survivors are those who can offer more than just setting up a website. No matter how many DIY frameworks pop up, many clients still have need for a designer to make sense of all the tools and thus deliver a professional-looking product.  Plus as I always say, **you can't escape branding**.  Many think branding is just changing some colors and adding in a client's logo, but it's waaaaay more, and it's something a DIY system can't get right on its own.\n\nWith all the \"bland sameness\" in web layouts now, many clients are demanding \"something that doesn't look like everyone else's site\", and thus you bring in a talented web designer to make it happen. You also have the era of illustration hitting the web, thus you need something more than just shopping a stock photo site.  Again, designers are needed.\n\nI'm also noticing a growing rejection of platform ecommerce sites like Etsy and Shopify, with clients and companies seeking their own private ecommerce setups. They don't want to be lost in the shuffle of saturation on those sites, and thus would rather be on their own (as well as not having to share a piece with the platform owner).\n\nLastly, many clients might be experts in their product/service, but they often are not in marketing. This is again what a talented web designer and/or developer can come in to fill said need. For much of what I get hired to do on a freelance level, it's more on internet marketing than just web design/development. It's at the point where yes, anyone can build a website, but these clients need experts who can market them online.\n\nThe job isn't dying...just evolving.", "subreddit": "web_design", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1m", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1455107827, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_451ovd", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "InternetArtisan", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1458407896, "parent_id": "t3_451ovd"}

However, the mass migration of virtually every office function to the cloud has not already started - but right now, if you were to start a business, and you chose desktop apps over SaaS apps for the majority of your back-office functions, I'd say you were misguided. From Xero to Salesforce to MailChimp to Google Domains to Google Analytics to Dropbox to Box to Zenefits to Justworks to Basecamp to Pivotal Tracker to Github to Paypal to Squarespace to Shopify to Tictail to Wordpress to Woocommerce to Zendesk to Jira to just *email* - everything is in the cloud. All of it. There is no real advantage to having this stuff as desktop software, honestly.\n\nAt this point, the *only* piece of desktop software for my practice are Microsoft Office, and our billing and document tracking software. Everything else is in the cloud. \n", "id": "czv53ax", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1455134881, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_454f7e", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1458416064, "author": "libertymcateer", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 4, "parent_id": "t3_454f7e"}

A lot of the photos have some sort of store ID number in the center, which makes it seem like you grabbed the images someplace...\n\n2. When I click on a menu item, it seems that the \"More\" sub links expand within the black area and go off screen until the page completely loads.\n\n3. The send us a message app on the bottom is great for converting those who are on the fence with their purchase, it worked great for our site. But you have to make it easy to contact you and signing into FB to do that shouldn't be a requirement. It should not take the place of an actual contact page also, it should compliment it.\n\n4. Why would I sign up for a newsletter? Are you offering coupons? Sales? Tips? Information? I also don't know if you're going to sell my information when I add my email address, because I can't find a privacy statement until I make it to the shopify checkout page.\n\n5. Pricing structure. Now this may not matter to others, but there is something weird with buying a product for \"31.40\". Is this $31.40 USD? I don't know because the site screams Chinese but I can't find a location to reference. Why not $31.99 instead of 31.40?\n\nAmazon is who you are competing with, even with generic products.

Although depending on your requirements and design expectations that could easily shoot to $50k and beyond.", "subreddit": "web_design", "edited": 1455430842, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1m", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1455430523, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_45ovm9", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "ups": 3, "author": "MrMorbid", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1458488747, "parent_id": "t3_45ovm9"}
{"id": "czzbvws", "body": "I can only speak for Hubspot, having worked for one of their VARS (please note the past tense...I'm not trying to sell you anything).\n\nI'm torn on whether it would work for you based on your main post and some of the comments below.\n\nThey do allow you to create buyer personas which would help segment your different groups (altho you'd need to figure out a workflow to automate it and that could get messy). All in all, I do think you could make it happen.\n\nAs for the CMS, you can do amazing things with it. It's actually pretty easy to work with and I agree with the other comment that their support rocks. You'd probably need an agency to help with this if you want to put your entire site on there, but if it's a smaller site it wouldn't be too pricey.\n\nShopping cart integration I believe shopify is one they integrate directly with. Could be wrong but as someone else said Zapier is free with HS and should work fine. So website you could keep your own domain (and have blog.domain) and be fine.\n\nWhere it gets iffy for me...you mentioned wanting A/B testing. This is only on their Enterprise software which was I believe 2400/mo last I knew and that was a year ago. For a one man show that may be overkill. You may also get other costs like implementation and hosting (altho working with their partners when moving the site can help you skip the training fee they have).\n\nAlso as for their editorial calendar and social monitoring, I think it's a miss. Again this has probably evolved since I worked with it BUT I don't think it'd do what you want. The editorial calendar is nothing more than your standard email calendar but you can email users when stuff is due. Cool if you have an agency doing content, excessive if it's all you. Another reason I'd say no.\n\nSocial monitoring is cool as someone here elaborated on but you're not going to get direct $$ attribution unless again you set up conversion tracking and add rules in yourself.\n\nHopefully this long schpeal helps (sorry it got way longer than I intended). Personally I think Hubspot may be too much for what you said you wanted to do. I'd suggest Google Analytics for A/B testing via expiriments. Or even something like optimizely. Social media tools I don't have a good suggestion because I'm not sure Hootsuite does enough itself. Feel free to reach out if you want more info on Hubspot though. Like I said, I worked for a partner in the past. Loved working with HS but I'm not afraid to point out flaws I saw.\n\nTLDR: Hubspot is probably overkill for you. Has a lot of what you need, but the cost may be a bit much for what it'd deliver.

For $50 a month I could build a $600 standard deck every year. Sure things rotate but people can recoup some of their investment by selling cards before and after rotation. I know the current standard is an exceptionally expense one.

What is your plan for recouping losses due to people disappearing with your cards? Not just the bad actors. Consumers make mistakes and forget about things and there will be bad actors. \nPeople with stolen credit cards would love a service like this. 50 for $500 worth of cards that they could instantly turn into $250 in cash and then stick you with the loss of the $50 for that month and a $25 charge back fee from whoever you use to process the credit cards. \n\nMaybe think smaller. 'Lease' people cards at $1 a day until they have reached 150% of the value of the card. This is where you will need to make some decisions and probably get a lawyer for writing a very strong user agreement and deciding on 'when' the value of the card is you are going to charge them. \n\nSeriously though, if you have the upfront capital and the time to invest just try running an exclusive MTGO shop selling and buying cards for a while.

I think the gray is just a bad choice of background. Play around with other colors or images. Even a blurred out image would probably look nicer.\n\n\n* Your logo is just a circle with text in it. I mean, it's actually not terrible and I really like the name but it's a little boring looking. Actually given a better site design I think this could work. But paired with an uninspiring template it also feels cheap.\n\n* Your company's name is MemeMilk but the shirts are entirely political. I would recommend one of two things: 1) expand your offerings to include actual meme-related merchandise. 2) change the name to something that is evocative of politics. I wouldn't conflate politics with memes. While they may seem meme-like very often (Hi, Trump!) your buyers are spending money on someone they actually believe in. \n\nOne final thought. I'm wondering if having a website selling both conservative *and* liberal propaganda will turn off buyers from both sides. I  think I would rather buy from a website that supported my point of view then one who supported both sides. Or maybe with each sale donate x% to the campaign. \n\nGood luck dude!

I'll do my best to give a neutral perspective into the pros and cons of hubspot. \n\nFirst of all, Hubspot is a VERY inbound-focused tool. If you are adopting hubspot because you need marketing automation only, they may not be the right fit. They may cover all your basic requirements on paper, but they are not nearly as well equipped for outbound email marketing, drip nurturing, workflow automation. I can get into specifics why on a call if you like. If you do not have a robust marketing automation need, there are probably less expensive solutions that can meet your requirements. Also, they do not play well with other pieces of software like Shopify or your CRM if you have one.  \n\nI'd give Hubspot a serious look if you:\n*Need a CMS to host a website, blog, and landing pages (hosted via hubspot) and this is your primary need, and email automation is a secondary requirement.\n*Do NOT need it to connect to another piece of software, and are okay with the Hubspot suite hosting all your digital marketing needs. (Using THEIR cms, blog tools, social tools, and CRM)\n*Are okay with them OWNING all your data, content, etc. You will not be able to easily extract anything should you decide to move to another platform in the future.\n\nAs I mentioned, we can delve into this further on a call if you like.

Would you guys mind chipping in how Big Commerce factors in when it comes to these points? \nMagento and Shopify Plus are two of the most popular solutions among growing eCommerce businesses and enterprise brands. Both of these platforms are extremely customizable, scale-able, and powerful. \n\nWhile they are both great choices for handling your eCommerce needs, there are slight differences in which one is best for you. \n\nThis comparison can help you decide which solution is best for your business.\nMagento vs. Shopify Plus in a nutshell\n\nShopify has long been known as one of the go-to options for eCommerce entrepreneurs looking to start up small businesses. Shopify Plus has all the benefits of Shopify, but is built to handle enterprise-level traffic &amp; sales. Shopify Plus is the best option for eCommerce store owners of any size looking for an option that is easy to set up and manage and requires less technical expertise. \n\nBiggest benefit: Ease\n\nMagento is a powerhouse for mid-to-enterprise size businesses. Magento requires more development than Shopify does at the outset, but it is extremely powerful for stores as they grow. \n\nBiggest benefit: Power\nThe biggest difference between Magento and Shopify Plus?\n\nHosting. \n\nMagento is a well-engineered open source product. It is a downloadable product (although they are working on a hosted version). Currently, it is not a hosted platform and requires a hosting provider who specializes in Magento hosting. Magento requires development by professional developers and designers who are specially trained in the Magento code. \n\nShopify Plus provides hosting when you sign up for a plan. This means you get a secure hosting account and a domain for your site. ServerCentral hosting is an enterprise level hosting platform. Automatic backups and Level 1 PCI compliance is provided. It's much easier to setup hosting, as opposed to Magento.\nMagento vs. Shopify Plus: Security\n\nThe bottom line: Security is solid for both Magento and Shopify. \n\nMagento: PCI Certified with SSL security support on the front and backend. You may need to sign up for your own CDN. is PCI Certified and SSL security support is offered for the front and backend. You may also have to sign up for your own CDN depending on if you need it or not.\n\nShopify Plus: Level 1 PCI DSS compliant (same level of protection as banks)\nMagento vs. Shopify Plus: Pricing\n\nNeither Shopify Plus or Magento offer exact pricing on their site, but in general, Magento is known to be the pricier option, starting at $18,000 a year for their Enterprise Version. However, Magento\u2019s Community Edition can accommodate large stores and starts with free pricing.\n\nWith Magento, you need to pay for hosting and a domain name. \n\nShopify Plus: No limit to sales volume, number of products, bandwidth, and no transaction fees. \n\nMagento vs. Shopify  Plus: Customization\n\nBoth Magento and Shopify Plus are completely customizable and both have robust theme marketplace with a mix of free and paid option.\n\nMagento allows you to connect to an FTP client, so it\u2019s easy to edit files, but it\u2019s also best for advanced users or stores working with experienced developers who are trained in working with Magento. \n\nShopify Plus\u2019 customizations happen mainly in conjunction with their large app store, which offers apps for nearly every need. They also have a team of agency \n\nFrontend &amp; Backend:\n\n-Screenshots of frontend + backend\n\nMagento\u2019s frontend is similar to Shopify in that it has coupon codes, a sleek checkout, gift cards and a customer dashboard. \n\nMagento has plenty of robust built-in features, like upsells and cross sells, related products wishlists, quantity discounts, saved shopping cart, order status module, zoomable images, and re-orders, promotional pricing, flexible coupons, free shipping, product bundling and more included. Strong newsletter subscription management feature that can integrate with coupon codes.\n\nNot all of these are built-in with Shopify Plus, but an app or developer can solve that. Magento is responsive. Although it may be confusing for beginners, the backend is extremely robust. Move around the dashboard with ease, and access reports and analytics right on the dashboard. This isn't as prevalent with Shopify. Manage payment processors, integrate with Authorize.net or PayPal, and even sell virtual products. Along with product tags, you can sort customers, use marketing features, set unlimited product attributes and more. Making a product isn't that hard, but product pages for Shopify are more basic.\n\nThe frontend is responsive for viewing on mobile devices, and it provides a nice checkout area and a minimalist design. It includes a website and blog, along with discount codes, real-time shipping and gift cards. Customer profiles are better in Magento, but you can improve them with tweaking.  Shopify provides a backend for both beginners and advanced users. Magento is more for developers, but you can learn it if need be and if you have enough time. \nDevelopers, Partners, and Community\n\nBoth Magento and Shopify Plus have a well-established community of partners and developers who specialize in developing for each platform. The developers for both platforms can design for custom needs and create personalized features.\n\nAdditionally, Shopify and Magento offer large app stores with free and paid options.\n\nThe difference is that Shopify Plus\u2019 app store has been built off of their extremely comprehensive Shopify app store. The app store is one of the main benefits for Shopify users, and Shopify Plus clients get special pricing on Shopify apps.  Additionally, businesses can also connect their store with existing IT platforms to create a seamless, integrated solution using the Shopify Plus API. That includes any ERP, CRM, and accounting systems, plus other software you might be using.\n\nMagento has a significant library of custom modules created by experienced developers. In Magento, you must download the app and upload it to your store, whereas with Shopify you can just click a button and stay in the Shopify dashboard. \n\nSEO: \nShopify Plus has the basic essentials for SEO, with robots.txt and sitemap.xml files, Canonical URL tags, and editable meta descriptions, URLs and title tags. Cleaner than Magento.\nMagento\u2019s SEO features are powerful. From SEO-friendly URLs, a Google sitem provides powerful SEO features like SEO friendly URLs, meta info (like Shopify,) a Google sitemap and a handy Google Content API for expanding on your SEO customization. \nBoth solutions can integrate with Google Analytics. \n\nSocial Commerce:\n\nShopify Plus allows enterprise merchants to easily sell across social networks like Facebook and Pinterest, but other social integrations require an app. \n\nOn Magento, no social media features are included, but you can integrate just about any app you want to make your site social friendly. \n\n \nReporting:\n\nBoth Magento and Shopify Plus offer great reporting systems. The difference is that Magento shows stats at a glance straight from the dashboard. Their reports are extremely comprehensive reports - including details like sales, taxes, low stock reports, abandoned shopping carts, and more - but can also be complex for beginners. \nShopify Plus\u2019s reports are easier to access and understand. \nSupport\n\nMAGENTO: Robust community support forums. 24/7 service through live chat, email, or phone.\n\nShopify Plus: Robust blog. Dedicated account Managers provide personalized assistance. 24/7 service with the Shopify Plus priority support phone number and email address. \n", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1455605057, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_44u3sm", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "aimatme219", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1458529127, "parent_id": "t3_44u3sm"}

{"id": "d02sqye", "body": "Yes, 100% fan of starting small. You can always start small.  \n  \nDepending on how much capital you have, here is what I would do :  \n  \nTalk to people in your local running club about products they are missing or that they pay a lot for currently. Ask people in person and online about those products. Pick one product that seems to be a common need that people either replace often, pay a lot for, or can't find elsewhere.  \n  \nMaybe sell shorts based on inseam size to begin with (I don't know the industry well, just spitballing as an example). Or, find a fabric that works really well for running. Be climate/season specific, if possible. You could probably just sell under armour fabrics at lower prices. The key is to start with one main product.  \n  \nThere's a good post by bonobos founder about this. I think under armour did the same thing, IIRC.  \n  \nYou can find good fabric suppliers through using customs records (or easier, tradesparq or import genius.. but those are more costly).  \n\nCreate a marketable brand around running. Don't spend a lot of time picking a name or a logo.  Find something with a .com available, if possible.  \n  \nFor example, I'd call it \"run layer\". The .com is available and it's pretty catchy (i.e. similar to base layer). \nTo be honest, I don't know how the .com is available. Pretty good name. Marketable.  \n    \nGet a nice logo. Nothing too fancy, simple. Just an R with some sort of enclosure should do. Use 4 Ls to make a rectangle around it. Doesn't really matter.   \n  \nFind a manufacturer that does small run sizes. Use makers row, or go to a trade show, or some old fashioned googling. Work with the manufacturer's current product line to private label their current offerings to reduce the need for new patterns to be made.\n  \nGet a small order, test them, make them better. Get feedback from customers. Get your customers to talk about you (NPS marketing). Find running clubs and offer them a direct discount code just for their members.   \n  \nCreate some designs for tshirts that are simple. Use printful or another service so you don't need to keep stock. \"Run Forever\", \"Run this town __(city name)_____\", \"The world is my track\".. Maybe get a designer to make some cheap illustrations, or find some stock illustrations. Any running quotes that get a lot of likes on instagram or pinterest, put it on a shirt with your logo.   \n  \nGo to alibaba and purchase some running belts.  Maybe some water bottles? Find products that are actually good quality. Now that you have a website, most suppliers will send you samples for free or just the cost of shipping. Add products that you would actually use.    \n  \nNow you have a signature product and some more stuff to fill out your offering. Make sure to have an active newsletter. Use shopify for your website. Get good product photography. You don't need to be a professional. Use instagram. Product pics, running pics, quotes, contests (\"run this path for a chance to win\").  \n    \n**Blog / Content marketing:** advice for runners, good paths in your city,  motivation. Stories about runners (humans of new york style? played out? I don't know).    \n  \nKeep releasing different/new fabrics. Get feedback from customers. Fabrics should be season/climate specific.   \n   \nThat's probably a decent business. More than a lifestyle business. From there, you can take it as far as you want to.  \n  \n  \n", "subreddit": "startups", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh26", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1455680585, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_46450f", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "9190vc", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1458548819, "parent_id": "t1_d02cwpe"}

Ou saltas fora ou arranjas os \"tomates\" para apresentar uma proposta e depois vais aprender. \u00c9 mega stressante e n\u00e3o podes falhar sen\u00e3o em vez de recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es vais ter reclama\u00e7\u00f5es.\n\n-Prazos, est\u00e1 para vir o primeiro projecto em que o prazo que o cliente pede \u00e9 o prazo real. A n\u00e3o ser que haja datas fixas como por ex, campanha de natal, se passa o natal j\u00e1 n\u00e3o faz sentido ent\u00e3o tem mesmo que ser. Todos os outros projectos t\u00eam derrapagem por culpa do cliente de 100, 200, 500%. J\u00e1 jogo com isso sen\u00e3o ia passar metade do tempo parado. Mesmo quando as coisas apertam nunca me deitei depois da meia noite e muito menos fazer 1 directa.\n\n*H\u00e1 um ou outro cliente chato com prazos, ex Sonae. Eles enviam um pdf com requisitos a todos os fornecedores, tens tipicamente menos de 24h para enviar proposta e depois escolhem o mais barato. E depois pedem mais x,y e z que n\u00e3o estavam na proposta e tudo para ontem.

People have different search styles so some may use the navigation bar or the search box...but some like to click on big pictures. \nHelp them get to what they want instead of hoping a random product catches their attention.  \n(*The Fashionopolism theme has the ability to incorporate category box links at the bottom of the slides \u2013 use it.*)   \n\n**\u2022 How can design help your store?**  \n&gt;Despite its blandness, the current design is too 'busy' and demands too much brainpower from the user. There's no clear hierarchy, the slides are not up-to-par with the quality of your products, links are styled the same as text so it's not clear that they're clickable, etc. Basically, usability sucks which leads to less trustworthiness\u2014which can be fatal to an online store.   \nWith customization, you can get a lot more mileage from the theme you're using.

{"id": "d063xmb", "body": "Have been a sneakerhead for a about a year. In that time, I've come across a lot of heart aches with releases. Bots are for sure one of the main reasons that people don't score with online releases. Bots have the capability to create an infinite amount of accounts, you just need a card and different proxy for each account. Bots are also a lot quicker than the manual \"Add to cart\" process, and manually typing in all of your information at checkout. There are also the issues of \"Back Door Access.\" Websites that use \"Shopify\" as their checkout service have the issue where people can add a shoe to their cart and checkout as soon as the online inventory is activated. These people don't have to go to the main page to add a shoe to cart. They just type in the backdoor link and the shoe is automatically added to their shopify cart. \n\nPhysical release - Even if you wait days in line, you still aren't 100% secured for a shoe. There are a lot of sketchy stores out there, and those stores will give to their employees and buddies before the customer. There was a story on here of a guy waiting in line for a shoe, and a reseller just kept going to the front of the line to buy several shoes, without anyone else getting a pair. The line essentially didn't even move, because this guy was just walking to the front and buying more pairs. \n\nReselling - this is caused by supply and demand. I have no idea why this has become such a large thing, when people could just get their retailers license and buy these exclusives for under retail.

If your buying from ebay and selling on amazon, or buying from amazon and selling on ebay, it violates their ToS rules. Not illegal per say but I wouldn't want to get in their bad books\n\nIf you buy from alibaba and re-private label it and sell directly on your own site or through amazon's portal and ebay, that's legal lots of people do that\n\n&gt;  And I want some advices how to start, I think I won't start for the begging directly with a website.\n\nI think you are confusing yourself with something. A website is only simply a medium for a business to reach out to people and possibly sell things.\n\nForemost, they are a vendor, manufacturer, or distributor. Some make their own products, some buy from manufacturers and resell it at a \"Wholesale\" costs to resellers such as yourself\n\nAlso, no website wants a beggar. Sales people from the vendor side want to know that you can create a return on investment for them. Basically, the vendor or whoever you're buying from wants to see if you know your stuff and what you're financial situation is in (E.G. what's your credentials like?)\n\n&gt; And can you give me some example what I need to put on my website and how can I make it legal !\n\nA website is simply a medium like i said. Behind a website is a business. A business needs to be registered with the government through whatever city you currently reside in. You can check out legalzoom.com or register your business (generally an LLC) yourself, or find someone local to do it\n\n&gt; When I'm going to deliver the shoes (this what i want to sell) do I have to make a bill for each pair or a receipt ?\n\nNormally an ecommerce site does this already. I'd suggest you look into shopify.com since its supposed to be easy to setup yourself for things like shoes and clothing. What you need to do is have an accountant to handle your IRS and taxes, and any legal paperwork needed. I'd suggest you google something like \"New York accountants\" or \"YOUR_CITY accounts\" and form a long lasting relationship with someone.

{"id": "d08jm71", "body": " \n \n **Author**:  _Keyare_ \n \n  **Content**:  \n \n  &gt;The past two months have seen a radical transformation in our software and identity. We've completely stipped down and redesigned our code, our purpose and with the launch of the new Syscoin 2.0 \"Shade\" wallet in the\nnext few weeks we are reshaping ourselves from a simple 'altcoin' to a Bitcoin enabling suite of applications complimented and powered by the SYS token.\nRather than building a \"walled garden\" and forcing everyone to use SYS to appreciate the fruits of that garden, we've enabled buying and selling\nwithin the SYS decentralized marketplace using Bitcoin.  Dust amounts of the Syscoin token (SYS) will be required to fuel the network and enable advanced features but most purchases can be made directly using Bitcoin.\nThis insulates merchants from possible volatility in SYS price and brings\nincredible value to Bitcoin users. Based on service utilization SYS fees may be burned rather than returned to miners- actively decreasing the SYS supply as marketplace usage increases.\n\n&gt;The new Syscoin 2.0 wallet features a built-in decentralized marketplace\nanyone can use to buy and sell goods and services without moderation,\npolitical interference, downtime, requiring hosting or even a 24/7\ninternet connection. If you, your business or friends have services you'd\nlike to offer in exchange for BTC/SYS/USD/etc those services can be\noffered, advertised, resold (if enabled) and procured all using the\nSyscoin marketplace.  Syscoin 2.0 also offers fiat-price pegging based on\ncurrent exchange rates. Now you can list your good or service priced in\nUSD/EUR/GBP/etc and know that upon sale you'll recieve enough SYS to\nconvert to the desired amount of fiat currency. Additional advanced\nservices such as Aliases, Escrow, Certificates, Encrypted Messaging and\nPrice Pegging are now included but are currently only available using the\nSYS token. Enabling these advanced features for Bitcoin are part of our\npost-hardfork plans.\n\n&gt;Future plans also include e-commerce plugins for major platforms such as\nShopify, Magento, Opencart and PrestaShop as well as integration options\nor import filters to use with eBay, Etsy and Amazon. Support for\nadditional altcoins will also be examined, and we'll be rolling out\nadditional wallet design improvements and mobile experiences as well.\nSyscoin is very similar to another open-source decentraized marketplace\nproject called OpenBazaar. OpenBazaar is a peer-to-peer service like\nbittorrent. With OpenBazaar your computer is required to be online 24/7 or\nanother node with a cache of your items must be online - if not, your\nitems are not visible for sale/purchase. Because the implementation is p2p\nbased rather than blockchain based, the anti-forgery mechanisms provided\nby the blockchain are not present in OpenBazaar. Some features such as\nencrypted messaging and escrow work differently in Syscoin as compared to\nOpenBazaar as they're secured by the network consensus mechanism within\nthe Syscoin network.\n\n&gt;Syscoin is an open-source blockchain based application. Every Syscoin\ntransaction, listing and encrypted message is persisted on the blockchain\nregardless of your connection to the internet. All information is secured\nusing SYS pub/priv keys and ECIES encryption by default. Syscoin does not\nhave private funding like OpenBazaar; instead we have passion. We have\nbeen building this as a product for the last two years for free. You can't\ninvest in OpenBazaar, but you can invest in Syscoin!\n\n&gt;The Syscoin 2.0 hard fork is slated for the beginning of March. Maximum\ncoin count will drop from 2 billion to 6.68 Million. For clarity we are\nreferring to them as SYS1 and SYS2 but the new token will continue to be\ntraded as SYS. Current SYS1 holders will have little to no issues\nswitching to SYS2. Current wallets will be compatible with SYS2 and there\nwill be no time limit on conversion. Exchanges will also automatically\nconvert all SYS1 to SYS2. We are working with exchanges to help them\nthrough this process. The conversion will operate on a simple ratio; 1\nSYS2 per every 299.4 SYS1. The fork will also switch Syscoin from a Scrypt\nalgorithm that is merge-mineable with Litecoin to a SHA-256 algorithm\nwhich is merge-mineable with Bitcoin (larger network, more security and\nstability). This gives our network much more bandwidth and scalability\ninto the future.\n\n&gt;More information at:  [---LINK--- ", "subreddit": "BitcoinAll", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_39m7n", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1456092146, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_46xjj1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "BitcoinAllBot", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1458648016, "parent_id": "t3_46xjj1"}

{"id": "d0di4xl", "body": "This is missing a serious tag, but whatever :)\n\nI'm actually writing a post about 250 ways to make money online, and while it's not done yet, I can still contribute some useful info.\n\n##Best $/Hour to make money right now\n\n**Usability Testing**\n\n* [UserTesting]---LINK--- $10 for a 5-20 minute video review of a website or app. You get paid for visiting websites or apps and speaking your thoughts out loud.\n* [Sticky Crowd]---LINK--- $.75-$1 for a 3-5 minute eye-tracking test. Requires access to your webcam, but very quick and painless. You just have to look at a couple images or watch a video with the webcam on.\n* [Play Test Cloud]---LINK--- $7-$9 for testing a browser or phone game. All tests take less than 30 minutes. You can only do this if you don\u2019t work in the games industry.\n\n**Mobile**\n\n* [Google Opinion Rewards]---LINK--- Get Google Play credit for taking short surveys provided by Google. Be honest when taking the surveys! From time to time they have questions that catch liars and you can get banned.\n* [NiceTalk]---LINK--- $10 per hour for speaking English with Chinese students using video-chat on your phone. You have to do a 30-60 second video recording of yourself speaking English and you find out if you got accepted in a couple days.\n\n**Tutoring**\n\n* [InstaEDU]---LINK--- $20 per hour and easy to sign up. You have to be a college student or older to tutor.\n* [SkimaTalk]---LINK--- Same idea as NiceTalk except this one uses your computer. Between $10-$18 per hour.\n\n**Crowd Working**\n\n* [Amazon Turk]---LINK---  Starts out very slow, but as you complete more and more HITs you get access to better paying ones. (As long as your rating stays fairly high.\nIt is possible to make a [full-time income]---LINK--- with this, but it takes a lot of time to build up your rating and complete enough HITs to get access to the higher paying ones. (I recommend checking out [this page]---LINK--- if you\u2019re planning on doing Mturk.)\n* Clickworker [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK--- Similar to Amazon Turk. The Clickworker website itself doesn\u2019t have that many great tasks, so you should join UHRS right as you register. UHRS is tasks for Bing that are pretty easy to do and some of the highest paying tasks can get you to $30 an hour. (On average you\u2019ll be between $8-$15 per hour though.)\n\n**Skill Based Games**\n\n* [Dollar Candy]---LINK--- 45 second skill-based game. You bet a certain $, play the game, and if you beat at least 3/4 people you make money. The lowest bet is 9 cents, but the minimum deposit is $3. I\u2019m pretty good at the game so I was able to turn my $3 into $28 in less than a week.\n\n**Cashback**\n\n* Ibotta [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK--- Unlock rebates, submit receipts and get money back. Use my ref link to get $10 when you use your first rebate.\n* TopCashBack [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK--- Get cashback for shopping online and offline. My favorite rebate site.\n\n**Get Paid to**\n\n* Swagbucks [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK---  Complete daily polls, go through daily offers, play games, and watch videos. Don\u2019t do the surveys as you\u2019ll get disqualified fairly often and the sites in the survey section pay more anyway.\n* CashCrate [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK--- Get money for checking in daily, taking surveys, and completing daily offers. Similar to Swagbucks.\n\n\n**Social Networks**\n\n* Tsu  [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK--- Tsu is a social network that shares 90% of its ad revenue with the users. You won\u2019t make a ton of money from it, but meeting new people is fun and why not get paid to do what you already do?\n\n**Other**\n\n* SliceThePie [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK--- Review songs or fashion items and get paid. The average income is usually between $4-$6 per hour which isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\n* PostLoop [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK--- Make money by posting in different forums. You have to make 10 free posts when starting out to prove that your English is good. Really spend some time on those posts and make them good. Otherwise you\u2019ll have a bad rating and you won\u2019t be able to make money with the site. $4-$7 per hour.\n* Prolific Academic [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK--- Help psychology students and professors do studies, and make money at the same time! Most studies are very short, but they pay an equivalent of at least $7 an hour.\n\n##Best ways to make money long-term\n\n**Affiliate Marketing**- Promote other website's products and make a commission every time someone buys something through your link.\n   \n* I made almost [$600 with Amazon Affiliate sites last month]---LINK---, and there are many great sites you could promote. \n* Groupon has an affiliate program. \n* So does Amazon\n* Walmart\n* Target, and more.\n\nI recommend creating a wordpress website for this so here's what you'll need:\n\n* A domain- I recommend NameCheap [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK---\n* Hosting- Either NameCheap [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK--- or BlueHost [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK--- as they have the cheapest hosting. They're not the best, but if you're just starting out their prices are great.\n* Paid theme *(Optional)*- There are great free themes out there, but  most of the time paid themes look better. I use ThemeForest [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK---\n\n**Write and sell an eBook**\n\n* [Amazon Kindle Direct]---LINK--- Publish your eBook on Amazon and get up to 70% royalties on every sale of your book. If you only publish your book on Amazon you also get more promotions and more sales.\n* [Lulu]---LINK--- Upload your eBook and they take care of the rest. They\u2019ll publish it on their store, Amazon, iBooks, nook, and Kobo. They take a fairly big chunk out of your income though.\nYou can also publish and sell a real book through them. I recommend starting with an eBook as it is much easier and has higher profit margins.\n\n**Create an online course**\n\n* [Udemy]---LINK--- Have an approval process for the course and they often have big discounts on courses. You basically get free traffic and promotion, but if you opt out of participating in the uDemy sales your income will be smaller.\n* [LearnWorlds]---LINK--- Has multiple plans, but always takes $5 per course sold. You can either pay $99 set up fee or pay $29 per month for additional features.\n* [Teachable]---LINK--- Has free and paid plans. Great platform.\n\n**Sell your stock photos/3d Design**\n\n* [iStockPhoto]---LINK--- - Take a quiz, submit 3 sample photos, videos, or illustrations, and get a minimum of 15% for each photo you sell. Becoming an exclusive contributor increases your royalty rate.\n* [Veer]---LINK--- The payment depends on the size of the downloaded image/illustration. You can get $.35-$7 per image. You need to upload 10 images for review before selling on their site.\n* [TurboSquid]---LINK--- Sell 3D models and get 40%-80% royalties per model sold. Your royalties increase if you sell exclusively on TurboSquid and if you take part in their affiliate program.\n\n**Video marketing**- Same idea as affiliate marketing except you're using video.\n\n* YouTube\n* DailyMotion\n\n**Online Store**- Create an online store and sell digital/physical products.\n\n* Shopify [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK--- The cheapest plan is $29 per month, but they provide lightning-fast hosting and other useful back-end options. They have some free themes, but the paid ones are all around $150.\n* Wordpress + Woocommerce- Free to use except for hosting and a domain, but you\u2019ll probably end up spending money on Woocommerce addons so the price will be similar to Shopify. This is great if you already have a WordPress site though.\n\n**Investing/Lending**\n\n* Kickfurther [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK--- Get a free $5 when signing up with my ref link. Invest in real businesses and get an average 10% return in 9 months.\n* /r/borrow - Short term and long-term loans to people in the reddit community.\n\n**Membership site** - If you\u2019re knowledgeable in something and you would love to help other people learn or succeed in the same niche as you, then a membership site is perfect.\n\n* S2 Member [ref]---LINK--- [non-ref]---LINK--- + Wordpress- A great plugin for creating a member site. You can use the free version with limited features or buy the more advanced version for $89.\n\n---\nI'm running out of characters, but I think this should give you guys a fair idea of how you can make money online.

But it's really best for larger more general audiences. Given you have such a niche market FB targeting could be really difficult. Alternatively, you could find a blogger who covers your type of product and invest with them to test the market. You could place ads on their blog that click back to your page. Ask them to review your product in a post and ask if you can pay them to send out a newsletter to their followers with a discount offer on your product. The idea here is that you are layering a message to a targeted audience through a third party influencer that is talking to your 1%. Given the price of your piece they won't just buy it because the blogger says so, but you're using that blogger's influence to validate the product.

What is a website based on almost dummy content worth to you?

{"body": "Hi thanks for the input. Let's start at the end and work our way back. SEO isn't really the first thing I look for in a potential purchase. I see that as a value add I bring to the table. What I'm looking for, and this is just me, is a site or app that has a good conceptual start.\n\nNow let's talk about the dummy content, site, etc... What I liked about this site is that they seemed to put quite a bit of effort into it. Now, it could be that there is some auto-generation script that pre-filled this site in minutes with inventory, images, pricing, etc... but it doesn't look sloppy (actually the Star Wars section feels not well done to me after taking a longer look). Since it's hosted on shopify my guess is that it won't take much to transfer. Moving an entire ecommerce site from one hosting platform to another is a chore, and not one I'm really up for right now. Add to that just finding a decent logo can take it's toll on a marketer so if I'm someone trying to do a side hustle project or add to my portfolio all the work that gets done first works in my favor, but that's just me. Think about a person buying a new car, some people test drive a car, buy it, and drive it off the lot as is while other people want to custom order their new car to make sure every aspect matches what they want. With so much done on this site if you're in the later category it may not be appealing.\n\nSo let's talk valuation. The price I list here for auctions is the amount of money I'm ready to lose, willing to spend. To me it's equivalent to the break-even point in a worst case scenario option like say I got really ill or just never had a lot of time to spend on this project. With the work done I think I could easily setup a social media campaign and sell t-shirts on this site to make that $3,500 back by the end of the year or at the very least run a PLA campaign to get that done. But that's not all Comic Book heroes are tending up right now and have been for years. Batman, Deadpool, Iron Man, Spider-Man, etc... and while the thing of the month might change, that trend isn't and I think we're a good 5 years from that happening. That leaves a lot of room to sell t-shirts and make a decent return on my investment, even if I run the site at a worse case scenario.\n\nNow that being said you could probably duplicate this site yourself if you had good brand in mind for under $300. It's all in what is valuable to you and your position. Remember something is worth whatever someone else will pay for it.\n\ntl;dr - the value isn't what I would make an offer on, but my ceiling if things went that far.

Shopify seems to not care for any of these preconceived notions. We've been taught you do A, B, and C and can legitimately expect Y. Shopify doesn't really expect you to do A, B, and C, which people feel fine with; but Shopify also doesn't deliver on the Y, which people feel they can legitimately expect.

There is a lot of great startup talent in Canada, and companies south of the border are realizing that there's a big opportunity to build satellite offices in those cities to tap into it, as well as increased VC interest, especially with the dollar being what it is. At the same time successful Canadian tech companies like Shopify and Hootsuite have committed to building great companies here at home, which is fantastic.\n\nWe are doing our best to build a great startup community here in Kitchener-Waterloo. We are in the midst of expanding the Velocity Garage in downtown Kitchener, where over 60 software, hardware, and science startups currently work out of.

In the end, we have no control over whether companies stay or leave, but we believe that as more companies grow and stay in the region, that density of startups offers more opportunities to collaborate, and increased resources within the community. More than 60% of startups that launch from the Garage stay in the KW community, while the rest tend to go to Toronto, the Valley, or elsewhere, largely because there's a need for them to be closer to their specific customers.
