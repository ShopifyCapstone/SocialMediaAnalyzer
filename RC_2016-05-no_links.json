Give me companies that compete in say oh that specialize in the retail clothing sector. The thing about USA is that they are competing like crazy even if it's in a sector that does not look lucrative.\n\nare you saying we're less innovative because we have fewer publicly listed companies in any sector? because that's not how I define innovation. Competition, yes. \n \nIt's should be obvious that having 10x the population that is more dispersed than Canada affords US the opportunity to have large regional players. 90% of Canada's population lives within a couple hundred km's of the US border that pretty guarantees that retail space becomes premium priced and that reduces the number of companies that can enter or survive or thrive. It takes the first mover very little to gain a scale that becomes tough to compete against..unless you bring something new to the market (like Walmart did)\n\nas far as public listings go, Canadian companies are far less likely to go public anyway because there is a strong 'family business' mentality here. \n\n&gt; As for frauding in general it tells me that it's only one of a few ways to get big in Canada.  Name me a company that has been truthful for it's entire lifespan and has become a multi-billion dollar ~~evaluation~~ valuation\n\nIn Canada? sure. Brookfield Asset Mgmt, Fairfax Financial, George Weston, Alimentation Couchetard, Loblaw, Metro, Empire, Sun Life, Manulife, Power Corp, Great West Life, Jean Coutu, ONEX, Dollarama, Rio-Can, All 8 big banks, Rexall, Maple Leaf foods, Saputo, Chobani Yogurt, Open Text, Computer Modelling Group, CGI, Celestica, Shopify, Tim Hortons, Fortis, Gildan Activewear, Canadian Tire, Magna, Linamar, CCL Industries, CAE, Magellan Aerospace, Progressive Waste, Ritchie Brothers and about 90 more\n\n&gt; Walmart last time around had some not so stellar earnings last quarter as being big and cheap doesn't equate to profit anymore.\n\nWal-Mart US did. [Wal-Mart Canada is outperforming it]---LINK---\n\n&gt; As for Nordstrom a few months is quite a bit of time to get adjusted\n\nyou don't seem to have a good grasp on this subject matter. It takes at least 1 year just to get a handle on seasonal demand, 2 years to adjust your inventory and ordering systems. HBC owns Nordstroms. I will bet you money Nordtstrom will be just fine.

If you're *not* technical, host at [Dreamhost]---LINK--- Used all three services; Pros/Cons with all of them, but they're great for most needs.\n\n**3:** If you're selling products, use [Shopify]---LINK--- They are hands-down the best way for most businesses to sell products online, if you're not going to hire a developer. \n\n**4:** If you're selling services, WordPress is fine. Although I have a professional bias against it, it works for what most people need. Be aware that you'll need to make sure you get a good theme; there are TONS of terrible themes that will drastically hinder your site's growth potential. Other options include Statamic, OctoberCMS, and Craft CMS. (Professionally, I prefer [Craft]---LINK--- for its performance and flexibility, but it's not for the faint-of-heart\u2014you'll absolutely need a developer.)\n\n**5:** If you're accepting payments *and* have a developer, [Stripe]---LINK--- is a great option. You can also use [Stripe Checkout]---LINK--- to accept payments without involving a developer. Another option is PayPal, but beware that they can (and will) freeze your account at any time for various reasons, and it's uncertain whether you'll get it back in a reasonable amount of time (or at all.) Definitely a buyer beware situation here.\n\n**6:** Hire a developer for an hour, and get them to add SSL to your site with [Let's Encrypt]---LINK--- It's free, increases conversions, and provides a small SEO boost in your search rankings. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.

Marketplaces like eBay/Amazon generate traffic for you, but you can integrate your Shopify store with them. So I would consider marketplaces as additional channels and not alternative solutions.\n\nTheme updates are easy to manage if you have your site (or theme) backed up regularly. That's a rule of thumb regardless of your platform. Worst case, you can download your Shopify theme and test the updated theme (you can have unpublished themes in Shopify) before pushing the button to publish live. No need to have your site down for any amount of time.\n\nThe platform is almost completely open. Apps just have access to the API and offer additional functionality. You don't need them for it's core functionality as an e-commerce platform. Most of what an app can do, you can do with custom code. It's definitely not built on apps. That being said, end-users don't always know how to code or have the money to pay a developer, so apps seem like a necessity.\n\nThe biggest complaints I hear from merchants are:\n\n**Pricing levels** - Shopify offers only one price, so if you're a wholesaler/distributor with multi-tier customers, it can be a shaky workaround.\n\n**Multiple discounts** - discount codes effectively cancel each other out. If you enter more than one, the last one cancels the first.\n\n**Free shipping** - Along the same vein as discount codes, if you offer free shipping over a certain amount and a customer enters a discount code that brings their total back under that amount, they'll get hit with shipping again. So if your total is $54 and you get free shipping for orders over $50 and enter a coupon code for $5 off, you get the $5 discount but shipping costs will get added back to the total.\n\n**Multiple currencies/multiple languages** - They aren't consistent and there's not a lot of support or response from Shopify on the matter.\n\nThese all have workarounds, but the lack of an out of box solution drives people nuts.

{"id": "d2tu4zr", "body": "CS vet here. My advice to new people getting into the field or studying is to learn a database language like Postgres or MySQL. Incredibly useful and always needed. \n\nAlso get really really comfortable in Linux or Unix. If you are using windows for your primary OS. Just stop. Install Ubuntu on a separate partition. Windows controls about 1% of the market. So unless you are going to work for Microsoft or a big game studio that has their own engine in DX. You're probably going to be using Linux for development. And if you are doing web development you most certainly will be using Linux for deployment. \n\n CS isn't a very deep subject. It is however a very wide subject with an ever growing pace. Where frameworks and languages are only lasting a few years before being over run by newer and shinier tools. Everything is moving towards the web and now engineers are expected to know a lot. Not just a programming language like Java that they teach you in college. You are expected to know Frontend, Backend, DevOps and Administration probably. That means\n\n**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Javascript. Frameworks like Angular 2, React, and good only jQuery. Alongside CSS precompilers like LESS and SASS. And CSS mobile frameworks like ionic and Bootstrap.  Not to mention the posibility of having to use some other weird markup language like XML or YAML. As well as testing frameworks like Mocha, Jasmine and JSunit. There was a lot of traction for people to try to \"fix\" javascript a few years back. Goolge made Dart. Microsoft made Typescript. And the clear winner today surprisingly is Typescript. \n\n**Backend Database:** A database manager like MySQL or PostgreSQL. And the possibility of on ORM like Django ORM, SQLalchemy or Doctrine.\n\n**Backend Programming language** pick one. PHP is the most widely used in older applications. From there you have a wide variety of frameworks. Fast and dirty Content Managers like Wordpress, Drupal, Magento, and Joomla have large communities. Mostly amatuer hacks rolling in the mud and making more work for everyone else. \n\n**PHP** does have quite a few healthy MVC frameworks like Symfony, Laravel and CodeIgnitor. And the super archaic obtrusively annoying Zend. Zend powers Magento and keeps this dead horse from dying. Because Magento actually makes money and other people money. \n\n**Ruby** only has one thing it can do. Rails. Rails is an MVC that powers a lot of sites like Twitter and Shopify. People that like Ruby on Rails or RoR as it's called only have one name in my opinion. Zealots. Like Scientology level 40 Zealots. If you do things the Rails way you can build things fast. If you try to do things outside of the rails way. You will be fucked. \n\n**Python**. So much to say about Python. It is a great language and encourages a lot of great coding practices. There is one great MVC in python. It's called Django. I love Django. There are a lot of micro frameworks in Python also. Things like Flask, Bottle, and Pyramids (which reddit.com is built on). But even the reddit devs said if they could do it all over again they would do it in Django. \n\n**compiled languages** There is plenty of stuff for Go, Rust, Java, C#, and C++ if you need type safety. (which you don't) Groovy on Grails has a lot of users in the Java community. Android of course is a huge thing for Java. Also Swift and Obj C for OS X.  C# still runs on .NET framework and is uber gross. \n\n**DevOps** This is too large of a subject. But in the Python community Gunicorn or uWSGI are the prefered gateways. NGINX has dominated Apache in the last few years. Even PHP guys are using it in place of Apache. Java still has Tomcat and Spring. Docker is the industry standard for deployment. But now things like iron.io and kubernetes are Docker managers. Having your app run on top of some sort of service that will restart everything if it goes down is handled by Upstart and System.D. System.D has a ton of controversy because it breaks the Unix philosophy. But Upstart is hated by everyone except Ubuntu's Canonical. From there caching your requests is a job of its own. Things like memecache, AWS Elastic Search. NoSQL horseshit like MongoDb and Redis where there is no relation to a record just an index. Pre compiled and compressed as far as it can go. Things like Varnish seemed like a good idea but are quickly disappearing. I also forgot to add Vagrant and CoreOS to the list of Docker like things. DevOPS is pretty endless. I didn't even touch Continuous Integration. Just google TravisCI. Sometimes testing is done at deployment also. Testing is a whole subject of it's own and pretty language/framwork specific. There are a few different methodologies on testing. Behavioral, Practical, Unit, Smoke, some new buzz word, etc. \n\nIt just fucking never ends dude.

{"body": "The ecommerce platform that you choose really depends on your requirements. There is no 'best platform' but rather whats best suited for you. You need to ask yourself some serious questions like what's your budget? The level of support you need. How much time do you have to work on the site. How long do you have to set it up. What feature do you need?\n\n In general there are two avenues you can choose. \n1) hosted - you can setup a site by yourself using something like Wordpress and woo commerce or hire a web development company to do it. \nYou can get away with creating something yourself or doing it cheap and nasty by hiring certain    Freelancers (there are got good freelancers to that will quote according to spec). However, doing it yourself or using cheap methods often results in headaches and problems. One of the main issues is upgrading your site, for customised solutions this can be very expensive. Wordpress tends to be easier to update but plugins can become a problem. Platforms like Magento are a lot hard and require specialised knowledge. \n\nIn general if your going to need a highly customised site this is the route to take but it's not going to be cheap and it's possible that you can use a managed solution and make it work the way you want. \nUsing any of GoDaddys option will be going down this route. I would steer away from their web builder and generally won't use a web hosts customised tools (the code usually isn't good and sometimes you can't export content making it hard for migrations. \n\n2) sass / managed - in this category the platform is part of the service. Depending on the provider you'll have full access or limited access. Any decent sass provider will let you access the HTML/CSS and have FTP access. This takes away the headache of hosted.  The saas provider will take care of server issues and have technical support available to guide you through their platform. Prominent sass providers  include Shopify, Big Commerce and Neto. Generally the base code can't be altered (unlike hosted where you can go crazy) and is propriety but they'll have an API and/or integrations. \n\nPersonally for my own purposes I would recommend Neto. It is feature rich with the team continually improving it. While you don't get to dictate features like in a hosted site chances are they've got what you need or are working on it. The API is freely available also should you need custom development. There's free themes and support on any integration they've made including exporting to eBay. I've stated with hosted and even made my companies first ecommerce site. Even now I maintains blog on Wordpress. I needed to call in an agency to further develop the website and it soon became an expensive process.  \n\nThese aren't categories as its a continuum and other  solutions emerge like cloud hosting. Companies like GoDaddy install the platform (such as Wordpress) for you and it essentially becomes a saas, similarly  some web hosts specialise in Wordpress installs. \n\nTell me more about yourself and I'll see if I can help you out.

{"body": "Most people are pretty understanding. I just explain how I'm a dealer for the manufacturer and people are pretty cool with it. I'm going into year 3 right now and I've only had a customer ask to cancel their order one time because it was \"time sensitive\".\n\nThey told me they were cancelling and going to buy from a more \"reputable dealer\" who had it in stock. I told them that's fine but if the dealer told them they had it in stock they were probably lying to them to get the sale. I'm tight with the owner of the company I drop ship and I knew for a fact that specific product was backordered for at least 2 months.\n\nSo two weeks later the customer e-mails me again saying the other dealer couldn't fulfill their order and asked if I could e-mail them when it was back in stock. I told them sure, and said if they didn't care about the box it came in I could get them one in 2-3 business days. Ended up calling the manufacturer who had just come back from an industry show and had that specific product on their show piece, I asked if they wouldn't mind shipping that part since they didn't need it for the show anymore. They said sure and 3 days later the customer had a the part he wanted, just came in a generic UPS box as opposed to a branded box.\n\nAs for damaged products, I ask for photos of the damage. Once they e-mail me the photos I forward them to my supplier, they verify it's their fault not the customers and ship them out a replacement that day. Since they ship from within the US replacement takes 2-3 days max. It's pretty rare. Over the last 2+ years I've had about 1000 orders, each order averaging 2.5 products, I've probably had to replace 10ish. Only one did the manufacturer say \"no-way. customer did it themselves\". Was pretty clear the customer probably dropped the product, then drove a nail through it to make the crack larger. That guy was a bitch to deal with.\n\nThe worst though was a guy who got the product, then did a chargeback.

Starting a business, or being a freelance developer, is not something to be taken lightly. It's a lot tougher route than just finishing a bachelors of science and signing on with an established company. Even if you find your current courses easy, I can pretty much guarantee that does not translate into being able to freelance in a short amount of time with minimal effort. \n\n&gt; I also want to know how likely I am going to be hired by just knowing how to make website and apps?\n\n**The following are based on my personal experiences as a contract LAMP developer. Take them with a grain of salt. Results may vary.** \n\nDepends. People with experience with Drupal, Wordpress, BigCommerce, Shopify, and other similar big name applications are pretty employable right now. If you have a solid portfolio of plugins for those platforms (or even contributions to the core) I can't imagine you would have trouble finding consistent work. It will obviously take some time to establish yourself in that way, and without a strong background in ApplicationX you will absolutely not secure contracts for ApplicationX. No one hires freelancers/contractors as \"entry level\" workers. \n\n&gt; because all of the classes that I need to take in the future do not seem crucial in my career (a lot of proof classes).\n\nThese classes make you a better thinker and more well-rounded employee. That is why they are required by most universities. I promise it is not just an arbitrary barrier for entry into upper division courses.

If you're using a third-party payment processor like PayPal, then you don't need to worry about PCI. \n\nAt the end of the day unless you are very technical or plan to hire someone to manage this for you, you're probably better off going with a hosted solution.", "id": "d2zypbm", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1462891719, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4iodwm", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1465758960, "author": "beley", "edited": false, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_4iodwm"}

It's disingenuous to act like \"check out my design\" and linking to imgur with a bigcartel site ready to go isn't an ad.  If you are showing off a design that you are willing to sell, you are advertising it.  Feedback posts are probably a more effective way to advertise/sell product on here then just linking to a random website.  \n\nMy suggestion is to have a weekly thread dedicated just to design feedback with no store links.  That way people that genuinely want feedback have a place to get it.  There's also less incentive for users flaunting the rules since they they can't link their store and won't have the exposure that they would get from a front page post. \n\n**Who should be able to post an ad?**\n\nAnyone should be able to post an ad BUT it should be cleared by the mods.  This might seem extreme (so feel free to ignore it) but I'd suggest banning all sale links that aren't approved by mods.  It would prevent situations like the one with the stolen design the other day.  It would allow mods to check the legitimacy of a store.  If scamming is a big issue, mods could even require personal info from advertisers.\n\n**Should there by any content limitations?**\n\nMight be a good idea to limit to reputable sites (known brands, bigcartel, shopify, etc.) or PayPal only for sale links.   \n\nPeople that are genuinely creating streetwear should be able to share it here.

I would keep things simple and the scope limited. Remember that the term MVP has the word \"minimum\" in there. I would first decide on one main thing to test. Are you testing whether anyone would buy your products online? Are you testing which categories of products sell the best online? Are you testing which price ranges sell the best? If you try to test too many things at once, you won't get good answers. 150-200 items seems like a lot for an MVP if your primary purpose is just to test it out. I would suggest starting off with a single category of product to test it out first.\n\nIf the stock Shopify styles are not to your liking, you can create your own (or hire someone to do it), or buy them from places like themeforest ---LINK--- There are other ecommerce players in the market as well that you can look at, including BigCommerce, BigCartel, Magento, WooCommerce (with Wordpress), etc.\n\nIf you already have a website, then I have a shameless plug for my company, which is currently in beta.

Your website can even be as simple as just a single webpage if you wanted. It does require the use of Stripe payments though, which you can sign up for during our onboarding process if you don't already have an account.

{"id": "d31h15a", "body": "Thank you for the questions! I'd be happy to answer them. The main goal of a large business is to integrate their platform into a single one. You don't want islands of information floating around. Updating one doesn't mean the other will be too. For this reason, knowing how the information flows is important. Adding a product, for instance, requires adding it on Stitch, publishing it onto Shopify (stitch functionality), and then making it look beautiful using Shopify. Stitch handles the rest (accounting, etc). But there's also the manufacturing process, but these are handled in my item master which I handle separately. Thing is, this is a one time thing, and once it's all done, it flows beautifully. When it comes to handing off this work to someone else, a clear operating manual will be CRUCIAL.\n\nAs far as functionality goes, and which platform to use, I went through at least 10 Q&amp;A's with potential candidates. With each one, I requested that a member of their technical team be present. The sales team will say YES to everything, which is exactly why the process is so dangerous. I knew exactly what questions to ask.\n\nI knew I wanted to use Shopify as my long-term e-commerce solution. Their platform is absolutely amazing and it's growing in advanced functionality quite rapidly. Shopify Plus would serve well when my business merits even more custom development.

Unless you're in a very specific niche a new entry in this market is likely to be drowned out in the background noise of internet marketing. Personally I say take baby steps. \n\nTry to nail down a niche. You may be the only jewelry store on your block right now, but on the internet you're on a block filled with a million other jewelry stores. Go in prepared to fight your way to the top. Test across your item categories one by one. Find the niche that sells itself and has a low acquisition cost and high margins. Press on that.\n\nFor your trial run, start with top selling products in 2 categories and A/B test. Use freely available vendors where possible and prototype your marketing acquisitions and sales flow before spending money anywhere. Aka use Shopify and market on social media.

I've seen people close down B&amp;M storefronts because of losses due to bad ecommerce investments.

We are still trying to figure Etsy out as it seems that yes, it is way too saturated.  With Etsy it seems that shops with more reviews have better results, which puts the newer shops in sort of a catch-22.  You can't get sales unless you have reviews and can't get reviews without sales.  I will say that Shopify is amazing and would recommended it to any ecommerce business, especially one in our industry.  The ability to design your website as well as all of the analytics it comes with is invaluable.  Although, we've not had much success with Etsy thus far, we still feel it adds value at little expense as it still gives us exposure.

I know that's a bit of a non-answer, but it's true. \n\nTo give a number: I would be hesitant to accept even a simple e-commerce job for less than $2.5k strictly because of the amount of time it takes to get the project going. There's a *ton* of details that need to be considered, and the time spent answering emails, researching solutions/plugins/themes - it adds up FAST. Projects can quickly add up to over $15k, but those projects are few and far between if your designated clientele is small (possibly very small) businesses. Small businesses typically have more modest needs, less strict design preferences, smaller budgets, etc. If a project looks like it'll take months (or more than $15k), I'd probably just refer them to somebody else because we'd very likely struggle to abide whatever timeline they'd need (because we're a smaller shop).\n\n&gt; If I need PHP or JQuery or whateevr I figure I can hire a programmer or just manage to fit some code in and make it work myself.\n\nE-commerce sites are considered one of the most advanced and nuanced \"types\" of websites - an order of magnitude more so than a blog. They can have severe legal consequences if created improperly (incorrect payment handling, insecure storage of sensitive information, etc) and can lead to a lot of harm. Unless you're: \n\nA) highly experienced at web development yourself, AND/OR\n\nB) able to hire a full-time developer or two to work for you, AND/OR \n\nC) going to build exclusively \"simple\" themed ecom sites on platforms like Shopify, \n\nI'd highly recommend against starting this type of a business for both your peace of mind and the sake of protecting clients' businesses. \"Just fitting some code in\" is going to be a lot harder than it sounds.\n\nWe offer simple sites for as low as around $500, with most projects ranging between $1k- 3k. Customer outreach is mostly word-of-mouth and networking, although we do get calls here and there from people who have seen our business cards in coffee shops and conferences and such.

{"body": "Alright well I have built 4 different affiliate/dropship websites where I sell other peoples products and I also help manage them so that might qualify me to answer this question at least somewhat - and this is the full drop of knowledge I've gained so far, hope it helps. One of them I own outright and the other three sites I work as a consultant but do most of the tech/website related tasks in addition to helping them with finances and etc. \n\nOne of them is WooCommerce/Wordpress and the other two are Shopify based. \n\n\n- I have a relationship with the vendors that allows me to use their images and content, but usually what I do is that I rewrite some of the content before it goes on the site. If the image is not available on the vendors website then I find it on the internet and reach out to the webmaster to ask if I can use the image. 9/10 they don't care and usually they just ask for a backlink which I'm totally willing to give them. \nI have two VA's from the Philippines who add products for me, and they are excellent. ($5/hour). Going to shamelessly plug [this guide]---LINK--- where I talk about hiring freelancers. \n\n- I don't have to deal with this problem because I ALWAYS do my due diligence when working with distributors from AliBaba/whereever else I source product from so thankfully I have never had an issue with distributors. The ones that do sell fake products, at least in my experience, are very open and are willing to tell me that the products are \"replica\" or \"non authentic\". If you have doubts... order a sample. If you still have doubts - just don't use them. \n\n- I picked the suppliers based on my niche. Not sure what you mean by this question, do you mean how do I vett the good from bad suppliers? \n\n- I started a Limited Liability Company and since I'm from AZ the information was incredibly easy to fill out and available directly from the [AZ Corporation Commissions Website]---LINK--- For taxes I have all the sales run into Quickbooks using the ZapStitch/Pipemonk Shopify Plugin: ---LINK--- and then let my accountant access that info at the end of the year for taxes. I don't think an LLC is necessary until you get serious but you should talk to a tax accountant if you have questions because this will vary from state to state and country. \n\n- I have [basic plans on Shopify]---LINK--- for both my stores because the gift cards feature isn't that important and neither is the reporting because I integrate all stores with Google Analytics. Quickbooks records the sales. The 14 day free trial helped a lot. It helped me get familiar with the platform and pick out a theme. During this time I highly recommend that you try to at least get some traffic to your site to test the idea and see if you can convert any visitors to sales. It's a lot easier to pay the monthly cost when you know that right off the bat you got a sale that will cover the cost for the month. \n\nYou can sign up for a free trial here:\n\n---LINK--- - (Aff. Link)  \n---LINK--- - (Non aff link because you hate me)\n\n- It depends on what you're selling. One of the sites is huge with over 800 products, for that one I use Wordpress. It's a heck of a lot more to learn and get setup but if you have 800+ products you better get seriously committed in the whole project because you'll be spending a LOT of time importing product info if the data doesn't come in a .csv (prepare for a lot of $$$ spent on your freelancers or a lot of hours doing it yourself). You also have a ton to learn going that route. With Wordpress you have a lot more control and flexibility but as I said above it's so much more to learn and get comfortable with. If something breaks on Wordpress you have to reach out to the theme developer and hope that they reply or else you're SOL (Or, you go back to UpWork and make another job posting for a guy who may or may not be able to fix it.) \n\nDid this help?

{"body": "That's too much of a gamble IMO even with a subscription type service. Cost to make the site is say 2k, customer pays 200/month. If they cancel before 10 months, you lose money. If they go over, great you're making extra. Would have to sit down and crunch the numbers to see if it's viable. Would require some stream lining of the development process but any type of standardization would narrow the market available. \n\nSince we are in /r/web_design I assume the offering would include custom design, again what would stop the client from using the service for a month and hiring someone to copy the design? Or is this supposed to be like a high end wix,weebly, shopify ? Were the customer makes their own site through simple customizations? Or maybe it's like those but you hide the editor from them (you use it and deliver the site ).\n\nI assumed it would be on reseller accounts or if large enough it would be on a dedicated server with a WHM/CPanel setup. There might not be much support but there could be quite a lot. IF the client can't reach the website, they will contact/call/email you for support. Could be lots of phantom support calls, things you can't resolve and the customer's just being a tad dense. Has happened and will continue to happen. \n\nHere's the biggest problem with reseller hosting. Imagine there's a problem with the server and it has to be physically restarted. You can't do it remotely, you have to get someone at the data center to walk in and restart the machine. How long do you think it could take to have that done? That would be frustrating enough but add to it there's customers emailing/calling you about it.\n\nThere's designers/developers who offer hosting without major hassles. It's something to look into but you should be aware of what offering it entails.

Running a Shopify shop of your own is one thing, but successfully operating an online marketplace of your own is an *extremely* involved undertaking with complex technical, legal, and logistical issues.

{"body": "So I am going to break it down into 3 parts to make it easier for you.\n\n1) **Domain name** (i.e: facebook.com, google.com, hospii.com)\n\n2) **Server** (this is what you run your website on)\n\n3) **Website** (this is where you design your website)\n\n\n\n**Domain name**\nThis is where you decide what you want the users to type to visit your website. You register the domain name that you want. You basically pay an annual fee to \"rent\" the name\", as long as you pay for the domain no one else can take it. But as soon as you let it expire and stop paying for it, it is up for anyone to \"rent\".\n\n**Server**\nThis is what your website is hosted on, so what is really important here is choosing the right server for you. You also want to make sure that the server you choose has a great uptime (you don't want a website that goes down frequently).\n\n**Website**\nThis is the section where you can design your website using html, css, javascript, etc. Or you can use a CMS like Wordpress, Drupal which is very standard for someone starting.\n\nFor what you are doing, I would recommend buying a domain name + server from dreamhost (I personally had good experience with them, but there are numerous options like bluehost, 1on1) and install Wordpress on it. Google some themes you like and play around with it. To start selling stuff, I recommend Woocommerce, it's very easy (there is also shopify, which has a lot of great themes as well). \n\nFeel free to PM if you have any questions.", "id": "d3cf03d", "subreddit": "startups", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh26", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1463709194, "author_flair_text": "Seasoned Entrepreneur", "link_id": "t3_4k5d6t", "author_flair_css_class": "", "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1465973652, "author": "clee_hospii", "edited": false, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_4k5d6t"}

{"id": "d3ci4sb", "body": "Some advice. \n\nI work in IT - Security and make ~100k a year in Texas, cost of living is low, property is inexpensive. My personal lively-hood is very well taken care of by my trained profession. When I opened up my shop I had ~20k saved up over the past couple years, and a couple of really good friends as well as a small starting player base who really desired a more 'positive' place to play. This business of mine is not my lively-hood, I am privileged in this regard and treat the store as a community hub catering to what the players want. By players for players yadda yadda. \n\nI saved a lot of money by finding property that wasn't exactly the best, but extremely inexpensive because I put fourth the hours and labor to fix it up. I have 3 employees, all are paid $8.50, and I plan on increasing that to $10 by next year depending on how the rest of this year goes. \n\nI started off slow, only purchased what I really needed for FNM, drafts, Commander etc. Eventually I was selling out faster than I could purchase and I had to pump a little more money into the shop to keep up with demand. I manage all the back-end projects while my guys take care of the shop day-to-day. Obviously the biggest benefit has been having a positive environment and pleasing both my employees and community. \n\nPayroll: I use Waveapps for direct deposit, it's ight, gets the job done. Has some pretty cool tools for monitoring your revenue stream gains/losses,\n\nTime: The guys who work for me are on a pretty normal schedule of 45 hours split between them. I really do want to increase this, but it all depends on what happens this year. \n\nPoint of Sale: I detest crystal commerce, was burned pretty bad by them and went with an alternative on Shopify. Provides all the tools I need, and has some awesome reporting features. I email invoices to out-of-state customers, build quotes for big-customers and try to maintain as much professionalism as possible. I have shopify on my phone when I'm around town, invoice creation for out-of-band customers, and then a simple Ipad at the shop with a Shopify reader. All of it connects in one pretty simple ecosystem, also integrates Facebook and other needs I have for SEO. \n\nDistribution: WoTC, Primary, Peachstate Hobby, Secondary. Wizards has pretty good prices vs my distributor, but distributor offers 1 day shipping at a flat rate, where as Wizards is up to 3 business days. Make sure you get a good account manager, get on a first name basis with you guy/gal and they'll take care of you. Sure it's all gaming, but it's still a professional business and they want to please you. \n\nWPN Status: GET THIS IMMEDIATELY. 30-40% of new faces in my shop have been directly from locator.wizards.com, people use it all the time for finding events. As soon as you get your WPN staus approved, get used to Wizards Event Reporter, it'll be your life in regards to Wizards events. \n\nAds: Facebook ads go a long way, I spend $200 a month or so on Facebook ads for events, and they really go a long way for revenue. Wizards publishes many kick ass articles on how to increase marketing, I suggest paying attention to them.\n\nPrices: Charge what you need, but get a feel for other shops in your area, provide some value added benefit if you can for customer's buying boxes. (We give our customer's little charms, super cheap but it goes a long way. Sometimes we'll provide free entry to an event etc.) \n\nEvents: What are you going to do to make your players want to show up vs other stores? This is where creative thought comes into play, be unique but positive. Make your shop your player's 'second-home'. \n\nIt took me roughly 6 months to stabilize, and took me 4 months to hit Advanced. This is extremely fast and not the norm, but I'd like to believe it's because we're respectful courteous provide excellent support, and really listen to our player's needs. Not to mention, me and my staff are players, so we actively participate in events  that WPN allows us to. Being a store owner and sitting down playing Commander/Standard helping others deck-tech or anything really goes a long way and makes your business all the stronger.\n\nPlease note, that while this business of mine sure is a hobby, it should still be taken very seriously as an investment. Make sure you check all the boxes before jumping in, feel free to PM me if you'd like any advice, I had to learn things the hard way as other LGS owners have before me.

One of the pro's of doing shipping this way is you can charge a little bit more for west coast users. Because shipping to west coast is just more expensive if you are on the east coast, and vice versa. Then you just add the specific states to that zone.\n\nIf you have multiple zones, west coast/east coast, then you would just duplicate your shipping weights, and then increase the price to what it costs you to ship there.\n\nI use Shippo as well, that app is a Godsend. But it will help you with shipping rates.\n\nEdit: also forgot to mention, when you weigh your product, add .10oz for shipping supplies.

{"id": "d3h1by3", "body": "Look into sales funnels. You can use this email list to find out who your most valuable customers are if you use the right tools and pay attention to relevant analytics. \n\nI recommend using Mail Chimp if you're just starting out, but Campaign Monitor is a step up. Without trying to sell to these customer just yet, you want them to like your emails. Provide concrete *value* in a couple of emails by sending, for example, blog posts with how-tos, DIYs, freebies, for things that make sense for a customer of yours. Sell clothes? Include an outfit of the week that has your stuff and other brands' as well. Make them feel like you have true value for them. Shopify does an amazing job with their blog for entrepreneurs.\n\nOnce you choose your email provider and start sending emails, look at the data. Who is opening the most emails? Who then is clicking the links? As you send a few emails, you'll start to see who your more \"valuable\" customers are based on these actions. You can get separate your 5,000 people into, let's say, 3 segments. The ones who never care about your email, the ones who open and leave, and the ones who click everything. \n\nOnce you have your three tiers of customers, make a plan for how to get them to like your emails, with the end game of converting on your website. Someone who always clicks is likely to be more open to being sold to. Try sending them product deals. The ones who open but don't click it need some more convincing. Perhaps include your compelling company story in the body of the email, and open up a little bit. Be humble and funny, and don't ask them to open a link. Just make them think that you're there and ready to come to your site soon.\n\nFinally, with those who have never clicked, well there's no easy answer, but keep trying, and come at it with a true plan. Try to figure out what these people have in common \u2013 similar products they purchase, frequency of products, etc. \u2013 and use that to somewhat infer what you could do to appeal to them.\n\nThe funnels that I mentioned at the beginning are just that. You start with a 5,000 person funnel, get down to 3,000 people who open it, and then 100 people who click. Of those 100, 1 person will buy, perhaps. Once you master growing that 100 (i.e. widening your funnel), then focus on converting them better on your website.\n\nI run a online shoe startup and email marketing is big. I started it from nothing in college and this has been a great way to acquire and keep customers engaged. Automation is helpful, but the fact is, when you send personalized emails, results are far better. That's what the tiered system adds a layer of personal touch.\n\nI hope this helps. I'm sorry that I didn't read it back over, please let me know if you have any questions about the jargon or anything in general!", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1464045933, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4kp8w0", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "ups": 2, "author": "TheOneBehindIt", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1466053348, "parent_id": "t3_4kp8w0"}

Our requirements mostly centered on multi store inventory management, reporting, and ease of use for POS. Oh and we strongly preferred cloud solutions so that we didn't have to stretch our IT hours managing a system and worrying about the liability of security.\n\nWe looked at a number of products, Vend was our #2 but couldn't do multistore integration with Stitch. Stitch became our pick for inventory because it can integrate with Amazon and Shopify for our online store. Stitch integrates with Square pretty well, so that made our selection easy. \n\nWe also looked at other products that had inventory, online, POS, all in one, but in the end they didn't fit us as well and did one of those poorly. \n\nBy selecting best of breed for all our needs and then integrating them we kind of get the best of all worlds and meet our needs well.\n\nThis will be our third POS in 6 years, and the first time we actually spent time demoing and worked hard to pick the best option. Our first POS was hard to use, overly complicated, and difficult to support. Our second POS was Mac based and chosen as a snap reaction against the first one. POS was much simpler but the software was buggy and their support was abysmal to fix the problems. Reporting was not up to par and managing inventory was a pain.\n\nHaving that history of doing it poorly, I think this time will be better and longer lasting. Part of choosing Square, Stitch and Shopify was a decision to pick major players, not niche players, and modern web based design with APIs vs legacy monolithic software. \n\nWe will be rolling out the change over this summer.

We released this feature in the last weeks, and we realized the use case of sending an email without a tracking number was something very useful. We should fix this in the next couple of days (maybe today :P).\n\n&gt; I don't believe the user has any way to look at the current status of an order, like they can on shopify, for example.\n\nA customer can see his order history via the [customer dashboard]---LINK--- there's also a way to add a link in the email the customer receives upon a purchase to see its order status. [Related documentation here]---LINK---\n\n&gt; The orders dashboard didn't really make it immediately clear to me what orders are outstanding and need actioning.\n\nAt the moment, when an order comes in it has the 'Processed' status in the dashboard. It means it's a new order that needs to be handled by the merchant. We'll definitely keep this feedback close when we review order management though! Stronger visual segmentation / cues could come in handy.\n\n&gt; For testing, it doesn't seem possible to disable the check that ensures the price hasn't been modified. This makes local development trickier.\n\nGood point! This is something we think about adding in the future. For now, we wrote this post, that can be useful to develop locally: [Develop a Snipcart Powered Website Locally Using ngrok]---LINK---\n\nIt's very useful when you want to work with our Webhooks also!\n\n&gt; I don't remember clearly, but I think shipping pricing was fairly simplistic. I want to be able to set a shipping price PER PRODUCT and also an additional item price (i.e. 2nd item of same product should have a (smaller) additional shipping cost).\n\nOur custom shipping rates are basic at the moment; we do want to improve them. However, we added a Webhooks Shipping API a few months ago that can be very powerful for more specific shipping calculations. Might be overkill for some use cases, but you can have full control on how shipping is calculated.

If it helps others to know that it really is possible, I was able to do something similar...\n\nI'm stopping out of college right now to work on a company I started, and started making websites for local small businesses to pay the bills. Totally recommend it. Honestly, if you walk into local shops/small businesses, many of them don't have websites. That's what I've done. They don't care if you custom code it. Squarespace and Shopify can be great, really. Come in, ask if they're interested in having a website/reaching more customers.\n\nIf they're receptive, feel out what their budget is. I've done $300 and $10,000. Based on what you want to charge, create an hourly rate, and work backwards in being able to defend why you will charge what you do. For example, say, I charge $50 an hour and it will take ten hours to make this website \u2013 2 hours for creating the sitemap and ideation, 3 hours for image layouts, tweaks, 4 hours for writing copy, and one for domain setup. If they want to pay less, don't offer to bring your rate down.

Basically you're telling me you can reinvent the look, be the best, be unique. I suggest you play to your strengths, instead. Your prices are low, you're small, you know exactly what you're getting. I can tell that when I open this that it's not a big, established brand who will reinvent my look. However, that can be a good thing. Bonobos had a very simple mission statement: pants kind of suck, we'll make it a little better. Be honest with it; these types of products *can* be found elsewhere. However, yours are all on the same site and \"curated.\" For example, you can say that you have a small number of tie styles on sale because you focus on design type rather than quantity. Tell me exactly what your company is, not what you want me to think it is.\n3. Pricing \u2013 Everlane tells customers what it costs to make and why they sell it for a given price. They do this to expose big brands' markups. It appears you have very competitive pricing, and if you take an approach like this, it could help acquire customers. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, I suggest at least saying why they are in the price range that they are. Is it \"low-cost, casual, not meant for the long haul\" or \"high-quality, direct-to-consumer that results in saving\"?\n4. I say all this because I like the designs \u2013 I'm a fan of knit ties, and have been looking for a new, young tie company. Keep at it. I think you have a cool look. Just look to be honest with your copy/customers. Don't worry about not seeming like the best company in the world. \n\nCongrats on your venture, and good luck!

I find this\namusing, in particular because TIOBE already showed a decline\nPRIOR to that AFTER the rails hype. Yet ruby did not die at all.\n\nSo how does he account for this in his fantasy lala land?\n\n\"All communities face fragmentation at some point\"\n\nThis is the biggest problem - the comment that the rails community\nis the same as the ruby community.\n\nThat was NEVER true, not even 10 years ago.\n\nI have no idea why some people keep on stating so.\n\nYes, there is a partial overlap but it is not a complete overlap\nBY FAR.\n\nThese are just huge different use cases.\n\n\"It's very difficult and expensive to maintain cohesiveness for a\nlong time.\"\n\nThere is no \"cohesiveness\" - there is not a single community either,\nso how can there be any cohesiveness anyway?\n\n\"The only community that I think achieved that through sheer\nforce of regulation is Microsoft's .NET stack.\"\n\nOh ... ok.

This is a project that I have been working on for about a month and it's stable enough to start actively recruiting clients to use.\n\nThe concept is very simple, you define a set of rules to increase or decrease a customer's score. An example would be \"If customer is greater than or equal to 365 days old increase score 100\" and can be as complex as \"If customer email ends in '@hotmail.com' decrease score by 10\". This is handy to see what customers score high. You take that list, say all customers with a score greater than 100, and send very targeted marketing material. Offer 10% off coupon or announce a new product or sale. It's up to you.\n\nFuture iterations of this product will include even deeper analytics.

Would love to hear what you used it for, and if it was useful.\n\nAn ecomm platform. It was useful, but also painful.  Its not an easy product to work with, but it does work.  You won't have to re-solve ecommerce problems on your own.\n\n&gt; Should I look at other Rails e-commerce frameworks besides Spree? I've heard of Solidus, but I'd like to hear directly from people who've worked with Spree &amp; alternatives\n\nHaven't used them.\n\n&gt; I'm thinking of using Angular Material on the front end. Is it easy to do this with Spree, which by default uses Boostrap+React?\n\nI'm not really sure.  I haven't used the more recent versions of spree to be able to give you a really good picture here.\n\n&gt; How easy is it to rewrite views in Spree? I'd like to do a ton of view customization, so this is important to me.\n\nSame as previous answer.  Older versions of spree were difficult to customize.\n\n&gt; Since I expect no users in the beginning, I figured I could launch a basic custom app (and maybe even manage orders initially at first), and then transition to a Spree app. Any advice on doing something like this?\n\nWhy do this?  Why not just use Shopfiy or something?  \n\n&gt; I've only ever seen examples of Spree used as a 'storefront' for retailers, and never as a pure e-commerce site (like Amazon or Jet, for example). Any reason why this might be the case?\n\nI suppose it depends on your definition of \"pure e-commerce\".  But I suspect its more about the industry.  Pure e-commerce sites now are moving towards things like Amazon Fulfillment or ShipWire or other logistics-as-a-service companies where you don't manage inventory directly.
