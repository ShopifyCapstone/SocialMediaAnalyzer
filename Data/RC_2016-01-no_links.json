{"id": "cyiiq8f", "body": "Congrats on your current success. \n\nI think running a dedicated e-commerce store would likely make sense in your situation. Like you, I don't like being economically dependent on Amazon or one other provider. There's always a chance they could close your account.\n\nHere's my 2 cents on ecommerce.\n\n1) Shopify is amazing. I've had other ecommerce stores, and Shopify was the best for me. All the hard or tedious parts were removed and they have a solid product offering. Templates are expensive and not as plentiful as Wordpress, but templates are also much less expensive than a custom solution.\n\n2) Before you do anything, I'd recommend doing keyword research. Find all the long-tail keywords that are both relevant and easy to rank for. While you're building a dedicated shopify store, build a blog to go along with it (Shopify has an integrated blog that works great). Make blog posts that tie to your keyword research. This will be your low-hanging fruit. \n\n3) Get a paid mailing list provider like AWeber or Mailchimp. There are plenty of great options. I use Mailchimp but all the major ones are pretty good. The higher the Lifetime Value (LTV) of a customer, the more you want them on your list. If you have a very high LTV, focus on getting them on your list and less on actually making a sale. \n\n4) When building the Shopify website, try to minimize the # of steps a customer has to take in order to make a sale. Have a call to action prominently displayed on your front page and fewer required fields to get payment processed.\n\n5) I highly recommend learning the basics above yourself. No coding knowledge is necessary. Once you've masters the stuff above, you can outsource a lot. Maintenance is pretty simple.\n\nGood luck. The process can be very rewarding if you do it all right.", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1451677184, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3z19v4", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "ups": 2, "author": "arindale", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1454219934, "parent_id": "t3_3z19v4"}

{"body": "Shopify is a hosted eCommerce platform. Their main competitors are Big Commerce and to a smaller degree Volusion. With Shopify you pay a monthly fee (starting at $30) and they take care of the hosting and most of the technical stuff so you can focus on building your store. If you want additional features you have to pay for them in their app store. Think of it like getting an iPhone. You get basic features out of the box but have to download apps if you want additional functionality.\n\n\n**Reasons NOT to Use Shopify:**\n\n* You don't get 100% control of the site. You're depending on Shopify Rules. If they decide for whatever reason that your store violates their policies, they can remove your site (unlikely)\n\n* It's not 100% customizable. You can make tweaks but again you're restricted to Shopify terms\n\n* It can be expensive. Their basic plan is $30/mo but you'll need to buy additional apps which can range from $0-$50/mo\n\n**Reasons TO Use Shopify:**\n\n* It's easy to get up and running fast.\n\n* If you're not a technical person, you don't have to worry about hosting, fixing bugs updates\n\n* The themes and apps as well the community is growing.\n\n* They have everything you need to start an online store including integrated merchant accounts (accept credit cards)\n\n=======\n\n\nWP is a CMS and you need to get your own hosting (around $6/mo). You have to install it and maintain it. (Not hard). With your own hosted solution like WP you can do whatever you want. You can install plugins, you can customize the theme and you can even make your own plugin.  WP woocommerce is one many self hosted eCommerce solutions. Others include Magento. Prestashop, Opencart and a few others. Prestashop is ok but apps are expensive. OC is poorly developed with lots of useless stuff and it sucks for SEO. Magento is awesome but it's way to big and complicated to use. WC offers the perfect balance of cost, value, customization and ease of SEO.\n\n**Reasons NOT to Use WooCommerce:**\n\n* You have be a technical person to setup and install WooCommerce. It's not hard but you still have to know what you're doing\n\n* You have to get your own host. \n\n* You're responsible for backing up the site, fixing bugs, keeping everything updated (this is a pain, even if you're a developer)\n\n* You have to setup the site, get an SSL, Setup a merchant account. Again not hard, but it's work.\n\n**Reasons TO Use WooCommerce:**\n\n* You can do ANYTHING you want. If you want a very custom theme or plugin, you can develop it yourself and pay someone to do it\n\n* It's cheap to operate. You pay for hosting, an SSL, and a few plugins. Total annual is usually under $200\n\n* No rules to follow. You can sell whatever you want, however you want.\n\n===\n\nIn the end it comes down to this: If you want 100% control and feel you can handle the technical side of things then use a self hosted solution like WooCommerce. IF you prefer not to have to worry about the technical work and you just wanna focus on building a store, then go with a hosted solution like Shopify.\n\n\n", "id": "cyjvjtj", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "edited": 1451784176, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1451783955, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3z6pwi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 6, "retrieved_on": 1454243364, "author": "shanu41", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 6, "parent_id": "t3_3z6pwi"}

{"body": "Among other reasons, this why I have a shopify store. Costs $30 a month for a basic store, plus some technical know-how and a bit of graphic design work to set it up. For no extra fee, once you're approved by the relevant sites (not difficult unless you're selling something that they frown on), they push your listings to both Facebook and Pinterest. Good photos are critical to selling on either, but it does work. The Pinterest buyable pins and Facebook listings come complete with \"buy\" buttons on both. IIRC they're also working on something with both Twitter and Amazon.\n\nAdd a $9 a month subscription to Inkfrog, and some initial setup, and with a few moments of mouse clicking, I can also sync the Shopify store with eBay. This means that if someone buys an item anywhere -- eBay, Shopify, Pinterest, or Facebook -- within a few minutes my listing quantities update everywhere and/or get cancelled or zeroed out, as appropriate to the sited. (Err, you do want to keep on top of the Inkfrog sync between Shopify and eBay, but it works well enough MOST of the time.)\n\niirc they're working on connections with Twitter and Amazon, too.\n\nManually promoting your stuff on social media takes a bit more labor, but for high dollar amounts it is worth it. Facebook has groups dedicated to buying and selling stuff and it's worth your time to seek them out. Mind the rules, as each group has different rules -- one of the better doll selling groups, for example, allows no outside links, so if I want to sell something there, I can't link to a listing in one of my other stores (not even the Facebook store I run.) I can just post a photo and say, \"Who wants it?\" And see if there are any takers. \n\nInstagram, as NeedAmnesiaIthink suggested upthread, is also a possibility. I understand it's a good site for selling. Unfortunately, I live in a remote area where cell phone connections are sketchy and I haven't yet figured out how to use it without a reliable smart phone.

{"body": "* Multisig/escrow is darn neat, but you can do that on any DNM. We don't call those Bitcoin projects. They are just stores. Moreover, you can replicate any of these features on a Wordpress+Woocommerce installation. Wordpress+Woocommerce isn't a Bitocin project. You can also accept and use Bitcoin's many features on centralized platforms like Magento or Shopify or through Ebay with Paypal. If OB is a Bitcoin project, then so is Ebay, Shopify, and Magento. The only thing that makes people think OB has anything to do with Bitcoin is that they use it for advertising.\n\n* Merchant-IDs in the blockchain are pointless. So what? There is no counterparty risk in merchant IDs. And that could be as simple as making a merchant-ID a public address. This is not a OB innovation, it is a Bitcoin innovation.\n\n* Using proof of burn to gain trust... this isn't in any way relevant. It's a protocol, and this is a proposed economic system endemic to the protocol. The notion that those with the most to gain (scammers) but who need the platform least, would not be willing to burn, but those with the least to gain but who need the platform most (small, new businesses who are trying to see if there is a market for their product) would be willing to burn to create profiles, is absurd. The idea here is to prevent sybil attacks. But calling something Spam is a judgment that shouldn't be made at the protocol level. That is why http doesn't ban spam, but Google and webrings let people sort around and through it.\n\n* Decentralized p2p rating system is a cute idea. I have read Dr. Washo's proposal numerous times, and I think it's a lot of words, nothign interesting, and almost nothing peer to peer about it. Also, this rating system has nothing to do with Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; For actually working with bitcoin one has to run a server (always on pc) aswell, to keep up with the blockchain.\n\nThis isn't true at all. Other people run full nodes, you do not have to. Even still, this is not the equivalent of running an OB store. A full node is a copy of everyone's accounts on the B/C. An OB node is not, it is just your store, and a way to connect and route to peers so you can find stuff. If your bitcoin node goes down, the network isn't even slightly damaged. If your OB node goes down, your entire store goes with it.\n\nAs to why OB won't work? It provides absolutely 0 efficiency over the current system. It doesn't work over http, it uses UDP. So you can't link to products or benefit from Google crawling your store without a huge amount of rigmarole. A person has to have the alternative OB client installed on their machine to make it work. In the way that children had to host their html experiments on their home network in the early 90s, you will have to host your own OB store on your home computer. If your traffic is too much for your local service to handle, you will have to put it on a third party platform. So while OB developers like to claim that the network isn't censorable, they are not saying who it is censorable from. Right now, they're claim is that etsy, ebay, amazon, and the like can kick you off their platform. That's all well and good, but then you can go and start your own website if you would like. The cost to move from their platform to your own is virtually 0. Bitcoin works because it is censorship resistant from governments. It wouldn't be considered censorship resistant if the censorship resistance was limited to Ebay. It also wouldn't be interesting. You would be laughing at Bitcoin if it were claiming it's censorship resistant to Ebay and that's why it's cool. That's what OB is claiming, because they know there is no governmental censorship resistance. Whether you advocate full censorship resistance or not, the reason Bitcoin or Tor or the internet itself are so interesting is because they are permission-less, not because they are standing up to the great, evil powers of Ebay or Amazon. The tech only works if it's censorship resistant to everyone.", "id": "cylxag5", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1451940474, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3ze9u3", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1454278819, "author": "junseth", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_cyloen3"}

Haven't logged in for awhile and so I just saw this. \n\nEverything is set up correctly and I'm familiar with the batch shipping process. New orders are real easy to deal with. I love shippo for my regular ecommerce shipping (I recommend it to everyone).\n\nThat being said, my issue is for when I have a subscriber on their second month. There is no new order created, I have to go back and find when the original order was placed. My process goes like this:\n\n&gt;I select all the of the customers who are due a package that month, choose \"Create Label for Selected Orders\", but then if I try to compile all the labels generated into one PDF, all of the past months labels are printed along with the new ones. That forces me to instead open each label in a separate tab and then go to each tab and press print. Not a terrible problem on a small scale, but doing it 100+ times takes a long time and opens the process up to human error.\n\nBasically, my issue is I can't have them all in the same PDF because they previous months labels would also end up in the PDF. I've spoken to support about and it seems like it'll happen eventually, but it's not a priority. That's fine, I totally understand how it is being a small company. I love the new features like pre-set package sizes. \n\nOne other thought that isn't entirely related - I ended up using Cratejoy as well as Shopify, you all should look into partnering with them if ever possible. They only have support for ShipStation, which is more expensive, so I manually export CSVs for batch label generation instead.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reaching out, it totally is a good ideal to troll reddit a bit to see what people are saying.

This has helped others in the past, so here are my suggestions:\n\n\nMy \"main\" second job is overnight pet-sitting from 7PM-7AM. I make about $60/night and it's usually for a week at a time, sometimes longer or shorter. For example, I just finished up a run of three clients from December 17th straight to January 1st. I don't have anyone else scheduled again until the end of this month (for now). I head to the client's house after work, walk/feed the dog(s), play with them, and then just chill on the couch, watch some TV, Reddit, and then go to sleep. In the morning I feed/walk and then head straight to work (if it's not a weekend). Easy money, no customer interactions, play with puppies. It's great!\n\n\n\nMy third job is my Etsy (now Shopify) store. After I get out of my full-time job, I go home to make video game related ornaments/pillows/etc until I finish. I recently turned it into a holiday-only shop, so I stopped taking orders last week to give myself a little break. I can sell whenever I want though and it's great extra money for something I like doing.\n\n \nMy fourth job is freelance graphic/web design. I have a BS in graphic design and have a few steady clients who ask for work from me every month. Most jobs make me a couple hundred for a few hours of work, which is great. Sometimes I do the work during my regular work day (lunch break) or on weekends. I will also work on a lot of these projects while I am pet sitting. I don't recommend doing design unless you are a professional, but if you have some other skill like coding or programming or something, you can do similar freelance work!\n\n \nI have successfully paid off one $3,500 student loan, my $9,000 car loan, my $13k student loan, and have just $9k remaining on what was a $23k student loan - all in 16 months. I paid off the majority of this (12 of 16 months) on my previous job making $41k/yr while living on my own, so these extra jobs obviously contributed to it a lot.

So think about this, if I came to your site and could only see the very first image of your slideshow and nothing else, would I know what you sell?\n\nI think you need to reorder your sidebar so that it flows: Mens, Womens, and then Hats.

Is that your logo or is that just so you can put something there?\n\nABOUT So I think you are missing a huge opportunity to make this brand at least somewhat about giving back. I know that there are so many amazing Vet charities that you could be contributing a % of sales to especially around PTSD and suicide prevention. I come from a military family so I know firsthand how important these organizations are and how easily it would be for you to put a real cause behind your brand. I\u2019m not saying to use a charity as a way to push sale but the reality is that you can do something really good here.  With the about statement I read that and thought \u201cawesome they are paying tribute to Vet and enlisted\u201d  but to whom and how? Though I searched the site I don\u2019t find anything.  This is something I think that you need to heavily consider doing.\n\nYou mentioned getting great reception at shows and that is awesome! That is one of the best ways to validate your idea. The problem with that is that shows are also the best way to get sales. I think most clothing purchases are based around touch, see, feel. You can only do one of those online. This actually brings me back to the importance of solid product photography . \n\nSo how do you get online sales? That\u2019s the question right? I am not a guru by any means I just know that some things that have worked for me is doing constant giveaways on social media, engaging with influencers in my niche, getting people to guest blog on my site, blogging for other people, growing my seo, and on and on and on. You have to do those things. I suggest you get more involved in your social, especially your Instagram, that is where the majority of attention is and honestly facebook is pretty much useless unless you are willing to drop dough. One thing about Instagram is that you have to post frequently and utilize all 30 of the hashtags that you get on top of post 3-5 times a day commenting on people\u2019s images that surround your niche and finding those accounts with a bunch of followers who you can send a tee to and will post about it. People here will say to use a service like Instagress but you need to put in some more baseline work before that should be in your wheelhouse. \nLeverage the fact that you are active duty I am not really sure how you can do this but there is a way and you need to figure it out. Maybe you need to post youtube videos of \u201cthings you need to do to prepare yourself for basic\u201d or make up some \u201cmilitary\u201d workout routine the list is endless of what you can use your expertise to push out to your audience. I am working on a series of videos for mine now, it really doesn\u2019t take much and sure they may suck at first but at least you are creating content.\n\nDo you know what your keywords are?  If you are like me and not wanting to spend a tone in marketing dollars then you need great SEO. Figure this out and start blogging.\n\nBack to your site  it looks like you might be using Squarespace? Get off of there and move to something like shopify. Trust me it\u2019s worth the time to rebuild the site. \n\nYou\u2019re missing some very crucial pieces on your site that could actually potentially get you in trouble as and ecommerce vendor. You need these pages on your site ASAP Shipping and Tracking, Terms and Conditions, Privacy, Returns, and the payment types that you accept in your footer.\n\nOverall I like where your head is but there is a lot of work to be done on your end. Set little milestones for the brand and make it about the small victories. I didn\u2019t make a single penny in profit in 2015 but I knew coming into building my brand that I wouldn\u2019t. Bootstrap the shit out of this, giveaway as much as you can afford, and start building a following. It takes time and again, not that I really know what I\u2019m doing but If this helps you a little, it was worth my fingers hurting. \n\nAlso, before I forget, go buy these books right now:---LINK---\n\n---LINK---", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1452117192, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3zo46f", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1454324258, "author": "clickgearclothing", "edited": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_cyohwg8"}

The feedback was priceless. \n\nDoing the research on your potential customer will help reduce a lot of risk. Don't worry if you feel stupid/amateurish when doing it.

{"body": "Yes, freelance.  I have worked 10+ years developing ProductCart-based online stores.  ProductCart is a small self-hosted platform that does what it is intended to do, but I feel like they are becoming more and more irrelevant.  I have worked with Shopify, BigCommerce, etc sites, but I am really drawn to self-hosted platforms.\n\nAround 6 months ago, I advised a client/friend of mine that ProductCart is not going to be sustainable for him in the long term.  I had built a ProductCart store for him several years back but each year we were having to pay a fee to upgrade to the latest version, and it doesn't even have responsiveness - just a very basic mobile 'app' which this day in age is not ideal.\n\nSo at the time I decided to get away from ProductCart and wanted to use it as a real excuse to finally get involved with Magento.  From what I could tell, Magento is what all the big dogs were using and I saw this as an opportunity to learn the software, build a new store for my client, and generally go through the learning process of working with Magento.  So I got 1.9x installed on a test server and was just surprised how much adversity I was facing getting even the basics setup.  I was just having difficulties with what seemed like a platform that was overly, unnecessarily complex.  But I have always prided myself in being a self-learner, and continued to develop the site with small but sure progress.\n\nThen in the middle of this new project, Magento 2.0x came out, and I thought this was the answer since the new Admin CP looked so much cleaner and more efficient the before.  I thought this is finally the modernized version of Magento.  But then I quickly realized just installing Magento 2 was far from ideal.  I spent 8 days working with experienced admins just getting Magento 2 installed and running properly with right caching software, js queries, etc.  And then the server resources just from an out-of-the-box install was more than the half-developed M1 site.  And then we went through the ringer just trying to setup some Sample Data (which Magento still says this is a known issue), and then I started reading how many others were having all kinds of issues with Magento 2, so I decided just to put M2 on the back burner until some updates were released - and I went back to developing the M1 store.  Right now I have the M1 store design down, I am in the process of importing products from the other client store and I am just having all kinds of issues with the finicky CSV import system.  So I have slowly been losing my 'Magento motivation' over the last few months.  I know this M1 build is overkill for my clients needs, but I looked at it as a learning process with incentive to finish (it's a real client store).  \n\nI am still going to work on these product CSV issues with the M1 build.  For example I import the entire product CSV and no errors, everything looks successful, but then there are no products in the admin backend.  And now I am reading stuff now about how Magento is dying and Woocommerce and other self-hosted platforms are on the rise and now I am thinking about just stopping the Magento project altogether and get a Wordpress/Woocommerce site up for my client - which I know I can do very quickly considering my background with Wordpress.  That way my customer can get his shiny new site with full responsiveness, and I can get this project done and off the checklist, but that also means that I have 'given up' on Magento, which I am not ready to do yet.

{"body": "Hello. Thanks for having this giveaway. It's a great way to keep users engaged, and a great way to have a pretty much free and wide UX playtest. I've been in the field of design for 15 years now, holding various positions from Web to UX to Studio Head, and here is my take on the site.\n\nHere are my specs:\n\n* Windows 8.1\n* Chrome\n* 1920 x 1080\n* 32\"\n\nI went into the site expecting to find what I wanted to find. I knew that I was going into an eJuice website, so I was not confused at all. Random users stumbling into the website might have some questions, as they are only greeted by the large header.\n\nAs I scroll down the page, the low contrast color scheme is pleasant. As I reach the flavors on the home page, the link between juice naming scheme and the brand name becomes apparent, and instantly brings a smile to my face.\n\nThe sample pack seems to me like something you wanted to push more, as it was the only one with the option to Add to Cart. Having the descriptor \"Get a taste of all 6 Safari Juices!\" at the bottom of the sale item seemed weird to me, as it feels like a descriptor (which should be on top, beside the header), but also wants to act as a Call To Action (but is unable to, because it's just normal text). It bugs me.\n\nThe \"i\" Information symbol next to 75% VG looked like I was able to interact with it. Like, look, here's some information, come check it out. Mousing over and clicking produced nothing, and it bugs me.\n\nHow It's Made video looks like something great to have, especially when you are taking so much care into the production line. However, the current thumbnail slightly bugs me. The freeze frame shows the first person in line with black gloves. The rest are not wearing gloves. You can't do much about that, and most other people wouldn't notice it, but please consider using a customised Thumbnail splash.\n\nThe footer area seems completely fine. I took a look at the rest of your social media accounts, and noticed none has been updated to the latest branding yet.\n\nI next went into your About Page to learn more about the brand. One thing on my mind was to find out which country Safari Juices originated from. That information was unfortunately not there. I know that there is one main person behind it named \"Andrew\". Who's Andrew? The CEO? The Owner? I didn't really care much for the About page because it was simply boring, with the same type of information normally found on dime a dozen about pages.\n\nContact Page: Well, there it is. Toronto, Canada. Everything looks fine here. I understand not including your other inlets for contact on the Social Media pages, as it is right below in the footer.\n\nI then proceeded to make a purchase.\n\nI jumped into the Shop page, which looked exactly the same as the home page. This disoriented me initially, and I clicked the Shop button again to be sure. I'm a big fan of Coffee &amp; Caramel, so I clicked immediately on Oryx, and was brought to the product page. I looked around for an actual image of the product, and realised there was none. Please consider putting the actual product into the site, so that I may know what it looks like, and that I know I'm receiving the correct item. I clicked add to cart, returned to my reddit post, typed a few sentences and went back to your site, to notice nothing has changed. After exiting the page into another flavor and adding another bottle, I noticed the very minor \"Added to cart\" prompt which I didn't before. I think a bit more prominence should be placed here, to let the user know that something good happened.\n\nI hit Check Out, and was immediately transferred to another different website. The default Shopify checkout cart. :( Please flesh it out.\n\nI hope this information has helped you in some way.", "id": "cypmytz", "subreddit": "electronic_cigarette", "edited": 1452194222, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmlu", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1452193610, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3zw8hn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1454342950, "author": "roomnoxii", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_3zw8hn"}

{"id": "cypt77t", "body": "Honestly, I'm going to be pretty harsh here - my goal is to be constructive, but the indie polish market is ridiculously saturated, and you've got to stand out and be extremely well put-together in order to succeed. \n\n* You need swatch photos and better quality bottle shots. The bottle shots are at odd angles, and the colors of the bottle shots are all over the place. The busy brick background takes attention away from the polish. If I'm going to buy a polish, especially from a new brand, I need to see swatch photos from a reliable blogger/swatcher.\n* You may want to rethink your labels. You're trying to position yourself as a luxury brand, but it looks like you've printed out labels yourself, cut them, and stuck them on the bottles. Some labels appear crooked, and I can see the label outline on the picture of Smolder.\n* Your prices are high, especially for the minis. The highest I see in the indie market is usually $5 for 5 ml, and I'm personally unwilling to pay that. The highest I'm willing to go for full size is usually $12-$13, and that's only with very established brands that have polishes that somehow stand out. \n* I'd like to see more about you on your website! Is there only one person behind the brand, or multiple? How did you get started? What makes your brand special? You need something beyond, \"hooray, we're 5 free!\" A ton of indie brands are 5 free nowadays, so that doesn't stick out to me as a consumer. \n* How will you make your polishes unique? It looks like you picked up some TKB base and mixed some pigment/mica in there. While this is how most makers start out, it isn't something that is going to sell in this saturated market. You need a niche - perfect creme formulas? Gorgeous holos and flakes? Deep jelly glitters? Don't go looking to consumers to tell you what we want - we're constantly being wowed by what indie polish lines come up with; we often don't know what we want until we see it!\n* I'd like to see some information on your testing process, especially after the Mentality fiasco. How long do you test? What's your testing process? (share within reason; I know indie makers are protective of their process, understandably so!)  \n* Your shipping costs are extremely high. It looks like you have a flat rate of $6, but I'd really recommend a tiered shipping cost. If I were a buyer considering purchasing a single polish to try out your brand, that cost would be an immediate turn-off; the most I would expect to pay to ship a single polish within the US is $3. Also, while I understand your  policy regarding damage in transit, it makes me extremely wary as a buyer - it gives me the impression that if something breaks during shipping, your shop is going to say I'm SOL and need to go fight USPS on my own. \n* I do like your website - it's clean, easy to navigate, and shopify has always given me a good buying experience.\n\nI hope this feedback helps.

If you aren't already, make sure you're on Etsy (you probably are) \n- You can create awesome guides and email campaigns that help both advanced and beginner knitters, promoting your designs and social groups a long the way.

{"body": "Might sound harsh, but it's all in love from one entrepreneur to another:\n\nYou've been open 44 days with 137 users. That's the primary reason why you've only made one sale. A *very* rough estimation of the overall average Conversion Rate online is 1-2%, so overall you're roughly average. (This is *extremely* rough. You don't have enough traffic to really 'know' anything yet.)\n\nWork on your site. Other users have pointed out numerous things that could be improved, and, as a Web Developer, I found quite a few things myself that could be done:\n\n# TODO LIST\n\n**PLATFORM**\n\nAfter working with eCommerce companies (and having started one myself), I can tell you you're better in the long-term to use Shopify rather than WordPress. It's purpose-built for eCommerce, and will solve 80% of the problems you'll have in the future. \n\nIf you can afford it, hire a developer and build with [Craft Commerce]---LINK--- It's built by some of the best developers online, and has every feature you'd want in any other platform. **I can't overstate how good this platform is.** But, you will need a developer, so I understand that it's not possible for smaller businesses.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**HOSTING**\n\nI saw that you were on GoDaddy; once you see real traffic, you're going to have a bad time with WordPress on GoDaddy hosting. if you use Shopify, you don't have to worry about hosting. For anything else I'd use [DreamHost]---LINK---, or hire a developer and use [DigitalOcean]---LINK--- (DO is the cheapest and most reliable hosting you'll find. $5/month for your own server that *isn't* crap.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TRAFFIC** \n\nAs I said earlier, the overall Conversion Rate online is ~1-2%. For every 100 people that visit your site, **one** will likely buy something. This is the primary reason why businesses panic online. They see that over 100 people have visited, and\u2014wouldn't you know it\u2014*only one person bought something.*\n\n**This is normal for a new website.**\n\nYou **start** here, and optimize your site as you go. Find a good theme on Shopify, add your content, take some good product photos, and you'll be into the 2-3% bracket. Go from there. (If you don't use Shopify, you can still apply this to almost any other system.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# HUGE IMPORTANT POINT:\n\nNot all traffic is created equal. As an eCommerce site, you should prefer 100 targeted visits instead of 1,000 visits from random people.\n\nThis is because of a few reasons:\n\n1. Save on hosting, if we're talking huge traffic numbers\n2. Better conversion rates, because the visitor has an interest in the product, and is a potential customer\n3. It's easier to sell to targeted visitors. You can assume they know at least a *little* bit about your product, or at the very-least have a passing interest.\n\n# Email Marketing\n\nI could write a book about this. *Email Marketing the critical keystone to building successful businesses.* Here's the basics of what you should be doing:\n\n1. Write freaking amazing articles. You should feel like you're supposed to be charging for this much value.\n2. Offer another huge value PDF with more information on the topic in exchange for an email address.\n3. In that Email list, send more hugely valuable content every time you click 'Send'. Only pitch your stuff every 1/6 emails.\n4. Segment your list. If someone's looking at couches on your site, send them more information about couches, and mention a few of your best-selling couches. (Your developer should be able to tell you how to set this up. If they don't, you'll be looking for someone that does Analytics. Find someone that does eCommerce.)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions; I'd be glad to answer them.", "id": "cys205h", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1452368417, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3zo1p5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1454384754, "author": "NeedsMoreMagic", "edited": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t1_cynr9r4"}

{"id": "cyssvot", "body": "I think it comes down to two things:\n\n* Revenue\n* How much ecommerce is a part of your company (or how much your company depends on ecommerce)\n\nGood Magento development is *hard*. Magento has all those flaws you described - it's simply part of open source web development (as opposed to a SAAS solution like BigCommerce/Shopify). However, high-end Magento specialised agencies can deal with those issues in a *much* better way, giving you the luxury of not having to think about it. However, they are *expensive* and it comes down to how much money you make.\n\nMagento is more customisable than Shopify, so if you need complex integrations with third party systems, functionality other than traditional ecommerce, custom product structures and so on, then Magento is the way to go. The reason I listed \"How much ecommerce is part of your business\" is because you can usually change the way your business is run to fit Shopify's SAAS model. However, for some companies it's not worth it and in their case it would make more sense to have something custom and as close to the way their ecommerce business is run/managed, which is where Magento comes in.\n\nWe had a fairly big client $2+ million revenue/year with very complex product structures, odd GeoIP and pricing requirements, complex shipping rules, etc. that got fed up using Magento (they switched development/design agencies like 4 times), moved to Shopify and in the process ditching half their \"requirements\" that Shopify couldn't deal with. In the end, it worked out for them - they had the luxury of being able to ditch their original requirements.\n\nHowever, there are lots of companies that can't do that and it's up to you to figure out in which segment you're in.

Magento: Advanced knowledge required (PHTML/XML - must) difficult to work without knowledge of Magento Developer Guidelines, advanced file and code structure. Open source, PHP, Zend Framework, standalone.\n\n2. ZenCart: Averenge PHP knowledge required. Oldish, not user-friendly. Open-source, PHP, no framework, standalone.\n\n3. VirtueMart: Nothing special, many required functionalities are missing, use only if client already running Joomla. Open-source, PHP, no framework, used with Joomla, mambo.\n\n4. osCommerce: Many developers left to ZenCart and Magento and hacked in 2011. Losing positions and any potential. Open-source, PHP, no framework, standalone.\n\n5. PrestaShop: Almost all Magento Community and some Magento Enterprise features for free - Magento competitor. Export to eBay, RMA, Loyalty Program, refferal rewards. Open-source, PHP, Smarty, standalone.\n\n6. Volusion: Use custom Volusion API and provide dev wiki, code examples looks really complicated. Impressive functionality provided. Top rated e-com platform. Not open-source, PHP, no framework, used with Drupal.\n\n7. Ubercart: Includes standard package of e-com features, nothing special. Open-source, PHP, no framework, used with Dropal.\n\n8. BIGCommerce: Uses REST API. Impressive functionality provided, however only templating is possible, no access to login functions or php files. Not open-source, no framework, standalone\n\n9. OpenCart: Only base e-com features available, fast growing platform that have a potential. Open-source, PHP, no framework, standalone.\n\n10. WPCommerce: Very simple PCI, very easy to customize. Use only if running Wordpress or need fast solution for simple store with several categories and 20-50 products. Wordpress is most popular blogging platform and unbelievably user-friendly, probably best solution for very small stores. Open-source, PHP, no framework, used with Wordpress.\n\n11. CS Cart: Top class e-com solution using multi-vendor edition, probably top Magento competitor. Open-source (free only community edition), PHP, Zend Framework, standalone. Excellent UI (Better than Magento/Shopify)\n\n12. Shopify: Very impressive platform, modern and stylish, rapidly growing, have a potential. Not open-source, PHP, no framework, standalone.\n\n13. Mive Merchant: Uses custom API, interesting platform to look at. Standard package of e-com features. Not open-source, MIVA Script, no framework, standalone.\n\n14. IBM Commerce: Not open-source, Java EE, standalone. Standard package of e-com features.

{"body": "I may be very interested in the order &amp; fulfillment management once it is released.  Here is my current situation + feedback:\n\nCurrently, all orders that come in are sent directly to InSite's NutriLoader system and they route the email and order details directly to Europa for fulfillment.  This is a great feature, but the problem is that I have 0 flexibility over what the invoice looks like and I never know if the email actually gets to Europa because their solution doesn't have the ability to cc me on emails (not a clue why, this is an easy feature to implement).  Sure, I see the email from Shopify about the order, but not the email that InSite automatically sends to Europa so I never know if they received it.  If an email gets dropped by the NutriLoader, then that order won't be processed.  The only way I know it was sent successfully is when Europa responds back to me manually saying the order has been processed, but that can take up to a day.  Something to consider as you build out/modify your solution to work with Europa...\n\nAlso, if the deal /u/jmd9973 mentioned is accurate, then you are offering a better deal than InSite.  They are currently charging $79/month with 1 year free of Europa's data feed, then it is $1000/year for the datafeed after that (paid to Europa).  $50/month + free 6 months of datafeed &amp; $500 after that for 12 months sounds quite appealing from ChannelApe.\n\nRegarding variants - It looks like your variant handling is decent with flavor &amp; size separation.  One thing that concerns me is this: ---LINK---\n\nThere are two options in terms of variants which I like.  However, it seems like the 'size' dropdown menu is just a dump of ALL size variants for ALL flavors.  This won't work because not all flavors offer a 10lb or 1lb version so the user will see \"Unavailable\" a lot.  There are also multiple versions of \"5 lbs\" which can be super confusing to customers as well.  I can see that being a headache for the site admin to clean up since I imagine your product loader is automatic and will overwrite any changes the store owner makes to the products.\n\nFull disclosure - Here is my site with the same product: ---LINK---\n\nWhile my variant handling isn't really any better since everything is mixed up, there are at least restrictions to what size &amp; flavor there are so the user isn't *as* confused (although I know it can be frustrating now to find the correct flavor and size since they're all out of order. i've been stomping my feet about this for months to InSite).  Also, one of the downsides to InSite is the image &amp; variant handling together.  If I rearrange the variant options in alphabetic &amp; size order, I also have to re-arrange the variant images manually in the Store Admin Product page to match the variant order I set or else when i click on \"Bananas &amp; Cream 2lbs,\" I may see the image for \"Extreme Milk Chocolate 5lbs\" since the variant order matches the order in which the variant images were uploaded to Shopify.  The problem though is that InSite's inventory loader overwrites any changes the store owner makes (as I alluded to above) so any change i make is eventually overwritten.  If you guys can handle changes made by the store owner and not overwriting them with your automatic loader, then you're a step ahead of the game and have potentially won my business.\n\nIf you have a mailing list specifically for Europa updates, please PM me the mailing list I can subscribe to for updates.", "id": "cyy5x8z", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1452795361, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3gzu63", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1454490276, "author": "x3knet", "edited": 1452795730, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_cyy4718"}

{"id": "cyy81y8", "body": "Alright so I checked out your site (linked to in another comment) and I have some advice. \n\nFirst off, as somebody who actually sells SEO services and has also built my own eCommerce stores utilizing SEO to drive all traffic, I have to be honest and say *skip it* right now. Your brand is not where it needs to be (yet) and there are better ways to spend your time right now. \n \n**A couple of reasons:** \n\n* In your niche, brand awareness is key. You shouldn't aim to show up in search for \"women's clothing\" and your likely buyers aren't searching that way anyway. \n\n*  SEO will take longer than you can probably stomach right now.\n\n\n**Suggestion 1** **- Your Branding**\n\n* An ecommerce website is a lot like a brick and mortar storefront. The experience is important to a customer's perception of your brand. Colors, fonts, and definitely \"sections\" are key to defining the brand feel and how the customer feels buying from you. Right now, yours is quite bare. \n* Your logo needs work. You can simply design one with a custom font (free ones from dafont.com) for example and save it as a .png file or you can pay a site like Fiverr even to make one for you on the cheap. I always do this myself but hey, thats up to you and your skills. \n* Your site needs work. Your site is pretty naked and even a free Shopify template should get you further along. That said, I don't know which shopping engine you're using. In any case, invest in spending time on the homepage design and follow that with your category pages. Need inspiration? Look at Shopify's gallery of fashion sites: ---LINK---\n* It's okay to be \"minimal\" in your branding and design but remember that how you look can impact a person's decision to buy from you. Buying is more than just what is for sell, it's the experience, it's a sense of wanting to be part of a brand. I just think you guys need improvement and focus here. \n* Finally, start with noting what you like in other sites and mimic it. \n\n**Suggestion 2 - Instagram and Social**\n\n* Women find brands with Instagram. It's extremely popular and a good way to utilize influencers (who already have a big following) to promote your brand. \n\n* Once your site is polished and you love your look (with good feedback too!) consider finding a budget to pay a popular instagrammer with reach in your market to sponsor you. Give them a shirt and a scarf and have them do a model shot in it and shout you out. You can maybe find services to find these women for you but I suggest just identifying them yourself and reaching out. It's possible many may do it just for a free shirt. Imagine reaching a following of 500k followers...\n\n* If you're going to put budget into ads, I'd definitely do it in social and mainly instagram vs. any search ads. Remember, most of your customers aren't searching Google for \"women's purses\" to find somebody like you. You need to build awareness of you. \n\n**Suggestion 3 - Know Your Nut**\n\nHere's something way too many businesses fail at - knowing what makes them unique. What is your thing that people would talk about? You can always grow towards Need Supply or Anthropologie (which you're obviously way away from today but ... baby steps) -- what is your big thing right now that people can identify with? I personally like your direction with the hand made stuff. I think it's unique, artistically consistent (important) and COULD be used to develop what exactly the forLincoln brand is. \n\n* Put unique looks together and \"look book\" part or all of your homepage. Check out most boutique clothing websites and they're probably doing similar - unless they're focused on one specific thing like socks, or hats, or fur panties. \n\n* Highlight your story. I immediately wonder what forLincoln means. Is that a kid?\n\n* Highlight your unique offering - what only you sell. That's your hand stuff. And yes, promote the hell out of it on Etsy like the other commenter said. This is a market of people already on a site looking to buy things like what you make. \n\n* If you want to be a standalone bigger thing like NeedSupply, you need a lot more product and to not promote your own line so much. But that's expensive of course and probably not what you're suited to do today. \n\n**In Summary** \n\nTake time first to clean up your site, get a nicer more professional look together, and build out an awesome site experience. This will use images heavily most likely. Next, get it in front of influencers and consider giving out free product to potential promoters. Continue forever to work on highlighting what makes you special and minimize the noise. This is how you get people talking about you and develop a brand image. Skip on SEO right now and point your ad dollars to influencers, not search ads.

{"body": "/u/brighton36 and /u/junseth have a vendetta against OpenBazaar for some reason, probably because they view it as a competitor project to their own. \n\nI probably shouldn't feel obligated to spend time responding to their (prolific!) attacks on the project but I've worked hard on OB for a long time and it's hard to see people engaged in a campaign to smear it.\n\nI respond to their claims but they just later claim that we ignore them. I'll aggregate some of my responses here.\n\nI'll try to just make this post the final word and not get drawn into these pointless squabbles anymore, though I've said that in the past probably...\n\n#\"OpenBazaar Pivoted\"\n\nChris likes to claim that we \"pivoted\" away from DarkMarket, which was solely focused on illicit goods. However, we've said from the beginning that our focus was much broader and we felt that peer to peer trade would be valuable for all goods. DarkMarket had too narrow a vision.\n\nIf you don't believe this, check out the [article]---LINK--- Wired wrote in August of 2014, literally titled \"Creators of New Fed-Proof Bitcoin Marketplace Swear It\u2019s Not for Drugs.\" Here's a quote:\n\n&gt; But Patterson and OpenBazaar founder Brian Hoffman adamantly insist OpenBazaar isn\u2019t designed for selling narcotics, guns, or other contraband. They see their invention as a freer,  more democratic eBay or Craigslist, with no seller fees and no one to arbitrarily change the rules or censor products. \u201cWe\u2019re not the \u2018Super Silk Road.\u2019 We\u2019re trying to replace eBay in a better form,\u201d says Patterson. \u201cWe recognize that people may choose to use that technology in a way we see as distasteful, immoral, and illegal, but we\u2019re giving them the option to engage in a kind of human interaction that doesn\u2019t exist right now.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Patterson says OpenBazaar is \u201clisting agnostic,\u201d and argues the vast majority of buyers and sellers will use it for the same type of things sold on eBay and the now-defunct Bitcoin marketplace Bitmit.\n\nIf you have a computer and an internet connection, you can engage in trade with anyone else in the world at no cost and with no reliance on any middlemen. Just download and launch an application and you can participate in global trade. I view that as useful to more than just people selling contraband.\n\n#\"OpenBazaar is Not Decentralized\"\n\nJoshua has [repeatedly]---LINK--- [claimed]---LINK--- [that]---LINK--- OpenBazaar is not decentralized, despite me pointing out his error constantly.\n\nOpenBazaar is a decentralized, peer to peer network. There is no central authority that controls the network. Amazon and eBay and pretty much all online markets have a central authority; OpenBazaar doesn't. I'll quote myself from an [earlier post]---LINK--- to clearly define what decentralized means.\n\n&gt; &gt;In such a decentralized system, there is no single centralized authority that makes decisions on behalf of all the parties.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is no single centralized authority that makes decisions on OpenBazaar.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Instead each party, also called a peer, makes local autonomous decisions towards its individual goals which may possibly conflict with those of other peers. Peers directly interact with each other and share information or provide service to other peers.\n&gt; \n&gt; OpenBazaar is composed of peers which makes their own decisions, who directly interact with others and share information or provide services to other peers.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;An open decentralized system is one in which the entry of peers is not regulated. Any peer can enter or leave the system at any time. \n&gt; \n&gt; Entry of peers is not regulation on OpenBazaar and any peer can enter or leave the system at any time.\n&gt; \n&gt; I could go one but it's pretty clear that according to any reasonable definition the OpenBazaar network is decentralized. Your persistence in repeating this \"OB isn't decentralized\" claim shows you are intentionally misleading people. \n\n#\"OpenBazaar is just a worse version of HTTP\"\n\nAs I said in [this post]---LINK---\n\n&gt; Our system uses the Ricardian contract model to create contracts that are electronically signed by all parties involved. Everything you need to continue the trade, or settle a dispute, is included in the contract, and because it's signed it's an immutable record of trade.\n&gt; \n&gt; HTTP doesn't do this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, there will be services to interact with the network via HTTP, just like there are services to interact with the blockchain via HTTP.\n\nAnd [here]---LINK---\n\n&gt; You realize that you also can't access the blockchain directly from your browser either?\n&gt; So a blockchain based market like Drop Zone and a p2p market like OpenBazaar both need a third party service to view the markets directly via HTTP.\n&gt; \n&gt; Only difference is that with a p2p market you can access them directly by running the client, whereas you would need to download the entire blockchain to view them directly with a blockchain based market?\n&gt; \n&gt; It's a ridiculous criticism.\n\n#\"OpenBazaar is trivially censorable\"\n\nThey think the best approach for building a marketplace is to put all the data into the blockchain because it makes it highly censorship-resistant, and they place a strong emphasis on that. \n\nBut there are all kinds of drawbacks to doing that, and we choose a different architecture. We take an approach much more similar to the Bittorrent network. It doesn't use a blockchain for hosting data, but instead it hosts the data on individual nodes. Each user on the network hosts its own content. This means that if the store goes down, other users cannot reach it (like a node on any other peer to peer network). We have talked about making store data redundant, and might try to use something like IPFS so that other stores can cache data in the future.\n\nCensorship cannot be done at the network level. There's no \"marketplace administrator\" that can take down stores like on centralized marketplaces, whether clearnet like eBay or Darknet like Silk Road. There's also no ability to censor a store based on the DNS system. Censorship would need to be someone else going to each person's home and unplugging their computers.\n\nSince most people are engaging in commerce that puts them at no threat of having someone bust down their door and shut down their computer, this isn't such a huge problem. Besides; what's the point of having that information duplicate somewhere else if you're unable to operate your store since you're in jail? \n\nUsers who do care about privacy can already run OpenBazaar behind a VPN they trust. This would prevent others from seeing your IP and then the ability to censor becomes way more difficult.\n\nIf the only person who can really censor you is a nation-state level actor - and they can only censor you by physically shutting down your computer - then I consider that censorship-resistant.\n\n#\"OpenBazaar is just a Shitty Shopify / Magneto / web-hosted store\"\n\nI hear this one a lot but it's [silly]---LINK---\n\n&gt; Shopify requires a monthly fee ranging from $9-$179.\n&gt; \n&gt; OpenBazaar is free to use.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shopify charges 2.4% of each sale plus $0.30 for each credit card transaction.\n&gt; \n&gt; OpenBazaar has no transaction fees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shopify requires integration into an existing webpage, meaning a user must be paying for a domain and web hosting and must be able to configure their site to use Shopify.\n&gt; \n&gt; OpenBazaar requires no web hosting and no manual configuration of anything, just download and install.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shopify is not a network of users.\n&gt; \n&gt; OpenBazaar is a community of people who can engage in trade directly with each other anywhere in the world using only their computers, the OpenBazaar software, and Bitcoin.\n&gt; OpenBazaar isn't a panacea, nor will the first version be perfect. Skepticism is warranted, but simply labeling it a shitty version of an existing product isn't accurate or fair. Wait until it's released and had time for adoption - at the very least - before passing judgement.\n\nThere's two huge differences that they ignore. \n\n1) It's not at all simple to go through the process of buying a domain and hosting, then setting up the site and integrating Magneto or whatever. OpenBazaar is free, and it's just download and run the file, that's it. Super easy.\n\n2) OpenBazaar instantly connects you to everyone else using it - buyers and sellers. Also, with a self-hosted site you usually accept the coins directly or rely on a payment processor; OpenBazaar gives you an open marketplace for trusted third parties to join in 2-of-3 multisig for trusted escrow.\n\n#Other\n\nI don't have the energy to keep going but I might keep updating this comment as the official \"responding to Chris and Joshua's bullshit\" comment.\n\nIf you're serious about finding out more about OpenBazaar, check out our subreddit /r/OpenBazaar or [join our Slack]---LINK---", "id": "cyyfud5", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1452808739, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_40yzt7", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 11, "retrieved_on": 1454495091, "author": "CC_EF_JTF", "edited": false, "ups": 11, "parent_id": "t3_40yzt7"}

This is what I provided them:\n\n-------------------------------\nThank you so much for getting in touch with me.  We're looking to see if a few data fields that already exist can be transmitted in their own fields to the payment gateways.   The value of this feature to a company like us is 250-300 dollars a day.\n\nBasically, in bigcommerce they added a PO field and populated it with the order number, a sales tax field and a freight field which is simply the cost of shipping if it exists.  There is also a duty field but that   That satisfies the requirement and each transaction will be eligible for a .25% cheaper merchant service rate.  \n\nDocumentation guide Page 43,44,45\n---LINK---\nDefault values:\nPO:  Order number  (In our case the number we show on the receipt already)\nSales tax: 0.00 if not applicable\nFreight : 0.00 If no shipping\n\nNot required but available:\nDuty : if shipping out of country - duty1  &lt;!&gt; export &lt;!&gt; 31 (total of order)\n^this is constructed from existing data\nso a duty will always be the following 2 values plus the total of the sale without a currency\nduty1\nexport\n31.00\n \n\n---LINK---\n\nI would suspect that this simple addition of data to your gateway as well would enable the shopify payment gateway to absorb a additional .25% per transaction as well which in turn would be an additional 250 dollars on each 100,000 in revenue.  Score that against the total number of revenue daily and you have a pretty big number that should justify the cost of development.\n\nIt also effects transactions over 10,000 dollars.

I believe this may have changed on the recent update about a month ago. I would confirm that first.\n\nIn terms of a product \"template\", I'm still not sure what this looks like in your mind. When you use Squarespace, you're already working with a site-wide website template that has different layouts (templates) for different types of content (blog, gallery, products, etc). When you build a Squarespace website the layouts and templates are customized to your liking. Within each product there is a blank canvas page builder where you drop in your content to create your product pages. This doesn't require HTML because Squarespace's page builder renders the HTML for you.\n\nWhat it sounds like you'll need to do is first design the Squarespace template to match the design you're after, then start creating the products.\n\n###Importing\nThere is no import feature for Squarespace. I have no idea why and it's absurd that the current platform is over 4 years old with no way to import content.\n\nThe only way I know of to get around this horrible limitation is to import to a test Shopify website, then import into Squarespace using their Shopify to Squarespace importer.\n\n###Submit your feedback to Squarespace\nIf I haven't caused you to rethink your Squarespace usage yet, I would ask that you please send in your concerns to Squarespace and request these features.

They will help you set it up, then get credit card processing for vaping which there's many who do it now, and get it plugged in on shopify and your done. \n\nThe clean room thing is just what \"big vape\" aka spacejam cutwood, etc, said they had so people would justify paying $22-$30 for a 30ml bottle. Let me ask you, do any of you or your fellow DIY vape friends make their juice in their at home clean room? No they don't. Has anyone gotten \"unclean room\" sickness? No. So it's a bunch of bull shit and it actually hurt the vape industry because now the FDA has wind of this clean room crap these big companies are claiming and realize if they require everyone else to have one, eventually 90% of the vape industry will die. \n\nI would just get started bud, you can upgrade to an LLC or Corp and get insurance later.

Order quality product and make less margins but have less issues or roll the dice and sell a cheap crap product and hope the high margins can sustain the returns and chargebacks.

What about something a little bit more tangible. \n\nGot a couple hours and $5?\n\n---LINK---\n\nThat's an assignment of this class. And they constantly come up with great ideas of how they could generate revenue with just $5 and 2 hours. Hint: forget about the $5. \n\nOr here's a real easy one. Go buy something and mark it up to sell on eBay. It's doable. It's not easy. But just go through those steps and see if you can get someone to buy something for a small markup. One great place to find stuff to sell is free stuff people are giving away. Go check out Craigslist. There's all sorts of things people don't want. They just want someone to do the leg work and get it out of their house. TVs, ping pong tables, pianos. \n", "subreddit": "startups", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh26", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1453188388, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_41ktmy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1454586244, "author": "n8dog", "edited": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_41ktmy"}

On the other hand, some people not interested at first might change their mind and come to you.\n\n\nWhat I suggest :\n\nA) Build yourself an \"almost free\" website (0-200$) to present your services from a theme via Wordpress, Shopify,etc... then set a small Google adwords or facebook ad campaigns locally directed (I guess you won't be doing this further than 200miles from your home :) ).\nThen put some tracking (via google analytics, optimizely,etc...) and see who reaches the checkout and click on \"buy now\".\nThe payment part doesn't even have to work as long as you have the stats on how many people were ready to buy.\n\nB) If you are little more old school and have good contact with people. Well, there is no better way than knocking on doors and just presenting your product, asking people what they think about it.\nYou will learn invaluable insights about what people want/do not want, how to sell your product for people who are interested vs. not interested, etc... by the end of the day you will have a clearer view of your target audience and your selling points.\n\n\nIn a nutshell : Go test it in the field directly, it will only cost you time.

{"body": "There is a lot to managing adwords and with your average ticket size you have a good opportunity to drive some sales. There are a few things that I would recommend focusing on before trying to ramp up spending:\n\n1) Optimize your landing page and sale process. I wasn't clear if your conversion rate was from the click to the sale or on page conversion for your site visitor to the sale. (that matters.) Either way you want your conversion rate to stabilize. Use explainer videos, great graphics and easy to understand navigation. Make sure your site is fast. I love shopify and it seems that you are using that. I don't know enough about your audience to fairly give feedback about the look and feel in general.\n\n2) You need to find the keywords that convert and the ones that don't and be aggressive about using negative keywords.\n\n3) Remember in PPC there is an \"efficient frontier\". If you try to scale up in order to skip to the end you will over spend. I had a business that we spent 100K per month on google and got 1M in sales. (Cost per Sale of $75.00 - very profitable). Then we spent 200K and got to 2M in sales. We spent 300K and got 3M in sales. We spent 400K and got 4M in sales. Then I said, \"let's skip to the end!\" and we spend 750K in one month and got......4M in sales. Ultimately we determined that our efficient frontier was 450K to get about 5M in sales. Remember that there is a point where the cost per sale is worth it and beyond that is not a place you want to go.\n\n4) Come up with key indicators to manage by. For me if I can spend $1 in ad and get $2 in gross profit then I am all in. Find your key indicators and manage to those aggressively. There are plenty of PPC management agencies who can manage and scale the account probably better than you can internally so once your spend reaches a reasonable level to warrant outside management you should consider it.\n\n5) I didn't have time to study your spreadsheet, but you're on the right track to track your metrics and make a chart of your daily data points. I was always amazed at how the visual became instantly instructive when the individual data points were harder to assimilate.\n\nGood luck.

I'm not under the impression that Swamp Pop was created years ago with the secret agenda of being using in any marketing materials for movies. That just seems too far fetched for me to believe.\n\nThat being said (and accepted as fact), Swamp Pop obviously can't operate solely for the purposes of this ARG. That means a lot of the content on their website is NOT in-game content. So far the ONLY real links to 10CL from Swamp Pop are on the shopify page they have (linked to from Buy Online). That is where ALL of the references are.\n\nHere's the weird thing. Their communication has completely stopped at this point though. I personally have never heard back from them, and have only seen a few instances of responses from them, maybe around 5 at most. That seems awfully low for a company agreeing to take part in an ARG for this movie which is coming out in less than 2 months. You'd think they'd want to kick this off and get the mystery going, because for now we are pretty locked down on hearing back from them.\n\nWhat does it mean when the company goes silent? Is there something for us to find given their responses? Or do we need to wait to hear their response to the \"How's the weather in....\" question? Do we even know if that's part of the game or just part of signature? \n\nHow many people ACTUALLY saw the \"humid\" tweet from SwampPop? Is that confirmed real? Or a hoax? That would obviously by a big clue I think we should discuss more if it's proven to be real, but I find it strange they would delete the tweet without many people discovering it.

Some businesses have offered discounts etc.  Also even as a user myself I have quite a different experience when a business owner tells me what to expect and they deliver, vs the companies that send no update, just a late payment.  A positive or negative review would be a reflection of that communication and follow through.  That's the intention at least.\n\n2) Troubled offers - I think that is a problem, feel free to shoot me an e-mail about the specific offers you're worried about.  We are in communication with most of the owners at this point.  We're looking at instituting a policy where when the cancellation vote happens you have 30 days to say yes or no, otherwise your vote is counted as an abstention.  We've also talked about making the cancellation % viewable after you have voted to cancel.  Would that help?\n\n3) API - Contracted out to a firm, should be done mid-Feb.  It will allow for inventory tracking from businesses that use Shopify.  Other integrations will be coming in the future.\n\n4) Rocks - I'll be sharing these soon in a blog post.

I acknowledge the dates selected were not arbitrary. \n\nI was on their facebook page first and got to noticing that they had absolutely zero mention of the drink in the 10CL move/trailer. They also had no shop for awhile. I wanted to see when the shop was added only because initially I misread their copyright at 2016 to suggest they suddenly did it. But as I looked over the past iterations of the site I see their habit is to update the copyright to each current year, as opposed to retaining the original first copyright and - to current like most people.\n\nThat part is pretty much where shit derailed and these know it alls decided to prove it wrong so now they insist the shopify site was only done after the release and that something something January 17th. \n\nThat wasn't what I wrote nor where I was headed. I wanted to know when the site changed because I saw mentions on facebook about them offering a particular drink in 2013 I think for the shirts but there's no store online. I found that curious and went to see when the store was added - to confirm or refute whether or not it was added in 2016. My train of thought was settling the copyright curiosity. \n\nEvery single year the site had been active, each calendar month marked by one of the blue circles, for last crawled, still provided clear enough information that the website had or had not changed during that period of time. The site looked one way in August 2015 and then changed to its current iteration by November 2015. And the one for January 10 - offhand but the earliest one in Jan. showed the addition of one of the current menu links and removal of another one. They were messing with the site during these periods and whoever claims they went to Swamp Pop within an hour of the trailer release is full of shit because nobody even heard about this until later into Day 2. \n\nHere's what these know it alls don't seem smart enough to sort out. They insist SP changed and added this stuff because of all the traffic they suddenly got. But that isn't reality. Their drink brand isn't even noticeable in the trailer and it required somebody sorting through the frames til they could confirm Swamp Pop and then acknowledging it's a real company.\n\nThen ONE person is the first one to go check out that site and what that person discovered = before any traffic - was the image and shelter supply stuff and they promptly went and shared that all over the place and THEN the traffic began to flow to their site. This stuff was already there...otherwise nobody had any damn reason to go to their site either way. The only reason anybody from an ARG group even gave a shit about that site was the association made with Slusho to see if there was anything to it. The first person to do that saw all this stuff, the 4813, the slusho tag line, the whole thing and reported back, which kicked off the traffic. \n\nThe impatience people have over why SP isn't responding - is comical they can seriously ask that with a straight face. They immediately rallied up and derailed any intelligent discussion with their silly ass presumption there's nothing to it. Even when people were getting replies, they demanded it's not relevant. Then they tried to derail it on every thread...\n\nSo there's that. There's also the reality that the trailer release right up against a weekend and then a national holiday...two days later the south is being blasted by this insane weather likely plays a key role in the lack of immediate or continued replies...and meanwhile, these jackasses are all pissypants that it's not in game so they're disregarding it and they think because SP didn't get on their knees to appease them on their demand, clearly there's no more to it. \n\nSo good luck on whatever trail you're following.", "subreddit": "10cloverfieldlane", "edited": 1453482541, "subreddit_id": "t5_3bw30", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1453482296, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_423ins", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": -3, "retrieved_on": 1454660418, "author": "DelanaQuinn", "controversiality": 0, "ups": -3, "parent_id": "t1_cz7w3ls"}

{"id": "cz8bowb", "body": "I won't be able to take on this project but I can offer some advice as I have roughly 4 years of experience working on the Shopify platform and liquid. \n\n1. Your approach is plausible but it would be more cost effective/efficent to use shopify's built-in customer login system. Instead of letting the password dictate which page the customer goes to you can simply use customer tags and direct the customer to the appropriate landing page after they logged in based on the tag. \n\n\tI would recommend creating a collection (if there are multiple products per store) per store or just a single product for each store. That would make it trivial to match up products with your customers and you can even share tags/products if there is any overlap between customers.\n\t\n\tThis would make it both easier for you to manage and for the programmer to build it since they don't have to setup a custom password scheme (not to mention it would be way more secure). \n\t\n\n2. This is *mostly* possible in shopify in that you can use liquid/javascript to prevent them from clicking the checkout button but there is nothing you can do to stop a knowledgable person from opening up the devleoper console and ajaxing their way into the checkout page. In reality though, this should not be an issue. \n\n3. This is very straightforward and any shopify developer can help you with this.\n\n\n4. Although there isn't an out of the box solution for CMS tasks of this type in Shopify, there are several options here including using a special collections and/or product pages. \n\nEverything you are asking for accomplishable in Shopify and I agree that it can be done within 20-25 hours but unfortunately not for that small of a budget. I'm not saying you can't convince someone to do it for that price but you will almost assuradely be dissappointed with the result.", "subreddit": "shopify", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sn78", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1453502419, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_427obf", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1454667291, "author": "mehphp", "edited": false, "ups": 4, "parent_id": "t3_427obf"}
{"id": "cz8ekey", "body": "OP. you have stumbled into the precise situation where the steam machine makes sense. My situation is somewhat similar, but different and equally applicable. Essentially, we are both edge cases, but mopping up edge cases is kind of what the steam universe initiative is all about.\n\nMy gf had no problem with setting up a pc at the tv. In fact, she liked it too much. The idea was to use it for games because that's what this tv is for. I installed steamos for one day and was like \"gee this works fine for games but it's kind of limiting derp\". So I wiped steamos and installed mint. Well that was nice at first but slowly it started to remind me of why I like consoles better. Instead of something worth doing on our tv and sound system, there was constantly 14 tabs of youtube and shopify sites open on our home theater. Reddit. Facebook. Youtube in 6 inch windows. Forums. Vine. Oh god Vine ***king kill me. A bunch of bullshit that could be done on any one of the 8 other desktops and laptops we have here. Not to mention your damned phone. \n\nSo she loved it and the tv was constantly tied up with personal use crap that not only could have. I'm okay with netflix and youtube, because you can put it on and watch it together. But alot of this stuff is not really a sharing experience. \"Oh, engrossed in makeup shopping I see, I just go play a game... oh sorry do you think you could do that somewhere else so I could play a game?\" \n\nSo after having that conversation every night I just installed steamos and now we can flick it on, pick a game or kiosk and enjoy. And not the couch doesn't turn into a persistent browsing session just because \"I prefer to use this because it's already on.\" So it's invaluable around here. It lets us play pc games and on tv without automatically being a full on desktop on the couch. I actually like it because it's limiting. If for any reason we need a desktop it's available in the options.\n\nSteamos is very nice for a shared tv. \n\nAs for your laptop and it there is any benefit there, I'd say only maintenance. It'll turn into a sort of portable gaming console because you'll never bother with updates or tweaking. Again, technically limiting... but isn't that what a console is? Just a computer limited to playing games? Nonetheless, many people like them.

{"body": "There has been a real flare-up of debate about Ottawa's qualities as a city, possibly in reaction to the upcoming public exhibition of the LeBreton Flats redevelopment scheme.\n\nThis debate strikes me as unfocused, and a little confused. People defending the city cite the high quality of life in Ottawa, which is undeniable, but they fail to respond to the real crux of Cohen's argument, which is that Ottawa is a complacent, unimaginative place. This happens *every time* someone says something critical about Ottawa: inevitably someone will bring up our low crime rate relative to other capitals, which is about the most boring thing you could possibly cheerlead about.\n\nIn Ottawa there's a confluence of suburban parochialism and government (read: NCC) interference that makes it very hard to get away with bare-knuckle urbanism in the same way you might in, say, Toronto or Montreal. There isn't an appetite for riskier, messier things that make big cities exciting. A lot of people just don't like to be challenged, and for them an affordable home and a reasonable commute is sufficient. This is totally fair, but it is these people who firmly rule the roost in Ottawa, for whom both big urban visions *and* small deviations from the norm (try building a sidewalk patio in this city) are kind of an annoyance. \n\nI think Cohen isn't super clear what he's talking about, either. I mean, he's lamenting the lack of boldness and ambition in Ottawa, but then he writes that we should be \"re-examining\" the [Zibi development]---LINK--- based on some hazily-defined opposition from (some) aboriginal groups. But Zibi is just the kind of project that this city needs. I'm not going to say it's imaginative, but it *is* extremely high quality design in a part of the city that will really benefit from redevelopment. The same goes for LeBreton Flats. We don't need to reinvent the wheel here - we don't need a Guggenheim or a national monument - we just need a well designed, dense inner-city neighborhood.\n\nWe can let the innovation come from the little guys, the small businesses and social enterprises. In the last five years Ottawa has seen a ton of progress on this front - boutique hipster stuff, sure, but this stuff builds from the ground up. It's also got major success stories like Shopify. I see the city transforming. It's a gradual process, and sometimes it feels like more of an uphill battle than it needs to be, thanks to whiny neighbours and frequently somnolent staff/leadership, but a sea change is happening.

{"body": "I have one client that does over $500 million in sales a month. The process around 4 million transactions alone. They handle fundraising for most of the schools in North America. \n\n\nIt is not shopify the software that would be taken down, it is the network that shopify is on. When you run any kind of large business you need control of the servers. We know with them, we have to spin up reserves at set times and can spin them down later. I have seen the traffic on their site jump from 10k active users to over 1 million in 10 minutes. Its all about when school gets out on the fundraising and kids start getting home with the information. I doubt that shopify can take a hit like that without a lot of planning. At the same time we load balanced the site across regions with regional displays. Something else shopify could not do. One main reason that it was load balanced across regions is that the goods they sell are non touched until the boxing. So when a user places an order it piped into the right facility based on the load region, printed, came down the line with a label already printed, ready to be boxed and label applied. \n\nThere is a lot of limitations that shopify has, that is just one. I have another large client that has over 65k products. He has many categories and sub categories so you can filter. Shopify only supports top level categories, then tags. We also use the core for A/B testing functionality, something that shopify cannot do either. Sure you can use something like optimizely, that will change the look of a page. But that works on all sites. We A/B test things such as a whole different checkout flow. Figure out which one converts better. Things like that. There are a lot of limitations coming from shopify if you are an ecommerce developer. Sure, it is easy to use and great if you are starting a business. No doubt. But it cannot run the customizations that a lot of businesses need. A for instance. I am quoting a site right now that just sells shipping labels. Not like bulk labels that you can print on, but already printed paid for labels. We need to connect to the carrier API on the frontend and then make the labels available in their account area. We also have to leave orders open until we can connect back into the carrier api, so we can see if the shipment cost more and adjust the charged price. Like say if they gave the weight as 5lbs but put 8lbs in it. So we need to pull the actual amount back into the shop, check against the auth amount and then capture the correct amount. Its impossible to do things like these on SaaS platforms.", "id": "cza8yle", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1453662203, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4270d3", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1454700512, "author": "dh42com", "edited": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_cza8e03"}

{"id": "czbh30h", "body": "I\u2019m a bit late to the party, but I wanted to offer some insight.\n\n(full disclosure: I work for Signifyd.) Everyone needs some level of fraud protection from the start, but the level and type of fraud protection varies based on a few factors. Namely, how much order volume you do, how much traffic your site receives, the industry you\u2019re in (vaping vs. apparel), and the average price of your goods.\n\nFor example, all of the card processors offer a basic level of fraud protection via the AVS and CVV checks they perform. For some merchants, simply confirming the CVV matches may be sufficient for fraud protection. Shopify, and other e-comm platforms, also usually offer a free tool to help you perform standard checks. This may be enough for you since your soon-to-be-built store is so new.\n\nHere's the thing for fraudulent orders: they start coming in when you become popular organically or via advertising (facebook, google ads etc.). When you're more visible online, and more business comes in, the good comes in with the bad. And those that commit fraud attempt to do so anywhere their stolen card information is accepted, and smaller businesses, usually without fraud protection, make a good target.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is the following: in the US, due to our consumer protection laws, the liability of accepting a fraudulent order online is on the merchant. It's your responsibility to suss out the bad orders and not accept them. It sucks, but that's the way it is, so most merchants err on the side of declining too many orders for fear of accepting something that's fraudulent.\n\nAll that being said, for right now, using the AVS/CVV checks your processor offers, or using the free tool from Shopify is likely enough. In our experience, fraud is not so much an \"if\" but a \"when,\u201d and that \u201cwhen\u201d comes into play as you become more popular.\n\nThe time to consider paid fraud detection and prevention tools is when you find yourself spending too much time reviewing orders, you start receiving more chargebacks, or you want to scale your company. At that point, the time you commit to fraud review, the cost of chargebacks or the extra business you bring in (if your intention is to scale) is likely worth more than 1%.\n\nI suggest that as you grow, you keep track of your decline rate (and your chargeback rate, if you have it), and read up on e-commerce fraud. Visa has a pretty good [E-Commerce Merchant\u2019s Guide to Risk Management]---LINK--- that gives a basic overview.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any other fraud questions.

You won't be processing orders any other way other than directly through your shopify store?\n\nYou're looking for a Warehouse and Inventory Management System (WMS) that can communicate with your Order Management System (OMS - Shopify in this case).\n\nFirst thing on your requests is that you need the ability to assign an internal warehouse physical location for each SKU and also it's packaging requirements. \n\nYou then want the ability to automate the order fulfillment process. This means you want someone to physically carry a scanner and the system to automatically deduct inventory as they pack the items. You want the tracking number and other shipping information to automatically populate and complete the orders in Shopify as well?\n\nLast, you want this system to scale with your size so that you can use another warehouse in a different country but still be taking orders through ONE website? Meaning that new warehouse might stock and shelve your items differently and you want the system to know the difference between where item A is at in warehouse 1 or warehouse 2?\n", "id": "czbm0v6", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1453752836, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_42losz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1454724009, "author": "njsdca", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_42losz"}

{"body": "I'm posting with a throwaway account I just created as I don't want to expose my business but I started right here on Reddit about a year ago with $0. \n\nHere is my story:\n\nI found a product that people were interested in, that had great margins and had a few related subreddits.\n\nI found a couple suppliers where I was able to set up wholesale accounts and order from without any kind of MOQs. I then offered group buys right here on Reddit for this product where people would save about 25% off of regular retail price.\n\nI set up a Google Doc and took orders. I would open the \"order taking period\" for like a week, take all the orders and then close it.\n\nI would then invoice people via PayPal, received the money, place the order with the supplier and the product arrived in about a week. I would then ship it out to all the people that ordered and open the next group buy.\n\nTotal turnaround for each \"buy\" was about 3 weeks initially until I built a reputation. Once I did, I was able to cut the time down to 2 weeks as I didn't need to wait for people to get their orders before opening the next one. People would vouch for me in advance.\n\nMy first group buy had 2 orders and I netted $40. The second one was 4 orders, third was 16 orders, then 32 orders, then 36, then 115.\n\nWhen I hit 115 orders, I moved away from Google Docs and put up a simple website that functioned much the same way, but allowed me to take payments automatically with PayPal at the time of the \"pre-order\" so I didn't have to manually invoice everyone. Up to this point, I've invested $0 and made almost $5K.\n\nThe site cost me $9 for the domain and like $20/mo for Shopify. I also invested $50 in a shipping scale and some labels so that I could optimize my shipping. I ran the site like that for 2 months. Up to this point, I've netted almost $10K in pure profit while spending less than $100 out of pocket. \n\nAt that point I decided to launch a \"full time\" e-commerce site. This required inventory. So I took the $10K I've made to this point and put it all into inventory. Fast forward...\n\nI ended the year with a little over $800K in total gross sales and passed the $1mil mark (lifetime sales) shortly after my one-year anniversary.\n\nThis month I'll do around $275K in gross sales and I'm projecting to do $4mil+ in total sales this year.\n\nI've spend a lot of time here learning from others so I decided to give back.

Even if you have something you're giving away for free like information. \n\nI've found the most success by talking to my target market in person. Go where they are, and ask them their opinion. Start with friends of friends if you are worried about coming off slimey. People love to tell you their opinion about stuff, and all you need to do is listen. Order a box of those items and (depending on cost) later you can sell them at cost to people who are interested. \n\nBased on these conversations you will learn who your target market is - and I don't mean a generic \"22 to 27 year old women who like fashion\". You must know the brands your client likes. Where they eat. What they do for fun. Chances are, your product only speaks to someone with a certain style. Find what that is, and your marketing (online and offline) will be stronger. Use their words in your marketing. \n\nThen use your newfound powers and seek out groups where these people hang out online. EG \"Fans of X\" (which strongly correlates to your brand) or the \"Y Lifestyle\" group. See how those other brands market to your demographic and approach them in that way. Most important: How do the other brands make your customer feel? EG luxurious, on trend, etc. Associate that feeling with your product. \n\nAs far as pre-selling is concerned - create some mystique around it. Is it an exclusive product that no one has yet?

{"body": "I run a subscription box with over 600 subscribers in 6 months. Though I will say that I had problems with every platform I've been on.\n\nI decided not go to go to Cratejoy because my margins are very low as it is, so I thought hiding from the fees would be great. Little did I know, there's fees in almost every service you use. All providers will bring down your fees if you bring them enough business.\n\nI started with WooCommerce + Subscription, spent about 300 bucks on all of the plugins that work with their main plugin. I spent a good chunk on the development as well since I wanted some customizations that I wasn't comfortable doing myself. WooCommerce wasn't great at playing with caching and I ended up having my site crash on launch (losing probably around 100-200 potential signups). After such a big push (and a few grand lost) in my pre-launch...I was pissed to say the least.\n\nBefore the first month was over, I was irate at WooCommerce...the support sucked, there's not that many reasonably priced developers that could look into it with success (site was still going slow under load). I ended up moving to Shopify.\n\nI am still on Shopify + ReCharge at the minute and Clayton over there is awesome (seriously he answers your e-mails so fast and will help you out with any transitions). Keep in mind when you move to Shopify, it's all coded in Liquid (ruby based code), so you may have to pick up some of this to transfer over, or hire a developer (which are overpriced on Shopify in my eyes). I was quoted over 2k to move just the design over, but ended up learning some Liquid on my own and did it in 2 weeks.\n\nReCharge will take a fee, similarly to Cratejoy, but you can usually talk them down within the first few months. Overall my experience with Shopify has been really good - though ReCharge is definitely limited on what customization you can do (especially anything that revolves around the checkout). Plus, everything runs through their servers and at times I found that it was really slow page load times. Though I've emailed about this and they are supposedly working on increasing load.\n\nIf you want to run promotions, give discounts for buying multiple subscriptions, or offer affiliate programs - you will get hit with more fees (or at least a base monthly fee) on top of ReCharge. Keep this in mind because CrateJoy offers that all in their program - and if you ever plan to do it in the future the fees can actually overtake what CrateJoy's are.\n\nOverall, I think Cratejoy offers a ton of good features, but I didn't like what I had read about them in the short term. I, too, was focused on all of the costs and possible pain in the ass it would be to switch over to a different platform later on. That's why I didn't go with them; I've realized over the months of running it that the costs are going to be around the same elsewhere (possibly even more). And, if you want to switch later it will cost a good chunk in developer fees if you don't know much about web design.\n\nTL;DR: Most places will have fees that will cut into profits - and if you want more features added into non-cratejoy platforms, it will usually add up in fees/costs as well. Decide what you want now and stick with it, otherwise you may be looking at big developer costs.", "id": "czgruw3", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1454097843, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4393qa", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "ups": 3, "author": "Craigasaurous", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1454813253, "parent_id": "t3_4393qa"}

Surely the customer can use others, if they feel more comfortable with it. I'd use Twitter if I want to say something short and quick, email if I want to say something longer, and forum if I want to hear what others have to say about something.\n\nWhich reminds me that I've been stuck in the mindset that this forum will be mainly used for problem-solving. That's not necessarily the case. We can build an actual community (\"tribe\") out of it!\n\n&gt; a community could enable other users to give them a friendly love-tap i.e 'Hey, you never uploaded any screenshots for them to see, they're not going to be able to help you without those'\n\nExactly... at the risk that this 'nudge' may be worsening their mood, if the customer is a particularly sensitive one, or if they've been frustrated enough already :)\n\n&gt; ARCHIVE ALL THE THINGS\n\nYes, but we gotta be discreet in how we direct people to these archives. In my experience we eventually end up answering the question anyway, with an addendum of \"you can check this FAQ out to learn more.\" It really doesn't 'feel' right to not answer the question, 0%, and instead direct them to some other place.\n\nI dunno, I guess some customers are more independent than others.\n\n&gt; Things that exist in the gray area between departments often always get lost in the ethos, so this is a big one to define.\n\nI agree. Back to the \"100% support\" criteria :)\n\n&gt; Do you think it benefits social/content marketers in the fact that their tools are all the same and everyone starts at 0 (i.e. everyone uses the same Twitter, FB, Medium, etc)\n\nWell it's neither beneficial nor detrimental. When it comes to customer support, it's not a battle between brands :)\n\nWe just use whatever media our customers are at (and most likely want to use to contact us). It's beneficial when they can contact us easily, and detrimental if they can't.\n\n&gt; If everyone creates their own online community that looks/functions in a different manor, I dont think there will ever be an industry dedicated to pushing the category forward.\n\nWell, I'm not sure. For one, there's not much difference between brand-centric community forum and just, well, plain old community forum. And there's lots of softwares for forums.\n\nIf Voat can use Reddit's code and build their own discussion forum, I'm sure any brand can do the same :)  \n(Though I'm not sure Reddit's way of doing things is simple enough for the average customer.. what with the sorting and the upvotes etc.)\n\nThough, I don't know.

{"body": "These business models imho are not at all similar. I also don't see why were talking about having 15k startup money since dropshipping cost at most is like $29 for a shopify store, you don't need money so for dropshipping the money is irrelevant. REally in my opinion the only reason anyone should drop ship is because you have 0 dollars to start or you dont live in the USA and its your only option Personally I hate dropshipping as a concept and think unless someone lives outside the USA and dropshipping is the only model should almost never be done. Margins on dropshipping are terrible typically. Reaosn being your not ordering bulk/wholesale which is where good prices come in. YOur ordering one piece at a time so your essentially retail. Add to that the dropshipper is doing all the work for you so they are also going to charge for order fullfilment or processing on top of the poor price your already getting. Lastly, you lose control of your business. Every package that I sell Ipersonally ship out. I know where my packages are, I can answer customer inquiries, I know my inventory, etc. Lastly with ecommerce sometimes you have to take losses. Maybe an ebay or amazon customers claims an item wasnt delivered even though it clearly was. Regardless of the truth the customer is gonna wind and you're gonna take the loss. Lets say your selling an item for $10. The guy dropshipping wel say pays $8 and makes $2 profit per item. The guy who holds inventory pays $2 and sells it for $10 making an $8 profit. If an item gets lost in the mail, customer plays games, etc the guy who pays $2 per item thats nothing to him on one sale he made enough to buy 5 more items so he's still in the green. The guy who drop ships is out $8 worth of product and because he makes such small margins he has to sell 4 more items just to recoup what he lost. That is why dropshipping is terrible especially with high dollar items because one bad sale will wipe out the next 8 or 10 good sales where one bad sale to someone making good margins is nothing.
