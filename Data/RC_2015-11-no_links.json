{"body": "* **Name** ---LINK--- / ---LINK---\n\n* **What/Why?** It is an app for Shopify stores. It solves a lot of discount/coupon problems. First, it allows you to add coupons in cart, that show the discount upfront without having to go to checkout, so less abandoned carts. Then, it allows way more powerful coupons than Shopify's admin. You can have a coupon for any imaginable (yes, really) discount. Third, it also lets you create discounts/offers/sales/etc. So basically this single app replaces dozens of half-hearted other apps. It also does so without cluttering your products with countless variants. Pretty magical, if we may say so ourselves! ---LINK---\n\n* **More...** Well, the app's in beta but was tested for almost a year internally. Now we are doing external testing. Funding isn't an issue. All the founders are putting in their own money.\n\n* **Looking for...** Basically feedback from Shopify store-owners. What will it take for them to try this app. Whether they like the idea or not. Stuff like that. Also, how we can improve our video. We realize it's not the best.\n\n* **Reddit discount** We'll give you a longer trial period and install the app for free. Not really sure what else we can do, but talk to us and we can work it out. The app's in beta so not everything's set in stone.

I think their approach is probably the safest and relatively easiest to implement. The alternative is worse (and the problem that Italian Barber faced when he tried to sell his limited release razors on his old platform): people would add the razors to their cart and would rush through the order system until they got an error when they tried to submit their order since the item was out of stock by the time they clicked submit.

This relies on Shopify to have support for this exact function, though.\n\n* You could just ask people to sign up ahead of time to be notified, and go off of that. The downside here is that not everyone who signs up will be committed to the purchase, and people who hear about it late might still want to buy, so you'll be off in both directions by an uncertain amount, although if you did this enough you might get a good grasp on how off they are and in what direction from the trends.\n\nNothing great really. I guess the simplest way is to just make more and hope for the best. \n\nI'm more surprised that Shopify can put such restrictions on you, though.

If people buy less than 3 and leave, you let in more people, but never more than what's available.\n\nYou could do the same thing but by time stamp instead of random, but that means you will have a giant bandwidth spike when the Waiting Room opens - not good if your hosting provider can't support the load because everything will just hang.\n\nBTW, Comic Con sells over 200,000 tickets in 45 minutes, and there are about 3-4x that many people who don't get tickets.

[---LINK--- \n\n&gt;Bitcoin has begun to play a larger role in our business and we are proud to be commencing our next phase of development!\n\n&gt;The Bitcoin community has been a blessing by helping us optimise our online stall. The community has been my favourite to work alongside. Not only have we developed the business but have also made some great friends and business partners in Australia and across the world!\n\n&gt;All of the suggestions through our previous post were well received and went on to shape how we do things. Thank you for participating and helping us in areas we had struggled. :) \n\n&gt;Our next step within the crypto-currency space is to increase our Bitcoin sales and become a model business using our BTC as a financial instrument within the ecosystem, growing our position.\n\n&gt;Bitcoins are not only useful for transacting. The ecosystem is loaded with opportunity! Coins can be compounded through swap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, loans and mining contracts. With our fiat payments, we are limited. \n\n&gt;Our plan is to release statistics mid 2016 supporting claims that Bitcoin is most beneficial to business. We will do a direct comparison to our fiat payments and be able to show supporting data.\n\n&gt;**Positive adoption:**\n\n&gt;The addition of the Bitcoin \u00e2\u20ac\u0153B\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to our packaging (140,000 units) has been a success! Many people have been asking us about Bitcoin, how to access more information and even wanting to buy some! \n\n&gt;The Bitcoins we receive through our sales are reinvested back into the ecosystem. If they are not in Storage they will be compounding in swaps, loans or mining contracts.\n\n&gt;**Integration:**\n\n&gt;The integration was a success and now you can find our online stall accepting Bitcoin seamlessly through our cart. We went ahead with the Shopify re-build as so many of you were suggesting and it works a treat!\n  [---LINK---  Theres also a %10 discount code for you guys \"bitcoin\"  ;)\n\n&gt;If there are any suggestions, let us know.\n\n&gt;**The Company**\n\n&gt;Since our last post 6 months ago we have been busy bees! \n\n&gt;We have set up our factory and have grown our business through local markets and our online sales. Very shortly we will commence our wholesale and you will find us stocked across supermarkets and retailers throughout Australia. This had taken longer than expected but nothing goes according to plan!\n\n&gt;There has been so much hard work going in to the business and it feels like we haven't slept much the last 6 months! Check out some of our feedback:\n [---LINK--- \n\n&gt; [---LINK--- \n\n&gt;I need your thoughts on how to best increase our Bitcoin interest. We are searching for creative ways to build this side of the e-commerce. \n\n&gt;We are open to suggestions and need your help to optimise our store. We want to accommodate for the Bitcoin users around the world. What are your thoughts on how to improve BTC orders? You guys are brutally honest and thats what we need right now.\n\n&gt;By mid next year we will have enough data to produce a detailed report on how effective BTC was for our business. By showing the sales, interest on swap earnings and mining contract data we will prove without doubt the effectiveness of crypto-currency for profitability. Using some basic charts in comparison to fiat, BTC will prove to be most favourable!\n\n&gt;Hopefully we can generate some buzz out of this and encourage others to follow in our footsteps  :D\n\n&gt;**What do you think?**\n\n&gt;OCD JERKY", "subreddit": "BitcoinAll", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_39m7n", "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": "1446734603", "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3rmsrj", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1449613899, "author": "BitcoinAllBot", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_3rmsrj"}

{"body": "If you're only paying yourself $10/hr for artisanal labor, you're *woefully* undercharging for your skills. \n\nWhat you really need to do is take the actual, irreducible costs, multiply by about 250-400%, and see if the resulting hourly rate works for you. \n\nIn this case, you'd be looking at about $75-120, which is pretty similar to the estimate provided elsewhere in the comments. In the case of jewelry, I would lean on the higher end of that spectrum. Anyone telling you \"I wouldn't even pay $30 for that\" is not part of your target market and you can safely ignore them.\n\nAt $75, if you get it right on the first try you're making $11.25/hr before non-material expenses. If you totally mess up, or something is lost in the mail and not covered by insurance, or whatever, you're making $3.75/hr. That \"if something goes wrong\" bit is a large part of why you want to do at least 250% material cost margin; you don't want to ever be *losing* money for doing work.\n\nAt $120, you're looking at $22.50/hr if all goes well and $15/hr if something goes wrong. Keep in mind, again, that this is all before expenses. Further keep in mind that if this is your career, you can multiple those numbers by approximately 2,000 to see your annual rates. $30k-45k/year for a professional jeweler is still pretty damn low. \n\nMy best advice here is to learn how to work faster. The real mark of a professional artisan isn't just the ability to make kickass stuff, it's the ability to make kickass stuff *quickly and reliably*. This is true for all disciplines, from jewelry to cooking. \n\nYou can also lower the material costs. You're buying materials from Michael's? Holy shit. They're *great* for prototyping because you can buy stuff *now* and you can see exactly what you're getting (I still use them from time to time for things), but you'll be hard pressed to make a profitable business using them as a routine, primary supplier. I guarantee you can get cheaper materials elsewhere if you buy in even reasonable bulk. Yes, an extremely important and unavoidable part of running a business is spending a meaningful amount of time finding a good supplier for materials. They have entire trade shows just for that. \n\nFinally, don't forget to factor non-material costs into your pricing. Consider Etsy's fee (or Shopify or whatever), the payment processing fees (PayPal, credit cards, etc.), the listing fees, the time cost of marketing, website maintenance, money spent on professional photography or anything else you need to promote, and self-employment taxes (which are like 12.5%+). This also means DON'T give out free shipping; charge what shipping costs plus like $2 for packaging and related materials (boxes, bubble wrap, mailing label, tape, \"Fragile\" stickers, etc.). \n\nGood luck!

{"body": "Couple of things worth mentioning--Magento isn't a great [easy simple to use] content management system.  If you're looking for easy editing of content, you might want to use WordPress and hook it up on a subdomain.\n\n\nIf you really need custom css/js on a per page basis AND want to include them as files rather than inline, you'll need to use the custom layout xml tab on CMS pages.  Here's the gist of it:\n\n    &lt;reference name=\"head\"&gt;\n        &lt;action method=\"addJs\"&gt;\n            &lt;script&gt;custom.js&lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;/action&gt;\n        &lt;action method=\"addCss\"&gt;\n            &lt;stylesheet&gt;css/custom.css&lt;/stylesheet&gt;\n        &lt;/action&gt;\n    &lt;/reference&gt;\n\nThen you'll need to upload those resources to skin/frontend/{package}/{theme}/{js|css}\n\n&gt;The HTML editor under Page Information &gt;&gt; Content does not seem all inclusive as certain things seem to be overwritten.\n\nIf you're just looking to throw some things inline, you can do that too but I always recommend that you disable the WYSIWYG editor as I've certainly seen it garble things.\n    Configuration-&gt;General-&gt;Content Management-&gt;Enable WYSIWYG Editor-&gt;No\n\n&gt;Is it imperative that I use themes? \n\nIt all depends on what you're trying to accomplish.  If you're happy with the default Magento theme out of the box then why bother installing another?  I can't imagine this ever being true for any of our clients, but I'm open to the concept that not everyone's needs are the same.  If you desire another look and feel, you'll definitely want to either build a theme yourself or install one.  Based on the nature of your questions, it looks like you're in for a steep learning curve either way.\n\n&gt;Is it imperative that I use the xml page layout system? (I would rather not). I attempted to google these problems, most solutions seem to be downloading third party themes rather than making them yourself. Is it possible to make your own themes?\n\nAt one point or another you're probably going to want to change something that will require a layout xml change.  Yes, you can make your own theme, but it will take a while and you'll need a fairly intimate knowledge of Magento.\n\n\n\nIf I were you, I'd take a step back and try to figure out what the job to be done is.  If having content is a really high priority and selling products is something you'll just get to and don't need a high degree of customization, you might want to look into a hosted solution like Shopify.", "id": "cwqpvy8", "subreddit": "Magento", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qx9e", "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": "1446824353", "author_flair_text": "DEVELOPER-DCJ Cool Tools", "link_id": "t3_3rpmp9", "author_flair_css_class": "", "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "treefunct", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1449636629, "parent_id": "t3_3rpmp9"}

{"id": "cwqrjia", "body": "the 'Shop' and 'Products' links both result in the same page. That's confusing to me. Choose one? Or change 'Shop' to activities maybe?    \n     \nThe pagination on product pages could be easier to see. It is hidden between the last row of products and the 'popular' list. I always prefer an option to 'show all' because clicking through 3 pages of 10 products each is a pain. As you get more products - sorting may be helpful too. \n\nOn a product page - the 'back' link is again towards the bottom. I would expect that to be higher up for easy finding. The 'related items' section seems to be in the way - although I do see the need for it, so maybe it's just fine.     \n     \nI clicked on a picture and expected a zoomed version. It came up in a new view - exactly the same size. This is one of my biggest pet-peeves for gear sites. Don't give me the option to zoom if you don't have a larger version of the image. Especially when it takes a second or 2 to load that non-zoomed version.     \n     \nI don't understand what the red boxes that say 'save $xx' mean. Are these items for sale on your site? Where they were $xx higher last week? Or is this $xx cheaper on your site vs a competitor? Seems confusing - but I see why you would want to highlight sale items.     \n      \nAfter I created an account - I expect to be brought to 'my account' page. Instead - I was brought back to the 'login' page. Minor inconvenience, but worth looking into.    \n      \nUS doesn't really have 'Province'. I understand it means State based on the context (Alabama is pre-populated, which also isn't my liking). Maybe if US is selected, you could change that text to 'State'. Or even better - I love when I enter my zipcode into a site and it auto populates the city/state. May be too much integration for you now.     \n    \nIn the 'about' section I like to see location. Where is this company based and ideally how do they give back to the local community.     \n      \nThe 'cart' page being just a pop-out from the full site is odd.

{"body": "Shopify is fine. It is made for this kind of project so I think that you are on the right path and hopefully things will work out for you. Having said that, here are a few things I noticed:\n\nDesign\n\n1. Having different size images in the spinner gallery makes the entire site pops up/down vertically. That should not be the case. It makes it really hard to read while the site moves around on its own. Make sure to unify all the gallery images in size [they all should have the same height]. \n\n2. Your footer actually overflows. it is either the CSS or the HTML that makes the social buttons and footer links list overflow outside of the footer itself.\n\n3. A designer/UX guy can give you better feedback on this but I think that having the order form at the bottom leads to less conversion than having it higher up. IIRC there are a ton of stats/studies about this kind of stuff that you can find and apply.\n\n4. I think that this font would fit your site perfectly. In my experience the font does very well for white bg sites ---LINK--- \n\n\nYou can probably get better feedback from a real designer but these things are pretty common and you can start working on them right away. \n\nIn terms of tech, your load time is consumed by the images. So the first call to your site takes longer than all subsequent calls because the browser caches the images. 700ms is a rather good number for a shopify site so you are good to go. If you want to make things a bit faster, try smaller images and see if that helps! \n\nI hope this was of help.

PLUS, you can start making small batches, without a huge outlay.\n\nHere's an example. You know those essential oil reed-diffuser things? They sell for what, $4-10 each? It's just a glass jar, lavender/orange/sandlewood essential oil, and some sticks... maybe $1 in materials, if that. Make a whole bunch, print off some brown-paper Avery sticky labels and head down to your local Saturday markets.\n\nGive out business cards for your shopify website ($20 a month), with a \"buy 4 diffusers and we'll ship them to you for free\". Hell, you can sign them up for a monthly subscription, to keep every room in their house smelling GREAT for $40 a month! \nPostage is $8, materials come to $5, that's $27 in your pocket.\n\nI'm putting out really shitty examples, but you can see where I'm going. Find something to make that you enjoy, and try to sell it!", "id": "cwtbryc", "subreddit": "australia", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8e", "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": "1447020356", "author_flair_text": "", "link_id": "t3_3rxw30", "author_flair_css_class": "sa", "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "InertiaCreeping", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1449681657, "parent_id": "t1_cwt5vac"}

Wordpress has grown to the point where it is so diverse you can use it for multiple options. As far as ecommerce goes I have not yet tried it but it is definitely possible because the various apps they have ready to be used like \"WooCommerce\".\n\n2. In my experience with WordPress I used Optimizepress which is a very helpful piece of software that is mostly used for internet marketing but can still be helpful for other sites too. The software creates landing pages, webinar registration forms, and more. You can even create home pages that compete against top competitors in your niche. Your knowledge of HTML/CSS can definitely kick it up here.\n\n3. Shopify is what I use currently for my clothing business. I just started out and I'm still getting the hang of it but it's definitely worth it. For someone just starting out I think it's the only safe option, provided you can afford it.

I can pull in all orders from all shops that I have on Etsy, Ebay, Amazon, Shopify, Bonanza, etc. into one location and print all my labels at once.

I started out with stamps.com and now have a free stamps.com account through shipstation so you can grow into these things once you have the orders to justify it.

Can be done, and apart from agreeing with the 'do I have time' part above, there are many advantages to doing it yourself. Here's my one tip:\n\nVersion control. ALWAYS make sure you can revert to previous versions, and make sure you know which version to revert to. Especially important if you don't know what you're doing. Just because something seems ok now doesn't mean you won't realise in a months time that you've rooted something and need to revert to like five versions ago when you messed with that thing and you can't remember what you did. \n\nTo do this, every time you make a change, copy and rename the theme with a version number. Keep a spreadsheet that records what changes were made in each revision and when the changes were made. Trust me. Do this religiously. \n\nAnything else you can figure out.

{"body": "Absolutely!\n\nThere are a couple ways to go about it, and it depends on what your priority is. If you need specific features and specific systems, it's different than if your priority is getting the lowest pricing. \n\n**If you need specific features**\nThis is the quickest way, but not always the most cost-efficient. If you need something very specific, you can find the features or systems (usually equipment) that will do what you want, and then see which processors can support that equipment. Mostly this only affects specialty businesses. For example, many dentist's offices like to use a system called Dentrix for practice management and patient records. Dentrix can also take credit cards, but ONLY if the dentist's office chooses to process card payments through a company called PowerPay. So, obviously, PowerPay knows they're the sole processor that works with Dentrix, and they don't have to compete based on cost. It will usually cost dentists more to process with PowerPay, but they do it if they want to integrate credit card processing with Dentrix.\n\nSometimes, equipment companies have *preferred* processors, but that doesn't necessarily mean you HAVE to work with them. For example, if you use QuickBooks, Intuit might try to get you to use their merchant services. You don't HAVE to though, because other processors offer plug-ins and exporting to QuickBooks. \n\nMost of the time, it's very unlikely that the average business needs something so specific that a traditional processor can't support it. But there's misinformation and businesses THINK that they need something they assume is specific, but is actually fairly common.\n\nExamples of things that traditional processors have that business people are surprised by:\n\n* Mobile device/smartphone processing (that's not limited to Square!)\n* Compatibility with your current equipment \n* Ecommerce solutions/hosted payment pages/\"buy\" buttons for your website (You don't HAVE to use Shopify or Volusion or WooCommerce..)\n\nSo, moral here, if you need something very specific, you'll need to work with processors who support the thing you need, BUT most of the time it's not actually something that requires one specific processor.\n\n\n**If your priority is lowest pricing**\nIf you want the lowest pricing (and don't we all?) you'll usually want to find a processor that offers what's called interchange plus pricing with true pass-through. What this means is that the processor will charge you the actual cost to process the transaction, and then add their markup. This makes everything transparent, and helps you ensure you're getting a good deal. \n\nWhat you DON'T want is \"tiered\" or \"bundled\" pricing, which is when you'll see those things like \"qualified\" and \"non-qualified\" credit cards. That's a quick way to overpay. \n\nRather than repost a primer, I'm gonna link to one that was written in r/smallbusiness about the basics of processing, which goes over the pricing models in more detail: ---LINK---\n\nSo there are a few ways to go about finding interchange-plus processors who offer true pass-through. You can visit their websites, call them and get quotes, keep a spreadsheet of it all, and basically hate your life and get confused.. or you can use a site (like ours!) that will do the math for you and compare apples to apples in one place. But my intention with this post isn't to be all \"sales-y\" so I'm gonna keep the mention of our site to a minimum and if anyone has specific questions about that I'm happy to answer in PM.\n\n\nAnother thing to consider is your average transaction total.\n\n**If you have a small average transaction total** By small total, I'm talking under $10 per purchase on average. For something like that, companies like Square or PayPal are often your best bet. Why? The way their pricing is structured, you're likely going to pay less than you would with a traditional processor. In some cases, the processor might even be helping subsidize your processing! (That's what happened when Square was the processor for Starbucks. Square lost millions because they charged their flat rate, which was less than what they had to pay to process the transaction. Oops.)\n\nHowever, if you DON'T have small transactions, processing through Square, PayPal, or the 2.75% - 2.9% type processors is almost definitely going to be more expensive. \n\n\nSo, this is all the long way of saying \"It depends.\" Finding the best processor for your business depends on 1) Your volume and transaction size and 2) Your specific needs equipment or feature-wise (if any).\n\nOne additional caveat is that credit card processing is a very difficult area to get worthwhile \"reviews\" from others. The reason being, it's not guaranteed that you're getting the same deal as that person. If your business does more transactions, less transactions, more American Express, more debit, less debit, whatever... you could be paying a different rate than Joe Business Owner who swears up and down that Processor X is amazing and gives great deals. Heck, you could call some of these processors on Monday and get different rates and fees than if you call on Tuesday! So read reviews, but take them with a grain of salt because you might not be getting the \"same product\" and thus the review could be completely worthless.\n\nThe \"best\" processing solution is very business-specific. I know, not exactly the most helpful thing ever, but hopefully the other bits in this reply have given a starting point!

{"id": "cwwwcfz", "body": "Hey! I'm the mod at /r/squarespace. It's a hosted SaaS platform much like Wordpress.com or Shopify.com. They give full front end access for design, paired to a well-designed backend UI that only has a few customization options for you as the developer. The platform is pretty modern, and essentially every Squarespace website is a JSON API. The templating language is a fork of JSON-T. Ex: ---LINK--- There's a built-in Commerce platform that leverages the same UI and templating, but the Checkout page is securely hosted which offloads PCI compliance. It's the same setup Shopify uses.\n\nI use localhost development every day via the unofficial open source Node Squarespace Server project: ---LINK--- You can use your own build system. For instance, mine is largely a NPM build system with all the dev goodies like Sass, ES6, Webpack w/ Babel, etc. Squarespace works with front end frameworks like Angular and React if you want to take it that far or integrate it into another platform/app. The reason hardcore devs dislike it is because you can't read/write directly to the database. You're using Squarespace's database, with the template language to access data. There are numerous benefits to this including zero maintenance to the backend stuff and Squarespace's 24/7 support for the underlying platform/UI. Adversely, there are some drawbacks\u2013 no inbound API to read/write to Squarespace, no server side scripting, no development roadmap from Squarespace, no user accounts. This all is subject to change because Squarespace is constantly adding more features.\n\nSquarespace is great for marketing websites, blogs, portfolios, landing pages, stores, etc. Obviously you're not building the next Airbnb on it yet. You can customize the design however you want so the only reason a website looks like a Squarespace template is because the designer lacked the skills to customize it. \n\nSquarespace's official \"Answers\" community, ---LINK--- is not too active, but I'm trying to build the community with all my initiatives\u2013 Reddit, Slack developer community with over 900 registered members, monthly local events in NY, live coding, developer training, etc.\n\nI use Squarespace because it's better for many projects.

And you guessed it right: these things end with few hundreds of hours of work and no sales. \n\n     I suggest to delay these \"long-term things\" and go lean till you know how your customer will come to your store (via Adwords, FB ads, Affiliate or Other). After you have tried to build the traffic yourself and the sales are rolling (at least a few every day with positive ROI), then, and only then, it's time to think about earlier serious stuff. \n\n*  You can start a simple full-category shop with ~$60 (Shopify Basic: $29, thousands of drop ship products from AliExpress via Ali Importer: $29, + trials). Launch a shop for 60 USD, test some ads for 100 USD (I would start with Facebook definitely) and see how it is going.

I do have a couple of little questions, if you didn't mind?\n\nThe thing I was most surprised about was your use of Aliexpress. That was one of the first sites I came across while trying to get into this business and I thought it looked amazing. Recently I read Shopify's guide for dropshipping, and it's description of identifying wholesalers made me believe Aliexpress was actually a wholesale-retailer, which you then corroborated in your video. This made me feel like I shouldn't use it for sourcing wholesale products, am I wrong in thinking this?\n\nAlso, I'm yet to do the research for how to get it done, but I assume that private labelling cannot be done for every product. Specifically I had in mind clothing; for example, you're selling a rainbow coloured T-shirt and there isn't really a place where your own label can be printed on it, there's not really an ability to get it privately labelled? I know you would be able to still sell the shirt online as \"xBrand T-shirt\", but there is nothing physical setting it apart from the other shirts sourced from the same place. Is this still private labelling/do you think doing it this way would work?\n\nThanks again, and if you do choose to answer I greatly appreciate it.

You haven't even seen it yet, how do you claim otherwise?\n\nIt also allows users to not be forced to purchase a domain and web-hosting or configure anything manually.\n\nYou like to harp on the point that Google already indexes stores, but you can't pretend that simply the act of having an ecommerce store on the web means that you'll show up in Google search results, except possibly on the 5,000,000 page which no one ever sees, as my colleague Chris points out in [his post]---LINK---\n\nAlso, you mislead people when mentioning how a 'special browser' must be used. We use an URI scheme such that OB links can be posted anywhere on the web. Product discovery can take place over the existing web infrastructure and doesn't need to happen in the client interface entirely.\n\n&gt;&gt;OpenBazaar requires no web hosting and no manual configuration of anything, just download and install.\n\n&gt;This is false on its face. And even if it were true, when was the last time you had to setup hosting or manually configure Amazon.com in order to shop on it?\n\nThis isn't false on it's face, how would you know how OB installation takes place? It's incredibly easy. Amazon doesn't offer a decentralized free shopping app for download or I'd be using it for sure.\n\n&gt;&gt;Shopify is not a network of users.\n\n&gt;Then who uses it? Is it a network of robots or are those people selling there real people and the people buying there real buyers? Even if that were the case, if you want a selling network based on compassion, you can go to Etsy.\n\nI think you know what I meant here. Shopify stores don't connect to each other peer to peer. They rely on multiple third parties to operate are centrally controlled and you need to pay to use them.\n\n&gt;&gt;OpenBazaar is a community of people who can engage in trade directly with each other anywhere in the world using only their computers, the OpenBazaar software, and Bitcoin.\n\n&gt;So is the internet.\n\nYes, and we are building a protocol and client to make this process easier for them to do. The mere existence of TCP/IP doesn't mean it's a simple process to buy and sell things with other people on the internet. It's not easy to engage in direct trade with other people online, and we're building something to make it easy.\n\n&gt;&gt;OpenBazaar isn't a panacea, nor will the first version be perfect. Skepticism is warranted, but simply labeling it a shitty version of an existing product isn't accurate or fair. Wait until it's released and had time for adoption - at the very least - before passing judgement.\n\n&gt;OB, as it is proposed in its final form, is as revolutionary as a purple turd. It is certainly unique, and no one has ever seen anything like it. But it's useless and stinky. There is a reason the internet doesn't look like OB. And what's more, OB is as censorable as the internet, which is a whole other discussion. If you don't like the internet, that's well and good, the solution isn't to make another internet with all the same problems of the current internet.\n\nYou're free to make as many assertions as you like about OB. You can try to provoke us developers as much as you like. Ultimately actions speak louder than words, and the revealed preferences of the market don't care what you or I think about any of this.\n\nI'm not pretending OB is perfect and I'm not pretending that it will overthrow existing centralized markets entirely, or that it will be adopted by millions overnight. But it does give people the option to engage in trade directly with other people online, and that's something I'm confident that lots of people want. I want to help give it to them.\n\n**Edit**: And I didn't even mention the fact that OpenBazaar allows for a free market in moderation using 2-of-3 multisig with trusted third parties holding the third key. Those third parties are selected on a marketplace and can set their own terms and their own fees, instead of being forced to rely on the dispute resolution services of whatever platform you're using (or Shopify, which doesn't even offer them at all).", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": "1447539573", "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3stcgc", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "ups": 2, "author": "CC_EF_JTF", "edited": 1447541490, "retrieved_on": 1449802203, "parent_id": "t1_cx0a1b8"}

{"body": "&gt; Now you switch from comparing OpenBazaar to Shopify to comparing it to a non-existent company that might exist in the future? That's hardly compelling.\n\nOh, does Popify sound just like Shopify to you? That wasn't intended. This was just a thought experiment. :)\n\n&gt;Shopify doesn't let you accept Bitcoin directly, but only works with either Coinbase or Bitpay. Setting that up requires users to mess with API keys and payment gateways and of course you must register your personal information with those companies and pay them any associated fees if they charge any. Whereas with OpenBazaar you accept the coins directly, no reliance on third parties, and it's way easy to set up.\n\nOk, so the advantage of OB is that you can pick your BTC address? I hope you don't spend all your money implementing this incredibly revolutionary feature.\n\n&gt; The vast majority of users on Shopify pay transaction fees, and I've already pointed out in the previous response why using Bitcoin over OpenBazaar is a better experience than Shopify.\n\nIf it's better, which I doubt, it's probably like 1% better. Moreover, the reason the vast majority of users pay Shopify transaction fees is because a majority of buyers pay with credit cards because Bitcoins are not usually used.\n\n&gt; The OpenBazaar experience of downloading and installing the server and client is substantially better than Magento or Shopify or any web-hosted service. You haven't even seen it yet, how do you claim otherwise?\n\nHow can this be possible when hosted Shopify and Magento are setup by filling out a form? Moreover, if you think that setting up OB on an external server is going to be easier than using a shopify or magento installation, then you're nuts.\n\n&gt; It also allows users to not be forced to purchase a domain and web-hosting or configure anything manually.\n\nSo OB is an advantage because you don't need to have a domain? Hahaha!\n\n&gt;You like to harp on the point that Google already indexes stores, but you can't pretend that simply the act of having an ecommerce store on the web means that you'll show up in Google search results, except possibly on the 5,000,000 page which no one ever sees, as my colleague Chris points out in his post.\n\nAnd if OB is successful, you would have this exact same problem. Just to give you your own idiotic critique back in simple English. You believe that the internet is a bad place for businesses because there are too many people there.\n\n&gt; Also, you mislead people when mentioning how a 'special browser' must be used. We use an URI scheme such that OB links can be posted anywhere on the web. Product discovery can take place over the existing web infrastructure and doesn't need to happen in the client interface entirely.\n\nAnd how would one get to these URIs? Oh! That's right! You would need to have the OB browser on your computer and it would open. This is like saying that you can use skype right in your browser because you can click a link that will open the application for you. Blatant lie.\n\n&gt; This isn't false on it's face, how would you know how OB installation takes place? It's incredibly easy. Amazon doesn't offer a decentralized free shopping app for download or I'd be using it for sure.\n\nOk, so we get to the crux of it. You would use Amazon's decentralized free shopping app because you are building this out of an entitlement ideology, not because this is more efficient. OB isn't decentralized. It isn't uncensorable in the slightest. Also, your statement is false on its face. Open Bazaar is going to be a downloadable browser that allows you to access only a non-http based portion of the web. You missed the point entirely, which doesn't surprise me. My point in saying that you don't need to configure Amazon in order to get on it is to say that this isn't a feature of any application. The web is seamless and wonderful, and easy to get from place to place. Moreover, you are ignoring the fact that for any store of any size, you will have to host it on a third party server like AWS. So... tell me now that OB is going to be easy to setup for people with traffic.\n\n&gt; I think you know what I meant here. Shopify stores don't connect to each other peer to peer. They rely on multiple third parties to operate are centrally controlled and you need to pay to use them.\n\nSo start a website. Oh... in OB you don't need a domain... I forgot. So the advantage of OB is that you don't need to pay $7.50 every year to purchase a domain. You don't need to pay them unless you want to take advantage of the tech they have spent many man years building for great seller/user experience.\n\n&gt; Yes, and we are building a protocol and client to make this process easier for them to do. The mere existence of TCP/IP doesn't mean it's a simple process to buy and sell things with other people on the internet. It's not easy to engage in direct trade with other people online, and we're building something to make it easy.\n\nYou have to be an idiot if you do not believe that buying and selling on the internet is easy. I don't think you're an idiot, so I'll just chock this up to a simple lie.\n\n&gt; You're free to make as many assertions as you like about OB. You can try to provoke us developers as much as you like. Ultimately actions speak louder than words, and the revealed preferences of the market don't care what you or I think about any of this.\n\nI agree with this. I'm entering my critiques into the Telos of Christ and you will have to look at them constantly as your project implodes as a result of every thing I have outlined here and in previous posts. I have asked questions of the project, been forced to squeeze answers out of you guys, and have finally come to my conclusions. If you survive it won't be because you created something revolutionary, it will be because your users are ideologues who want to use Open Bazaar for no reason other than to signal to their Libertarian friends how hip they are.\n\n&gt; I'm not pretending OB is perfect and I'm not pretending that it will overthrow existing centralized markets entirely, or that it will be adopted by millions overnight. But it does give people the option to engage in trade directly with other people online, and that's something I'm confident that lots of people want. I want to help give it to them.\n\nI bet this thing gets used for like 2 days, and that will be that. It's not decentralized, which is hilarious.\n\n&gt; Edit: And I didn't even mention the fact that OpenBazaar allows for a free market in moderation using 2-of-3 multisig with trusted third parties holding the third key. Those third parties are selected on a marketplace and can set their own terms and their own fees, instead of being forced to rely on the dispute resolution services of whatever platform you're using (or Shopify, which doesn't even offer them at all).\n\nThis isn't needed in Shopify or Amazon because, as you pointed out, a majority of users use credit cards which perform this function already. So you're wrong. They do provide them. You are nothing but an incompetent boob who has never done anything in the e-commerce space. Based on your rantings, and misgivings about the current state of online retail, I can say with certainty that you have never spent any time actually working in the space. You are incomprehensibly ignorant about it, which makes you a terrible candidate to build anything having to do with it. But that's none of my never mind. Just an observation that I know is correct without even having to look at your work history. The arrogance flows through you, and it is showering down on the masses of actual e-commerce experts and online marketers who are revelling in its stupid smell. :) I wish you luck in the project, but I hope you come back here and check off each of the different ways I have told you it will fail as soon as you become a bit disillusioned with the project's shortcomings.", "id": "cx0iu4c", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": "1447554509", "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3stcgc", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": -1, "ups": -1, "author": "junseth", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1449805881, "parent_id": "t1_cx0b63q"}

{"body": "Well if you want feedback...\n\nThe site is a bit rough. It's obviously a stock Shopify build, which is fine but you should clean it up a bit. Your [logo]---LINK--- on the front page doesn't read very well. You could probably just move the image a bit to fix that. The search option should be at the top, not the bottom. The about us link doesn't need to be in the footer. You can also lose that horizontal line at the top of the footer to make it smaller and cleaner looking. \n\nThe product listing for the 3 pack looks weird. It's not spaced right *RIP-M 3 - Pack* -- **$ 80** looks pretty nasty. Should be something like *RIP-M 3-Pack* -- **$80** or *RIP-M 3 Pack* --**$80** or maybe without the -- before the $ altogether. It's already a different typeface so the extra long dash seems unnecessary. \n\nAs for the actual product, it looks really rough for a $30 piece of plastic. Very clearly has not been deburred and in the closeups the lines don't even appear straight. That's some shitty machining for the hi-res closeup product photo. The photos are all framed well but some are out of focus, and need to be redone. The attention to detail generally seems to be lacking. \n\nFurthermore I'm not convinced the product is actually useful. If I'm gonna drop 30+S&amp;H for a backpack insert I'm just gonna custom cut foam inserts. \n\nAnyway, good luck in your business endeavors. \n\nEdit: One more thing, what is the name of the product supposed to mean? Is it a medium sized RIP panel? Is there going to be a RIP-S and a RIP-L? Does it have anything to do with RIP ammo? Is it attempting to RIP-off Pelican Case's branding? \n\nEdit 2: You're totally gonna get sued by [Pelican Products Inc.]---LINK--- Even your logos look alike.

{"id": "cx4dsbd", "body": "&gt;\"The amount of energy necessary to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.\"\n- Alberto Brandolini\n****\n\nI just listened through from minute 9 to around minute 18. I've listed the criticisms below. I have bolded items that seem worth discussing. I address these at the end. I have strikethroughed items that are just insults and baseless accusations (I left most off the list). I have italicised items that are essentially meaningless because they are baseless - lacking explanation or evidence. At the bottom of the list I quote a standard definition of trolling for the reader to compare and draw a conclusion.\n\n\n* ~~OpenBazaar is stupid~~\n* **Bitcoin is \"uncensorable\", but Openbazaar is only \"uncensored\"**\n* **If someone shuts down your Bitcoin \"relay node\", you havent been censored because your coins remain accessible. If someone shuts down your OpenBazaar \"relay node\" then your store goes offline.**\n* *OpenBazaar is not a Bitcoin project.*\n* ~~OpenBazaar developers have misrepresented shopify fees - \"straight up lying\" - because they stated Shopify fees are 2.9% + 50c, but did not also state that purchases in bitcoin on shopify do not incur the same fees.~~\n* ~~OpenBazaar developers are incompetent.~~\n* **Although OpenBazaar may remove middlemen, they only do so in such a way that the value added by the middlemen is lost with no significant advantage gained.**\n* *OpenBazaar will fail because too few of the podcast's listeners have purchased items from Shopify using Bitcoin*\n* ~~Open bazaar developers have a lack of cognizance of issues.~~\n* ~~*Openbazaar developers have lied that sellers on the platform will not need to advertise because customers will magically find them.*~~\n* **OpenBazaar will fail because it competes with Amazon and ~every customer will use Amazon instead of OpenBazaar.**\n* **OpenBazaar will fail because customers will need search functions to find sellers and products and this means that OpenBazaar will compete with Google and ~every customer will use Google and therefore not OpenBazaar.**\n* *OpenBazaar is 5 years away from basic functionality including basic functions that Sendcart has.*\n* *OpenBazaar provides no added value over Wordpress, Shopify, etc*\n* ~~Sam Patterson's article on Decentralised article is the worst article ever and terrible~~\n* **Drop Zone does what OpenBazaar claims to do.**\n* **OpenBazaar developers avoid answering questions by saying they have already answered questions.**\n\n\n**Descriptives**\n\nType of Comment | Number | Proportion (%)\n---|---|----\nPoints Worth Rebutting | 7 | 41%\nInsults | 6 | 35%\nBaseless Claims | 4 | 24%\nTotal Insults/Baseless Claims | 10 | 59%\n\n*Note. Most insults and accusation were left out of this list. The true number is substantially higher.*\n\n**Characteristics of a Troll via [Rationalwiki]---LINK---\n\nA troll usually has little or no interest in contributing to the development of the site in question and is interested in some or all of the following:\n\n * Deliberately angering people.\n * Breaking the normal flow of debate/discussion.\n * Disrupting the smooth operation of the site.\n * Deliberately being annoying for the sake of being obnoxious. For instance, using abusive names to refer to all the members on the site.\n * Pretending to be profoundly ignorant or stupid, gleaning some weird sense of having \"won\" when other users subsequently come to believe this.\n * Making itself the main topic of interest or discussion.[2]\n\n**Bolded Items**\n\nThe 7 items bolded above are addressed. Note that apart from the 2 items regarding censorship, each criticism applies equally well to Drop Zone which the podcasters claim to be the exemplar decentralised marketplace. And I'll argue that even those 2 apply almost equally well to Drop Zone.\n\n**1-2/7. Bitcoin is \"uncensorable\", but OpenBazaar is only \"uncensored\"**\n\nThe podcasters' root concern appears to be a peculiar definition of censorability as opposed to censoredness. In broad terms, they appear to draw a distinction between Bitcoin and OpenBazaar by saying that Bitcoin cannot be censored, but OpenBazaar would only remain \"uncensored\" in the absence of an active effort by government to censor it. Comparison is drawn with Drop Zone. I suspect because Dropzone stores its listings on the Bitcoin blockchain. \n\nThe podcasters describe Bittorrent as uncensored, but censorable. So, it is clear that when they describe OpenBazaar as not censorship-resistant, what they mean is it is possible to censor, just as Bittorrent is.\n\nIt seems that a reasonable person would describe both Bittorrent and OpenBazaar as censorship-resistant. If the podcasters find this unacceptable, they might consider suing companies who describe their watches as waterproof.\n\nAfter all, nothing is absolutely, verifiably uncensorable. Just as there are no free lunches and nothing travels faster than the speed of light. \n\nAnd, lastly, a Drop Zone listing is as censorship-resistant as its seller. And sellers are as resistant as their anonymity. A Drop Zone seller who has lost their anonymity is no more resistant than an OpenBazaar seller - and now has a permanent record of their activities in the blockchain.\n\n**3/7. Although OpenBazaar may remove middlemen, they only do so in such a way that the value added by the middlemen is lost with no significant advantage gained.**\n\nThe essential services provided by ecommerce platforms are:\n\n\n\nService | Traditional | OpenBazaar\n---|---|----\nMarketing | Central, VC-funded | Word of Mouth or Aggregate of Independent Sellers\nNetwork Effect | Result of Marketing | Result of Open Source Standardisation\nEscrow | Central Database | Automated Bitcoin\nDispute Resolution | Central Staff | Open Market\nHosting | Central Server | Self or Open Market\nSearch | Central or Google | P2P, Open Market, or Google\nSupport | Staff or Site Forum | Open Source Community or Open Market\nRegulatory Compliance | Jurisdictional | Self or Hosted/Jurisdictional\nPayment Processing | Credit Cards (or Bitcoin processor) | Bitcoin\n\n**4/7. OpenBazaar will fail because it competes with Amazon and ~every customer will use Amazon instead of OpenBazaar.**\n\nThis claim is easily addressed. 1) an open source protocol doesn't *fail* in the same sense that a business can. As long as n &gt;= 2 peers are connected, it's working. 2) If we define success as obtaining a market niche, then let's say we need 1,000,000 users. That's 1.42e-4 of the world's current population to have a particular set of preferences such that OpenBazaar meets their needs as well as or better than other services. \n\nNext, let's consider the fact that of the 7 billion people alive today, [2 billion do not have bank accounts and 40% of them live in China, India, and Indonesia.]---LINK---\n\nSuddenly, success looks like a trickle of the world's ocean of trade.\n\n**5/7. OpenBazaar will fail because customers will need search functions to find sellers and products and this means that OpenBazaar will compete with Google and ~every customer will use Google and therefore not OpenBazaar.**\n\nOpenBazaar sellers will be searchable in much the same as torrents are searchable. There will be p2p search and standard website listings (e.g. piratebay or rather [BazaarBay]---LINK--- And then, as with torrents, many people will probably find sellers just by googling what they're looking for. \n\n**6/7. Drop Zone does what OpenBazaar claims to do.**\n\nWell then, what do OpenBazaar and Dropzone claim to be?\n\nDropzone is a solution to the problem of restricted sales in censored markets. [From the [whitepaper]---LINK---\n\nOpenBazaar is an open source project to create a decentralized network for peer to peer commerce online\u2014using Bitcoin\u2014that has no fees and no restrictions. [[Openbazaar blog: What is Open Bazaar?]---LINK---\n\nDropzone claims to enable trade of restricted goods under censorship by nation-states. OpenBazaar claims to create a network that does not charge fees or restrict access or use.\n\nA subtle difference maybe, but it's written on their labels.\n\n**7/7. OpenBazaar developers avoid answering questions by saying they have already answered questions.**\n\n[Here are OpenBazaar developers directly addressing criticisms in the comments of the Soundcloud linked.]---LINK---\n\nYou can scroll through /u/junseth's Reddit, [Soundcloud]---LINK---, and [Twitter]---LINK--- to find that he hardly, if ever, mentions OpenBazaar without a developer appearing to politely and pleasantly answer criticism. In fact, the developers appear remarkably responsive to community discussion in general.\n\nAlso note that this comment thread began with my asking /u/junseth, \n\n&gt;\"In which ways is openbazaar vulnerable to censorship? And why do these vulnerabilities trouble you?\"\n\nto which I received no reply.\n\n**High Score**\n\nPoints Worth Rebutting | 7 | 41%\n---|---|----\nPoints Correct and Not Already Addressed  | 0 | 0%\n", "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": "1447843260", "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3t7j7g", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 10, "retrieved_on": 1449872600, "author": "inviolinable", "edited": false, "ups": 10, "parent_id": "t1_cx3z58x"}

I will respond to the \"baseless\" and insulting accusations, which were also discussed at length on the show.\n\n&gt;OpenBazaar is stupid\n\nIf I'm right about the other stuff, it is stupid. It provides no efficiencies over incumbent systems.\n\n&gt; OpenBazaar developers have misrepresented shopify fees - \"straight up lying\" - because they stated Shopify fees are 2.9% + 50c, but did not also state that purchases in bitcoin on shopify do not incur the same fees.\n\nThis is 100% true. It is a claim made by OB developers again and again. And it's false because it doesn't apply to Bitcoin payments on any platform. So it is an articulation of the limitation of the OB platform which is that you cannot use credit cards.\n\n&gt; Open bazaar developers have a lack of cognizance of issues.\n\nThey do. As I just articulated in the previous response. They are not aware of how commerce works online.\n\n&gt; Openbazaar developers have lied that sellers on the platform will not need to advertise because customers will magically find them.\n\nI don't know if it's a lie, but if it's not a lie, it's embarrassing. You said that people would discover OB stores through word of mouth. Hilarious! That's how the internet worked (Webrings) back before... the internet had users. This is just an acknowledgement by the team that they do not think anyone will use the platform.\n\n&gt; OpenBazaar developers are incompetent.\n\nI would stand by that. Good developers, incompetent problem solvers.\n\n\n\n&gt; OpenBazaar is 5 years away from basic functionality including basic functions that Sendcart[sic] has. (should be Zencart, you not knowing that probably means you don't know much about e-commerce)\n\nThis was said in the OB slack. Which I said in the podcast. :)\n\n&gt; OpenBazaar provides no added value over Wordpress, Shopify, etc\n\nThis isn't baseless. this is based on the other points. And it's Wordpress with WooCommerce plugged in. Again, a pretty good indication you are not familiar with e-commerce.\n\n&gt; OpenBazaar will fail because too few of the podcast's listeners have purchased items from Shopify using Bitcoin\n\nThat was not the claim. The claim was that you can see how useful OB is by asking how often users are going to use Bitcoin to purchase. There aren't many. And you can use Shopify/Woocomerce+Wordpress to accomplish this as well. OB's claim is that on Shopify you have to go through a gateway such as Coinbase or Bitpay so you can't decide your own personal BTC wallet. So WP+WC allows that.\n\n&gt; OpenBazaar is not a Bitcoin project.\n\nIt is if Shopify is. But the truth is that OB could have been built 20 years ago and offers nothing new.

{"body": "It seems no one has directly answered your question yet, so I'll take a stab at it. They've mostly just given you out of the box options like squarespace, Wix, and Shopify. I own a digital marketing consulting company. We do basically anything a company can do online (websites, SEO, SEM, marketing campaigns, strategy, social media, etc). I also have a few small startups on the side I've been working on. I'll give my answer to you from that perspective (meaning, I'm the one investing my money to make this happen, not selling a service to a client). \n\nFirst, if you go with something like Wix or Shopify, you're getting an out of the box solution with not much power behind it. Later, when you're a much bigger company, you will have to redo this. \n\nI don't agree with just having a Facebook page. It's \"pay to play\" now with Facebook and gets very expensive. If you don't have a home base (website) to direct all of your traffic to, you are likely not going to keep the customer's interest. Also, Google won't find you as appealing with just a Facebook page. My suggestion would vary depending on the target market, but instagram has been very successful for a lot of my clients. \n\nMy suggestion is to create a website with Wordpress. There are a zillion and one plug ins (some free, some for a small fee) that can literally do whatever you want to do. Say you want to be an ecommerce site now, but want to host events later- all you do is add a plugin that adds an event hosting capability. Toggle a few settings, and you're up and running. It makes it super easy to be flexible and have all the widgets you desire. \n\nWordpress also has the most effective SEO capabilities, in my opinion. This is aside from custom programming platforms that major companies use. You're able to blog, put up whatever information you'd like about the company, and use whatever plug ins as modules to reach your goals. You can integrate MailChimp or any other newsletter software you'd like, and it's all very plug and play. \n\nWith Shopify and Wix, you're very limited on what you can do. I know this from experience with two of the start ups I worked on for the past year or so. We wanted to blog to increase our SEO and the blogging features with Shopify are terrible. We were unable to migrate any information from Wix or Shopify, so we basically had to start over designing something entirely new with Wordpress. \n\nCost-wise... if you set it up yourself, it's your time incurred, plus hosting fees, etc. Typically it's about $100/yr to host a website (that's general - depending on who you go with). \n\nIf you hire someone to do it, there are MANY great developers for Wordpress that will do it from $1500 up. I know quite a few as I use them as contractors. I usually charge around $5-7K for a simple site as I consult on strategy, copy for the site, photos, user experience, then I project manage the contractor that does the programming. \n\nI hope this helps. If you would like to talk about your goals and how to get started, I'm happy to help. If you would like for me to help you make it happen, great! If not, I can still help point you in the right direction - we would just need to discuss the particulars that I don't currently have from your post here. \n\nGood luck, OP!!

The one I can't remember was ok, but was for a fully custom store built in straight html, and was very hands on, and only did Paypal IIRC. Not very flexible or extendable, but it worked great for where it was. \n\nMiva was for a store with 10,000+ products and worked well enough. It was expensive, plugins and modules required for many things that should have been built in. They bought out my old host years ago, and I hated it afterwards. Support went downhill. Monthly price went way up, they dicked me on 2 Megs of space (yes, Megs) every month. Now they've introduced a new, more expensive pricing structure that depends on how much you make. I am tired of being milked by them, and looking for a new cart. That said, the backend and framework is vastly improved since 200whenever, but I'm not happy about the variable pricing, which leads me to Shopify. \n\nI use Shopify on my site at [twigcase.com]---LINK--- - we make and sell unique paper and bamboo iPhone cases - and I love it. I've used Shopify since 2011, and they have rocked with uptime, constant improvements, and great support. They've even contacted me about feature requests and **took my advice**. There's a ton of add ons, and they have added to the features steadily so that less are needed. Changes are easy, the syntax is reasonable, and not having to deal with the server backend stuff or patching security jazz is great. The import/export has gotten tons better, the speed is far above my user experience with squarespace, and i don't pay for sudden huge surges in traffic that would have me paying out to Miva, or having my site shutdown by my other host - which would have happened about 4 times this year, and probably 2 more times coming up. Their forums are great. \n\nI have roughly 150 skus there, and don't have experience with more on Shopify so I've been weighing my options there with the other store - some things have gotten a little too paginated in the Shopify admin and I could see it becoming frustrating managing 10,000 some items. They make minor or medium changes to UI fairly frequently, and don't have a change log, so you may need to adjust your workflow occasionally. They've been chasing new users a bit, and have been making things easier to do, but a few things are getting hidden or clunky.  I am concerned that they went public recently, and my experience has been that companies that go public, go slowly bad, but so far so good. I am being boiled sufficiently slowly. :)\n\nApart from that, I love Shopify. They have allowed me to concentrate on my product and not about managing the store.

{"body": "Hi !\nIt doesn't matter where you live to sell your products internationally unless your native country laws start bothering you. It is as simple as setting up an online store with Shopify and accepting payments worldwide . This can be hugely profitable if you manufacture the product.\nWell , it is also profitable if your are drop shipping ( selling other's manufactured products for an improved price) . But i see that you dont have any specific niche to start with and you are ready to export anything in demand . For caution i would suggest you to do a thorough market research and start with a few products. But i personally suggest not to go with any food items as there would be a lot of problems and risk involved in importing or exporting (should have a better network). Any technology products or clothing is encouraged. This part is of my advice.\n\nAs you mentioned in OP that you wanted to ship every type of product that you can legally ship , you should have a large database .

{"id": "cx6z3hg", "body": "Moved to Toronto about 3 years ago and I'm fairly involved in the ruby scene as I run a monthly hack night and workshop through the local ruby user group.\n\nAs far as jobs go, you aren't going to become amazingly rich in Toronto, but the pay in Toronto is generally the best in Canada (Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver, and Kitchener-Waterloo being the contenders). If you're out of those cities then the pickings are a lot slimmer.\n\nRealize that the Canadian dollar is weak right now (and has been historically weak) with $100 CAD being worth $75 USD. That said, even when the dollar was near parity, your expenses generally do not go up like housing, electricity and food unless you exclusively buy big-ticket items. \n\nFor a junior dev out of school, they can probably expect to be paid between $50-80k CAD. Intermediate between $80-100. Senior devs $100+, probably maxing out around $170k CAD and the average probably being in the $120k range. That said, it varies widely. Amazon, for example, is here with a SW II posting that pays $150k. There are other notable big tech companies in and around Toronto that pay pretty well and do interesting work -- PagerDuty, FreshBooks, Amazon, Google, Shopify, Microsoft (could be wrong about that one).\n\nLike most cities, getting a job with no experience (fresh out of school) is somewhat difficult, but for someone with experience you can trip and fall into a job. It's a seller's market out there for people who are selling their services.\n\nOne **huge** advantage of living and working here is that your healthcare costs are covered -- that means no stressing out about co-pays to see doctors or having to negotiate with hospital on their bills or out of network doctors, etc.. That also means that your healthcare isn't tied to your employer, which is great for mobility and not having that loom over your head if your job really sucks. Dental isn't included in this, though. Companies here will generally have extended medical (massages, etc.), dental and vision insurance.\n\nThe startup scene is very vibrant here, if you're into that or you want to get your foot in the door.\n\nThe city itself is great -- you have great access to dining, entertainment, concerts, operas, etc. anything you could want. Meetup.com is a big thing here, so you can end up making a lot of friends quickly. The city has a very diverse population with a lot of history and culture. People are very friendly, in general.\n\nTransit wise, it's not spectacular, but it is pretty OK to good. We have a few subways and a monorail-type system further away from downtown. There's an extensive streetcar (trams) network that criss-crosses the city and of course busses. There is also inter-city commuter trains that run (GO Trains), so you can live in a different city and commute to downtown Toronto every day if you actually want to own a house (housing prices within Toronto exceed a $1 million for a detached house), otherwise renting is quite a bit more reasonable or buying a condo downtown.\n\nWeather wise, it generally doesn't snow until after Christmas, but it's cool during September to December. The winters aren't bitingly cold, but you will need a winter jacket. The summers are nice and hot -- some call it 'patio season' because people will go sit on a restaurant's patio with their beverage of choice and hang out with their friends.\n\nYou're also within a day's car trip of NYC, Ottawa, Montreal, Buffalo, Philadelphia, Columbus, DC, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit, Niagara Falls, etc., so you can visit on the cheap those destinations. If you're into camping/boating, going a few hours north there are beautiful national forests and of course upstate New York is beautiful having went on a distillery tour last fall.\n\n*Warning... shameless plug ahead*.

I found a $0 workaround, but it's something I'm surprised wasn't there.\n\nIf you haven't used Shopify before this may not be clear, but basically I REALLY wish you could have multiple layers of collections (e.g. sub-collections). I've read complaints dating back 5 years in their forums (**by the way, reading their forums are a great way to see what people don't like, just make sure that if there's been no update for over 8 months you check that it's been corrected**). \n\nThe best example of sub collections being an issue is with clothing. Let's say you want:\n\n* A collection for men's and a collection for women's\n* Collections within each for different seasons\n* Collections within each of those for each type of clothing (pants, jackets, socks, etc.)\n\nYou can't do it. I have a similar issue on mine, but luckily I only have 3 layers needed: broad category 1 and 2, collections within each broad category, products within each collection (and obviously variants within each product). My workaround was to create a separate page that just displayed all of the collections I wanted in broad category 1 and 2 (there was support to help with this). I then created menu links and images on my main page that linked to this page. Adding another layer I think would have been complicated though.\n\nTo elaborate on the themes: I think it's really getting better all the time. The new theme editor makes it so much simpler to change things and the themes that do exist are really well-designed to suit mobile, etc. Vs. other ecommerce platforms Shopify appears to have more people supporting it, which means the number of apps, themes, etc. is growing faster than anywhere else.\n\nMore than any software I've ever used, I love their updates. Virtually every update has left me in a better position than before. Other softwares (for anything, e.g. Microsoft) I've found myself spending a shitload of time re-learning something.

All this that you post sounds great, but as I understand essentially what you are offering is taking care of the tech piece, perhaps a bit of marketing, sales etc and other responsibilities for equity rather than upfront cash:\n\n* Parting with equity for a company founder is a big decision, what you are getting is sweat equity or for larger stake co-founder status but if you are working on other clients/business at the same time, it will be super hard for the person running the business and you to align expectations. 80 hours is a lot of work, but in business built for scale and growth like a tech startup every day is new shit coming up and you need to adapt so essential to have your core team fully there, not working on other projects which you might have to do. If you go full time then you are essentially becoming part of the biz and not doing the thing you state above\n\n* If a start up is making cash, and the goal is growth the founders and business will essentially retain most to be re-invested and not paid as salary/ dividend to shareholders. \n\n* If you are building new categories of business, breaking new grounds getting users, building scale takes longer than you ever plan for. Hitting profitability is hard, Cost of customer Acquisition is high in online business, repeat behavior is hard. Marketing tends to eat a lot of money\n\n* For this entire online store set up/manage thing you state, why should a startup founder work with you and why not use \"Shopify\" or the ilk to set up a vanilla store, considering cost of equity this might be cheaper for the business you are partnering with\n\n* As someone else raised how do you get more clients, do you have a big network? Are you well known to get people to come to you for this? Are you looking for WOM for referrals? Have you accounted for that and time hunting for new biz might take?\n\n* What if the business never becomes profitable and there is no exit so unless it is a service business where in you pull in some cash a tech product focused business could go down and your equity become worthless.

{"body": "Hello, thank you for taking the time to comment,\n\nI'll try and answer as if your bullet points were questions to help make my reply easier to read.\n\n- You're right, it is going to take a lot of work and time to grow this into any sort of successful business, or even a profitable one, at that. I'm not expecting for one minute that each start-up is going to be a home run. But, going on the amount of work I'm anticipating, I'm confident that I can manage sharing my time between the sites well enough. From my savings and other revenue streams (and little expenses and outgoings as I've cut everything right back), I'm still okay if I don't earn a penny from any of the sites during the first year. That's the worst-case scenario, and even then, I'll have gained invaluable experience and skills. On the flip-side, I just need one of the sites to take off and become successful over that 12 month period.\n\n- I've agreed already with my current clients that if the business does start making money initially, then I will take a small percentage of this each month. This is not ideal for all businesses, but if I'm able to work to create a profitable start-up almost immediately for my client when otherwise it wouldn't have been possible for them, then that's something they'll be happy with.\n\n- Initially, I won't be going into any new markets or begin working with any business if I expect it will take 18+ months to see any sort of return.\n\n- Great question about why won't or shouldn't they use Shopify? Shopify's a great and relatively simple-to-use tool, but it's still super easy to make a site look awful on there. And what about making the images look great, and writing strong sales copy? And getting that website ranked on Google, and having a strong branding and marketing strategy? How about little things like having logos and Facebook cover images created, and new graphics made to match topical events and public holidays? These are some of the things that I bring to the table.\n\n- Regarding getting new clients, this is actually one card that I'm keeping up my sleeve, and probably the main reason why I've decided to launch this business (*evil laugh*). Just kidding about the evil laugh, but the rest is still true!\n\n- If none of the businesses take off and make money then at least I've followed my dream, I'll still be 26 and I'll take my experience and new-found knowledge and perhaps start something in a market with more of a proven track record!\n\nThank you.\n", "id": "cx87362", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": "1448131953", "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3tp57y", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "Cloudformex", "edited": 1448132159, "retrieved_on": 1449938479, "parent_id": "t1_cx8613z"}

{"body": "Your comparison is so one sided it is embarrassing.\n\n**The average eCommerce store:**\n&gt;Shopify / Magento / Bigcommerce platform (includes: fees, restrictions, privacy concerns, customer identity exposed, transactions exposed, revenues exposed)\n\nHow do the open source web stores include fees?  What restrictions do they have that OB doesn't? What privacy concerns?  Why would they be more susceptible to customer identities being exposed?  Or transactions or revenue?  They wouldn't.  Literally every point here doesn't apply to those so it's dishonest to include them and I'm guessing you know this.\n\n&gt;Payment processing via Stripe Integration / Braintree Integration (includes: fees, restrictions, privacy concerns, customer identity exposed, transactions exposed, revenues exposed)\n\nOr straight though bitcoin if you want.  So the only difference here is that you have access to customers that don't use bitcoin.  Which is almost all of them.  Again just throwing 'privacy concerns, customer identity exposed, transactions exposed, revenues exposed' into every point to make them look longer doesn't make them any more correct.\n\n&gt;Must have a bank account (includes: fees, restrictions, privacy concerns, customer identity exposed, transactions exposed, revenues exposed)\n\nNot true.  There is nothing stopping you from using just bitcoin.  No one does it because no one that tries makes money.\n\n&gt;Need to reach your entire audience? Use something like Mail Chimp or Constant contact (includes: fees; pay more as your subscriber count increases, restrictions, privacy concerns, customer identity exposed)\n\nOr setup an RSS feed.  Oh look it's your standard space fillers again.\n\n&gt; Need to chat live with your customers? Install something like Olark (includes: fees, restrictions, privacy concerns, customer identity exposed)\n\n---LINK--- there are a lot of free and easy to setup solutions.  Pretty sure all the major OS ecommerce platforms have free plugins for this too.\n\n&gt;No bank account or credit card? Sorry, go open an account first.\n\nYou already posted this.\n\n&gt;Under 18? Sorry, come back in a few years.\n\nThis isn't true.  Lots of people under 18 run online stores and again there is nothing stopping you from using just bitcoin except a desire to have customers.\n\n&gt;Target audience unbanked? Sorry, can't serve them.\n\nSee above.  Not that the unbanked is a great target market for an online store.\n\n&gt;Setup difficulty: Advanced (some technical advice/support likely needed to piece everything together)\n\nBullshit.  Just about every VPS or shared hosting account in the past 15 years has come with a one click way to install an ecommerce platform.  These are mature products.  If you want to fully customize it then it can be complex but that isn't needed for almost all use cases.\n\n&gt;Cost: $50+ month for beginner stores plus recurring transaction fees\n\nAgain bullshit.  I can install a store on a $5/month droplet no problem.  I could actually probably install a dozen of them on it.\n\n&gt;Audience: Banked adults\n\nEveryone with a web browser\n\n&gt;Attract new customers: Paid search\n\nOr SEO\n\n&amp;amp;nbsp;\n&amp;amp;nbsp;\n\nVS \n\n&amp;amp;nbsp;\n&amp;amp;nbsp;\n\n**The standard OpenBazaar store:**\n\n&gt;eCommerce abilities built in for free\n\nYou would hope so since it is ecommerce software.  But OS ecommerce platforms have this too.  \n\n&gt;Payment processing built in for free\n\nSee above about bitcoin only being possible just stupid.\n\n&gt;Banking capabilities (wallet) built in for free (eventually)\n\nSo bitcoin only and restricted userbase? got it.\n\n&gt;Reach your entire audience built in for free (reach unlimited followers, no fees)\n\nSee above.  Also the belief that anyone on this platform will have enough customers to go over mailchimps free threshold is a joke.\n\n&gt;Live encrypted chat built in for free\n\nSee above.  This isn't unique.\n\n&gt; No credit card or bank? Perfect\n\nNo customers\n\n&gt;Under 18? Welcome\n\nSame as above\n\n&gt;Target audience unbanked? Perfect\n\nTargeting people who can't or won't get a bank account online.  Sounds like a sound business proposition.  You realize these people can't easily get coins either right?  Because they are unbanked they are stuck with ATMs/LBC all charging them a premium for coins.  They might as well just shop local.\n\n&gt;Setup difficulty: Easy  \n&gt;Setup time: 60 seconds  \n&gt;Cost: Free  \n\nUnless you don't want to run it from your home connection.\n\n&gt;Privacy strength: Medium (conversations encrypted, chat messages encrypted, customer identity not exposed, revenues are private)  \n\nssl exists for websites too making all of these the same for someone hosting a web shop.\n\n&gt;Audience: Anyone in the world\n\nAnyone in the world with bitcoin(so ~1m people) who are willing to spend it(so probably ~100k actually) who are willing to install OB to shop(probably &lt;20k).  But ya anyone!\n\n&gt;Attract new customers: from the built in marketplace and through the social features integrated into the application\n\nSo lets say it becomes popular and a bunch of merchants sign up.  How do you ensure your products are seen in the search?\n\n\n&gt;OpenBazaar wont be as feature rich as something like Magento right out of the gate, but the foundation is much better and the core feature offering should catch up over time.\n\nHow is the foundation better?

I would day the minimum trial is 30 days.  Ideally 45.\n\nThe biggest question I have is how does it integrate into my site.  Most smaller eCommerce sites don't have a developer on staff.  Instalation has to be dead simple.  I would suggest writing a Wordpress/Woo Commerce, or Drupal Commerce, or Shopify, or Magento plugin and make installing your software foolproof.\n\nWhat does your software do.  Are you selling a service where you do the custom optimization on their site or is this a completely automated system.\n\nOn your pricing page, what are events and reactions.  Is that a single page view?  If I have a customer browsing my selection or 100 purses and they just keep hitting next and view all 100 is that 100 events or reactions?  Also why are you limiting the number of users?  This feels like a false limit to me.  Why not make it the same for everyone?\n\nDoes this optimization have an interface outside of my eCommerce storefront platform?  If so why?  Most eCommerce sites already have to interact with enough different systems. e.g shipping software, inventory software, accounting software, payment gateway software.  If at all possible integrate the setup and control interface with the shopping cart system that is being used.\n\nI need more details.  I can't buy something when I don't know what it really does and how it works.  Your competitors will tell me so I am not likely to go to the extra work of filling out a contact form and asking for clarification. \n\nI think what you are offering is a need in the eCommerce industry, but is the way you are going about it filling the need?  I think the reason there is a need is that several shopping cart systems don't have tools built in to do what you are doing.  I think that the way to get a customer is find a real site with a real need and offer to integrate this system for them on a commission basis.  They only pay if it works.

{"body": "Re: Shopify\nI was originally going to roll my own website, my idea was a single landing page similar to what is there at the moment. I found myself spending waay too long struggling with the code to get it up and running. Shopify was an easy way to start collecting orders and even came with an easy to use payment gateway, so I ran with it. I did have to wrangle shopify alittle bit to make it a one page store though. So from the outset I was aiming to be a single item shop. \n\nRe: generic product. Yeah, that was the idea.

{"id": "cxb4rnx", "body": "In answer to your first question:\n\nThere are literally thousands of eCommerce providers. I've personally used quite a few, but have found the following 2 to work in most business case scenarios.\n\n1. Use Shopify if you're looking for an easy-to-use 'works out of box' solution. In my experience, Shopify is unparalleled in its super easy learning curve and pre-built themes. However it can become quite expensive if you plan to sell a lot (as they take a fee per sale). I've used Shopify for a simple eCommerce site in which the product was the sole content. I would definitely use it again.\n\n2. WooCommerce + Wordpress is a more complex solution which allows you to tap into the ever growing, open source Wordpress platform. WooCommerce is clunkier than Shopify, and is a step-up in terms of learning curve. With that being said, WooCommerce doesn't charge any transaction fees (apart from normal Payment Processor fees), has 1 click install on most hosting sites and is much better suited if you plan on ever selling over $5k in revenue per month. I used WooCommerce + Wordpress for an eCommerce site which did large volumes, sold expensive products and was supplemented by blog posts, content, videos etc. I would definitely use it again.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nShopify is pretty much the easiest to use, but charges a monthly fee + transaction fee\nWooCommerce is a more complex option and you only pay for any paid plugins or themes you use + website hosting (much cheaper in comparison to Shopify).\n\nThere are a bunch of eCommerce platforms which you could use, I'd suggest signing up for some trial plans to get a feel for the software and what you find most comfortable to use.\n\n**Now to domains...**\n\nTraditionally domain names like .com, .co.uk, .net, .org all referred to specific types of businesses or organisations (categorised by location, type, business structure etc), however now with a new bunch of TLDs (top level domains), businesses have more freedom in naming their start-up.\n\nFor example .io refers to the computing terms \"input / output\" and is commonly adopted by tech startups. .xxx would refer to a site within the sex niche etc.\n\nWhen starting a business, my advice would be to opt for a .com and/or traditional location domain for your intended country of business (for example .com.au for a business in Australia, or .co.uk for a business in the UK). If you're feeling adventurous and are 100% sure your business can be branded with one of the newer domains - go for it.\n", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": "1448345349", "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3u1dea", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1449989024, "author": "melbournewank", "edited": 1448345632, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_3u1dea"}
{"body": "You're right the aesthetics of the Shade wallet can be improved and they will be, that's something we can do without having to \"fork\" the network so it can easily be added after the official release or in incremental updates for user experience improvements. The textfile setup you had to go through is only because of the current beta status. Following the mainnet release we'll have a hosted service for interacting with the SYS decentralized marketplace that will be much prettier along the lines of OpenBazaar. Shortly after that we'll have plugins to integrate with platforms like Shopify, Opencart, etc to mirror your items to the SYS marketplace from those mainstream platforms. \n\nSYS items can support all types of information as you'll see in Blockmarket. The reference wallet GUI is intended to be simpler- but still fully functional. If you're looking for something like a shipping cost calculation based on actual customer location and then adding that shipping cost to the price at checkout that's something that would be done in the Blockmarket (or other service) layer. If you have fixed shipping for all items that can be done directly when creating the offer. \n\nUsing BTC on the SYS marketplace is based on price pegging- so you can sell your item for 1BTC and what will happen is when a user purchases that item you will receive the equivalent of 1BTC in SYS based on SYS/BTC conversion rates at the time of purchase. This same pattern applies for all available currencies, which we will expand.\n\nWhile OB dress is currently prettier, SYS dress will get there. We have more services to offer merchants and more flexibility for other currencies through our price pegging and encryption features (not to mention features in beta4 that have yet to be announced). I also think we leave more room for buyer discovery by not having to \"join\" various markets to find items. Digital certificates provide an easy way to automatically link the delivery of digital goods with an offer and aliases are a much friendlier addressing mechanism than standard BTC or SYS addresses based on public keys. \n\nThese are just a few of the features we've added to differentiate our offering from the competition.

{"id": "cxb9vgq", "body": "I worked on 3 Shopify stores so far, and here are my major dislikes:\n\n-The Apps. One of the best &amp; worst parts of Shopify. There are some really good apps, and then there are some apps that are slow and bad. Some seem to be overcharging for features that should be standard in my opinion. Want a intelligent filter menu? $15 per month. The cost of some of the apps are in no logical relation to the price of shopify. The basic plan costs $29 per month, and a filter menu costs half of that. What.\n\n-Pricing. Why am I not able to input the purchase price of the my articles so I can directly see the calculation of prices and real earnings? \n\n-POS and Barcodes by Shopify are horrible. No real world use for me. First of all the Shopify POS seems to be geared towards a small retailer who sells like 10 times per hour. It lacks basic features like reciept printing on a printer other than these small restaurant-like reciepts. I want to print a nice Din-A4 reciept. I really would love to use Shopify POS in our stores, but seeing how slow it is, that really wouldn't work. \n\nThe Barcode-App is slow and complicated. It loads sooooo slow. There seems to be no way of printing a bulk-labels except exporting a CSV. WTF? Why can't I just print labels \"on the go\" when I add new products? And the labels of the recommended printer do not stick to our (textile) products. The barcode reader in the Shopify app (using the phones/ipads camera) is useless in \"real world conditions\". I also don't understand why this needs to be external Apps, these features should become native to shopify in my opinion.\n\n-Collections. Not being able to make sub(-sub-sub)-collections really make no sense to me. I don't get it. And this limitation makes it virtually impossible for some stores to switch to shopify. \n\n-Website content other than the shop or blog. It's really frustrating complicated to add some extra content to your pages. There is also a difference in how that is done with different themes. There should be atleast a basic editor with the ability to make sections without having to mess with code.\n\n-No Klarna Payment / This is a really sad story: Klarna is the largest Pay-After-Delivery service in Germany and Scandinavic countries. Shopify is not able to integreate this payment solution. Since 2 or 3 years there is a thread on the Shopify forums were they always postponed it, and always claim to work on it. This is really frustrating and extremly intransparent. I believe it's \"in development\" for atleast 1,5 years now. I understand that Shopify is focused on the North-American market, but atleast be honest. If you don't want to integrate Klarna - Fine.\n\n\nThat being said Shopify is still my favorite choice. I love the hosted experience, and not having to worry about problems of a self hosted cart like Magento or Woocommerce. I can't wait for the day when Shopify (hopefully) has matured the POS so far that I can throw our old in-house (windows NT based) software out and manage the whole warehouse in shopify.\n\nFor a small/start-up ecommerce there is no better solution in my opinion. Unless you have someone coding savvy who develops &amp; maintances a Magento installation. And these (labor + fast hosting) costs will be huge compared to the price of shopify.\n\nMy new shop, just a few days old and still in development: ---LINK---", "subreddit": "shopify", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sn78", "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": "1448364230", "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3tm0at", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "tepoka_de", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1449991495, "parent_id": "t3_3tm0at"}

{"body": "I'm going to weigh in here as well because I have spent a shit to of time in this group and other entrepreneur groups looking for feedback and ways to grow and the same things you are doing right now. My business is about to hit it's one year anniversary and I have learned so much in the last year it has been insane. \n\nFirst. I hate everything about your site. I'm not trying to be a dick but you have to understand that when someone comes to your site and it takes 2-3 minutes to figure out what you sale, then you have already missed your mark. It took me that long. The absolute first thing that you have to showcase is your product. Not text, and not a mock up. You MUST have images with people wearing your clothing. That's business 101. \n\nI can't read your tagline. I have zero idea what it says. \nYou NEED a real logo and real designs. Hire a professional designer. Your text based designs won't sale in the way they are now. You are kind of all over the place. Trust me when I say the money that you spend to pay a designer will come back 3 fold to you. \n\nLet's talk about LUDY. Ask yourself what does this really mean? I read your about and honestly I think you have missed the mark. Revamp this and put some serious thought into what it really means. If you are looking to do motivational shirts you are in a tough market, those things are everywhere. That said, this bring me full circle to what I initially said about hiring a designer. A good designer can help you narrow down what your brand truly is. I just don't get the connection with the warrior and scriptures. To me those two things do not belong together. \n\nYou should consider moving your platform to a shopify or woo commerce site unless you have mad coding skills or hire a site designer. That thing is pain to look at. Your colors and your font are bad. \n\nYou have to get more engaged on social media. You have had an IG account for 3 weeks and don't have any followers. You have to do something to create a following. Just posting shit is not going to get you anywhere. Trust me. You have to do giveaways, get your products in the hands of bloggers, social influences and everything else that you can imagine. \n\nWhat your site is missing.\nOk, there are few key things that you need on your site to protect yourself especially since you are collecting people's payment and contact info. \n\nYou MUST have a privacy notice, a terms and conditions, shipping information, size chart, and return policy. That is just for starters.  \n\nANSWER THIS QUESTION\nWhat do people that exercise have to do with your brand? You have to figure out who your target market is and you are not going to do that in a couple of weeks. \n\nI know exactly who my market is based on google analytics, facebook analytics, who actually buys my clothing, who followers me on IG and blah blah blah. \n\nI'm still super new into this game but I will tell you this much I have put in a shit ton of work and I'm seeing it pay off. \n\nI think that you need to go back to the drawing board. Start from scratch and really do this the right way and most importantly be patient and take some risks. But you have to be willing to invest especially if you want to build a brand. If you want to sell 10 shirts I can show you how to do that in 5 minutes. \n\nI think you should check out a few books that I have read over the last year that might also help you. \n\nJab,jab,jab, right hook - Gary Vaynerchuk\nMarketing a love story- Jiwa\nDisplay of Power - Daymond John\nUnlable - Marc Ecko\nLaunch a Kick Ass T-shirt Brand\n\nThose are a couple that come to mind right off the top of my head. I have read probably 10 more that I find bits and pieces that have helped me grow.\n\nThis is not easy  but if you want it you'll go get it. Feel free to hit me up I'll help you the best I can.

{"body": "I just want to add my 2 cents about Wizardpuff.ca:\n\nI should point out that I live in Mississauga, which is right beside Toronto, where they ship from. It takes a day, 2 at most, to get large parcels from there to here. \n\nI tried to order a Flowermate last Friday during the day for a friend, after the last product he ordered from them broke. They didn't replace it, since they only offer 30-day warranty (you have to pay more for warranty, which I get) They sent a 15% off coupon code to make up for it. Fair.  Tried to use the coupon, didn't work.\n\nDidn't hear back from them until Sunday, where they told me to clear my cache and it should work. It didn't work because they didn't activate it. They finally did the next day. I tried to pay for the purchase Monday BUT even tho I got the 15% off discount, they now charged me $10 for free shipping (shipping is free over $100 in Canada, my product was $125 after discount).\n\nThey replied to this error on Tuesday (another 24 hour delay in responses) by telling me to just complete the transaction, and they will refund my credit card. I asked if they were sure they could do that, as I was paying with Visa Debit. They told me they could.\n\nI placed the order and asked them to ship it out that day, as I needed it by Sat, as it was a gift. 24 hours later, on Wed, they told me they close at 5 every day (inconsistent with their email response times) so they couldn't ship it Tues, will go out end of day Wed, which was useless to me as I needed the gift by Sat, but whatever. Again, I live a bus ride away from where they ship from.\n\nOn Wed, they told me they couldn't refund my $10 in shipping costs that I paid for (free shipping), and that I would have to wait a week for their accountant to come in. I replied back mentioning that that was the reason I asked if they were able to refund me in the first place, since I used Visa Debit. I also pointed out the 24-hour wait-time responses and the unusable coupon code they gave me. They \"you have to wait a week\" response was one thing, but in conjunction with the other mishaps, I was not pleased. \n\n24 hours later I got an email saying my entire order was canceled AT MY REQUEST, and that they were sorry I was unhappy with their experience. I didn't cancel the order.\n\nI logged onto my bank account and saw that the money was taken from my account, then refunded...AND THEN TAKEN OUT AGAN!\n\nI called my bank and needless to say they will protect me, and the funds will be back in my account within 5 biz days. \n\nIn short, I wasted 4 days PLACING AN ORDER from Wizard Puff's Shopify-based website. The .ca one, not the .com one.\n\nI ordered from them before and was happy with the product I bought, but I found this experience very troublesome. I'm sure they're a fine company, but they need to iron out some kinks in running the biz. Again, this is just my experience.

I can understand the licensing strategy and by all means, if you can license something profitable for the right multiple go for it, however most people will be better off with an Internet-based business simply because of reach and low cost access to customers. In addition to reach, barrier-to-entry is insanely low - like in the hundreds of dollars using companies like Shopify, Squarespace, Etsy, or Amazon's FBA, and that isn't even considering Wordpress with cheap plugins. \n\nThis also doesn't take into account scale, which with the Internet is worldwide.

I can't think of many examples where you could buy a real world B&amp;M for $100k that's actually profitable. Think about it. Using a 3x multiple you'd essentially be buying a $33k/yr business!

Design trends will change and you'll inevitably decide you'd like to try new functionality with your eCommerce store. \n\nBig Commerce is bad in all these regards. Shopify is a big step closer. They have an API, they have the ability to extend and integrate. They have a well refined design templating system which means your designs can evolve and the functionality of your website can improve and adapt. \n\nSeriously, don't lock yourself in a hellish vault by using poor software. Shopify isn't perfect but it's much closer to it than Big Commerce.\n\nPS. There's a comment here that suggests WooCommerce and they've been downvoted, however they have a very valid point.

Buy some FB/Google Ads and drive them to different landing pages (you can use instapage) and see if you can get the Sale. \n\n**2. Use Established Framework**: For the purposes of saving A LOT of TIME, I suggest using a Selling Platform like Shopify. They have awesome UI/UX design and you can set up your online store in a couple of hours. Additionally, Shopify will allow you to sell on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterst, etc... and manage all payments with the click of a button. If your serious, I think this is a no brainer.\n&gt; This is Much, Much, Much Cheaper &amp; Faster than hiring a UX/UI Designer ($100/hr) and a Better End Result!\n\n**3. Branding**: What Differentiates your from any other store selling similar items? You have to Discover what your 'niche' is and sell to that market. Narrow your focus down substantially and zero in on a few great niche markets.

For example, if she puts in \"wine dress\" with no quotes as a keywords to target, it could be targeting whenever someone types in wine or dress.

{"body": "That week, I recall, wasn't in fact that quiet of one.  I was trying to rack my brain and remember what I was doing that week and why it seemed to be a black hole.  Now I remember!\n\nSo I was using Webydo, a drag-and-drop website designer with an interface very similar to Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator.  I was entranced by the cool and easy to use tools and signed up for it without realizing a fatal glitch in their technology for e-commerce stores.  \n\nThis glitch only became apparent when I submitted my products to be listed on Google.\n\nGoogle has product listing ads, you know, so when you google for a product specifically it comes up with a nice little icon of it, a price, and where to buy it.  It's a typical pay per click scheme, but I thought a good one to find motivated clickers.  I had tried a couple campaigns on Facebook for between $5 and $10 but it had very little effect.  \n\nActually, I'm going to take a little aside to talk about Facebook for a second.  I think by now I have discovered how to use Facebook effectively, and (in my opinion) Facebook is a good advertising medium but not as an opener.  If you use Facebook to target specifically people who are your fans to reinforce their love of your brand and you use it as a means to get your repeat clientele to reorder.  At least with this kind of product, I have not benefited at all using Facebook to advertise for new customers, but Facebook has been a fantastic tool in building greater love of our product among people who had already purchased the product before.  \n\nFor this reason my Facebook campaigns are no longer \"Location:  Maryland, Age: 45 - 65, Gender:  Female, Has a dog, likes fitness and health\".  My Facebook campaigns have become \"Has purchased products from the online store before, is a fan of the page or is a friend of a fan of the page, lives in the U.S.\".  Since our fulfillment has gone nationwide, location doesn't matter anymore.  Our first campaigns were useless.  Our current campaigns are effective.\n\nAlright, back to it!  Google Product Listings.  So I submitted the products to Google, stock photos and descriptions and all, and eagerly awaited... To receive 6 \"Product rejected\" e-mails all at once and then a \"Your account has been suspended\" e-mail.\n\n\"lolwut\" what was my first thought and then I looked at the e-mail. I was missing some things on my store to make it a legit store.  They were as follows:\n\n1.  Terms and Conditions.  Nowhere on my website did I say the terms and conditions of how my business operated.  This needed to include a bit about returns and refunds policy and blabbity bla.  Oy.\n\n2.  Contact Info.  Nowhere did I have the address where my business operated on the website, nor did I have a telephone number to be reached at.  I did have a \"contact form\" but that wasn't enough.  This wouldn't be so much of a problem.\n\n3.  I didn't have a HTTPS checkout, or a secure checkout server.  I had a sneaking suspicion this one might be a real pain in the ass.  It was.\n\nNumber one, however, ended up being a lot easier to remedy than I initially suspected.  I thought I was going to have to get a lawyer to draft up some T&amp;C but in fact my Google-fu once again saved the day when I typed in \"terms and conditions template.\"  It brought me to shopify's website which, with a few entries into a form printed out a custom terms and condition sheet for Kronch USA.  Sweet.  \n\nGood move, by the way, Shopify.  You'll see why in a second...\n\nContact Info, done.  Added, easy peezy.\n\nThird part - HTTPS sever.  Rokie dokie, give Webydo the old technical support chitty chat...  Oh?  You can't do HTTPS?  Hm.  Then I need to leave.  Oh, you won't give me a refund for my unused service?  Ok cool, I'll go post negative reviews about your company all over the place... Oh now you will give me a refund?  Cool, thanks!  I'll remove those reviews.  Alrighty, time to find a new place for my website.\n\nWhat's this Shopify place that I got the terms and conditions from anyways? (See?  Well done Shopify!)\n\nThat's when I started using Shopify.com.  Not only does it have a pretty sweet and easy to set up system for the web store, it also has a POS app for your phone which lets you take credit cards through the phone (I was using Square previously)... the part that did it for me was the inventory tracking, whether I sold product in person at expos, to retailers at wholesale, or on the internet through my web store, it keeps track of my inventory at home and makes approximations about how many days of inventory I have remaining.  This is super useful because freight from Denmark takes about a month so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nSome people tell me Shopify is too expensive and I should use WooCommerce with a Wordpress theme for better SEO optimization.  This is something I do want to look into, and I appreciate anyone's feedback if they have experience with it.\n\nBut honestly, I feel like I'm getting what I'm paying for with them.  Their customer support is really good, their templates are good, secure checkout, nice POS system, good inventory management, everything just works nicely for $65 a month it's totally cool by me.\n\nThe products got listed on Google and everything was totally cool.  And I like how the new website looks now better than the old one.  Solid.  At the time it was a huge annoyance and I was pretty pissed off about the whole thing, but hey, turned out alright!  \n\nAs a little aside, while you're in the the thick of it you will arrive at despair multiple times and feel like giving up, but just remember you reap what you sow.  If you sow enough seeds some of them will take hold and soon you'll be sitting pretty.  As long as there are signs that what you've got as a product or a service is worth buying, don't give up.\n\nI arrived at despair multiple times this week.  I questioned my existence and verily the existence of everything around me multiple times.  We hadn't gotten any orders from any of the events through the website yet.  Where were the repeat customers that would be eager to buy more?  The website was a pain in the ass, nothing was going as I had hoped it would...

{"body": "A website for logos and other stuff...this was last year when I was 15 and living in Mexico. I am/was pretty good at using programs for the edition of any type of media and overall graphic design so I decided to start something. $600 budget, set up a shop on shopify, a vimeo pro account, a dropbox business account, two years of a mexican domain name with email hosting included. I began by designing the website which in my opinion ended up looked really professional, made a sort of 'inspiring commercial' and Facebook page both which faked really well a big stable professional company (only exception was the low number of likes) and a Facebook Account which allowed me to post in \"buy/sell\" Facebook Groups which are really popular where I lived, I thought my niche was there. The shopify account included a $20 Facebook gift card for advertising expenses so I used that In several well directed campaigns. I got 70 page likes and around 300 likes for the commercial in two first days. The issue? Even though the Facebook page was growing steadily, the website's traffic was practically nonexistent; two weeks and the site only received 3 visitors who never went past the main screen. The second issue was that Facebook banned me from using the groups feature since I requested to join too many of them and they noticed I wasn't a real person but rather a business. I spent 3 more weeks trying to make it work but vacations were on the verge of ending and I had to have everything running smoothly before school began so I wouldn't lose focus on studies and other more important hobbies. I also had used up most of my budget by this point and I wasn't producing anything. I felt hopeless. I learned a lot of things, mainly, how to do and what not to do. I think it failed mainly because of my inexperience and my stubbornness of doing it by myself without my dad's help (he is a really successful and experienced businessman). I learned that finding potential clients is tough but that getting their attention is even tougher. \n  \nTl;DR: Reality slapped me in the face.

{"id": "cxhe3cj", "body": "Here are my 2 cents. (context: I'm a guy so I don't know anything about handbags but I ran an online and retail cosmetics and beauty store. I am also a web dev and Business development consultant. \n\nmy 2 cents....\n\nOne month isn't a good enough indication of the future potential of your business especially if you are passionate about it. Give it a solid 90-120+ days especially if you haven't dumped allot of cash into it. It will take time, it will take energy and lots of ups and downs, and it will cost some money. After all its a business. \n\nHowever if you do give it a solid go and are investing money into it and aren't turning a profit then cut your losses quickly and move on to the next idea unless you want to stick with it for the long haul and rebrand yourself. \n\nAs far as marketing goes here are some suggestions:\n\nYou need to engage with people in various ways..\n\nTry Hootsuite to manage all your social media campaigns. They have a free version that allows you to run 2 campaigns for free and their next tier is like 9.99 a month. \n\nIts basically one dashboard that lets you manage all your facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest, twitter, whatever else people use these days so you have consistency and the same message across all your social media and you can schedule your posts. It also lets you engage with your customers but you don't yet have any....still something to think about. \n\n---LINK---\n---LINK---\n\nget some newsletters or info out. They won't come if they don't know you are there. Give people some incentives to buy from you or to get to know you. Host some events, or go to some local meetup or fair and try to offer your products there. Find out what that would cost. \n\nYou need to be consistent in your messaging. \n\nYour facebook page I think is nicer than your Etsy store. it looks more like a company page. \n\nVisit lots of places/forums with people who might want to buy your products or who make handbags hang out. Both on handbag / fashion related sites/communities and adventure/travel/whatever places or places for designers. Share your ideas, ask questions and gugae interest in your products. Become involved answering questions and giving advice or posting so you get some reputation and can occasionally market yourself there (within their rules). \n\nMaybe where you are located its not the best place to market. In addition to what you are doing in your local area, seek out the type of people you think might like the type of products you make in specific geographic area that cater to adventure or nature. Do some data mining i.e. find out where these people are and what their email is and contact them. \n\nContact them with a simple email and a link to your store. Nothing long a sentence or 2 saying. Hi I'm so and so from TerraLura. We make awesome hand made bags for adventurous people. Xmas is coming up and maybe you might be interested in a gift idea for yourself or someone you love. Etc. \n\nAlso see out some local businesses or people who share the same ideas that you do in the same niche as you and put your business cards there, and talk to those people. Tell them what you do, and here is the most important thing - ask them if there is something you can do for them, and ask if they could carry your products or at least demo some of them or recommend your products or point you in the right direction etc.\n\nTry to also set up / book some office parties over lunch at local businesses. This would require you to bring some appetizers and will eat into your budget. You can also try the pottery barn/mary kay method of hosting parties at people's homes or your own but I don't know how viable that actually is. \n\nYou can offer some coupons or rebates or incentives for some of your products but that would require you to have pricing that covers all of that. \n\nIn the end you need to reach out to people. That is key. The idea of \"If I build it they will come\" never works. \n\nI can't really comment about your product as its not my forte and am not female, but I can tell you that as a designer you should strive over time to develop a consistent \"look\" and the better word would be \"style\". Just like an artist who starts out copying others, then over time develops his unique style that sets him apart from everyone else, so you too need to eventually develop a unique style but also one that has consistency across all product lines and offerings. Let that show through in your products so that you develop a following of people who like that particular \"style\" that you bring to the table that is unique. \n\nTell a story with your business and your products. People love to get behind an idea. Think Apple. What idea and message are you trying to convey. get people behind that message. Your bags aren't just bags they are gateways to adventure, or reminders of freedom and a traveler's spirit. See what did here? Tell a story and get people behind it.Get people behind your business because your business does more than just sells bags.  \n\nYou have a cool business name and logo (business identity). That's a plus. \n\nYour small bags are $5. Is that price enough to cover your labor costs and cost of goods sold? your marketing sosts, design costs, creation, shipping etc? I dunno so I am asking as it seems really low. Increase your prices like 4 times. People don't like cheap. Cheap = low quality. There is such a thing as perception of quality. Figure out who your target market is? Who are you selling to? Don't try to sell to everyone. If your goal is to sell to adventurous loving people set your prices comparable to what other companies, and boutique stores price their handbags, totes, wallets and stuff at. \n\nIf you want a real business, Etsy isn't enough. How serious are you about your business and what is your monthly budget? Eventually you might want to get a real store if you are serious about what you are doing. \n\nYou should set up an inline store on a .com like teralura.com or teraluraonline.com or teralurahandbags.com etc. \n\nEither your own site with a shopping cart or... \n\nUse a platform like Volusion or Shopify. \n---LINK---\n---LINK---\n\nThere are others. I used to run my store on Volusion. Its a complete retail business platform with tax, payments, customer management, rebates, incentives, marketing, web builder so you don't need to be a web designer guru etc. \n\nGoogle and do some research and budget to set up something like this which will give you greater legitimacy and options. If you can't or aren't ready to take this type of a step at least plan and budget for it for a future date. \n\nLook at whatever industry/trade journals are available to your business and join those organizations and read their material. \n\nGoogle where the next industry tradeshow, or outdoorsy trade show in your area is. Go to it and start to market yourself nad your \"brand\". \n\nDon't ask your family and friends for advice for 2 reasons. 1 they have no idea what your vision is but they mean well so they won't give you the right advice and 2 some of your friends might not want you to succeed because their lives suck and they would rather see you right by them then succeed, they won't be helpful either so don't bother. \n\nAsk instead on Reddit or poll your customers or people who you think are your target audience. \n\nIn terms of your Etsy store the images are ok but not what I would call \"store quality\". \n\nGet a lighbox and if you can't afford one you can Google how to make one yourself. Amazon sells different ones so look at a few and read reviews. \n\n---LINK---\n\nuse your iphone/android or borrow someone's phone that has a GOOD camera. Put your bags in that box and take the pictures at the highest resolution possible. Make each image consistent for every product. So front, side, 45 degree angle etc, and then take a shot of you holding each bag or use some females that you know but have them standing in front of a white background devoid of clutter. What you want to achieve is consistency in your images so your products show off as quality. \n\nAs far as your product descriptions don't say \"\nI say \"we\" carry this or that or just say product is available in such and such. \n\nyou say for example - The first 3 photos are what I have in stock now. Your order will come with a random pick (unless specified). you don't need to reference yourself.  \n\nif you had your own site or were on some other platform then Etsy I would tell you to break out all your products into categories so they ar listed properly on the main page and to make it look better but its Etsy so you have to conform to their layout. \n\nGet an email address at a .com so yourname@yourbuisness.com not a personal one @gmail.com so later when you have to contact retail places, distributors, manufacturers etc you seem legit. \n\nGet an EIN or Tax ID number from the IRS. One day you will need one. \n\nLastly don't get discouraged. You have taken the first step to being your own boss and doing what you love for a living. That is a great thing! Now just remember that its sales and its never ending.  \n\n", "subreddit": "smallbusiness", "edited": 1448847703, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qr34", "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": "1448846860", "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3urk6q", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1450110735, "author": "diglyd", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_3urk6q"}

Since it sounds like you have a lot of experience in online selling, I'm wondering if you can provide me with some tips regarding the phone # and address info. I am not currently working in my Mom's basement, but pretty close :) I am currently working out of my apartment storing inventory in an empty room. Should I be listing my home address more publicly? Also, I don't have a 1800 number (just my personal cell phone). I was contemplating a free Google number but they are completely out of Seattle area codes and I thought it would be strange to have a phone number in another city or state. I noticed a lot of other small boutiques like mine do not list a phone number either, only a contact us form. Is this a huge deal breaker? I may just need to add a home phone. Is it a problem if it's not toll free? \n\nFinally, when I was looking up the SSL seal Shopify advised that their Shopify Secure  seal would be sufficient. I'm guessing that's not the case based on your comments. I believe they use Geotrust, which is what every site they host uses by default. From your experience does the GeoTrust seal hold greater weight? \n\nAgain, thank you soo much! I really appreciate it.
