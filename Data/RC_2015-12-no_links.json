{"id": "cxj260y", "body": "Hi, \nMy thoughts on your lack of sales is simply this, you are selling higher end products that cost much more than their cheaper affordable rivals. Straight away your target demographic is shrinking. I'm guessing that your are targeting women, Getting even smaller now. \n\nYour advertising on Google Ads and Facebook Ads. Is that where your target demographic look for Expensive shoes, bags and jewellery? Probably not.\n\nWomen are extremely tactile, they like to touch and feel items before purchasing. \n\nYou offer free worldwide shipping, you may as well state that you have inflated your prices to incorporate shipping. This isn't free shipping, it is built in shipping. This makes people question the pricing. Your free shipping offers no guarantees, no information about time it takes to dispatch and receive the product and no information on tracking etc. \n\nHow about adding a delivery page to build some confidence that if a customer drops $250 for a bracelet they will actually receive it.\n\nYour product photos are ok, but not outstanding. Your selling the dream, why not show someone enjoying the dream. Vacation/Holiday companies do not simply show a beach, they show familys/people ENJOYING the beach. They are selling the dream...not the holiday. Think about doing some insitu shots of your products, and whilst your at it shoot the products from different angles (or consider a 3d spin?).\n\nShoppers are saavi, particularly the ones that spend large sums online. Your site doesn't hit SSL until you get the the 'hosted' shopping cart (awful shopify cart).\n\nWhat happens if a customer is unhappy with their purchase? Hows about a page explaining your returns and refunds policy?\n\nDo you offer a Authentic Guarantee that shows your goods are high quality and authentic snake skin etc?\n\nDon't think why am I not making sales, think what do I need to convince people to buy. \n\nConsider some deeper market research. Revise your Paid ad campaign. \n\nSEO, well your on page seo needs attention, but offsite SEO you need content first, get that blog going, consider hiring a female writer. Outreach to bloggers, check out fashion bloggers, find one whom is popular, has a great readership and reach out to them, send them a freebie to review. A solid review from a well known blogger is worth its weight in marketing gold. \n\nInstagram and Pinterest are going to be great social channels for you as they are 90% visual, have huge female audiences and tend to show aspirational products. \n\npm me if you would like to speak further about this.\n", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": 1448975910, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1448975502, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3uyipj", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "northernbloke", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1451367444, "parent_id": "t3_3uyipj"}

{"body": "Hey guys and gals, \n\nI'd like to use this opportunity to start a League of Legends based clothing brand. Here is a [link]---LINK--- for those who have never heard of the game. I've been a huge fan of the game for a few years and came up with the idea a little while ago, but never jumped on the opportunity.\n\nThe most recent [article]---LINK--- I can find says there are 67 million different people playing the game every month. This is a huge market that is saturated with low quality designs. Most of the shirts I can find are on amazon or redbubble and are player created. I have not been able to find any brands that focus on this niche. I think creating a brand that is identified with a unique art style or witty designs could thrive in the marketplace. I do not have any experience with teespring, printful, or shopify to know which is better or if there is an even better system out there. \n\nWe could initially announce the brand by posting on /r/LeagueofLegends and asking players to vote on their favorite designs. This would be great market research and help us limit our designs to designs people actually like and would purchase.\n\n\n**Obstacles:** \n\n* **Our primary obstacle** would be creating the designs for the t-shirts. I have limited experience with Photoshop and very limited experience with Illustrator. I can edit image, but i am not artistic enough to create original images. I would most certainly like to have at least one or even two graphic designers join my team. \n\n* **Our second largest obstacle** would be creating the website. I believe editing a template would be the faster and more efficient way to design the website, however I am no expert and I am sure someone skilled in web design would be much faster than I. I would like to have a skilled web designer join my team.\n\n* **Our third largest obstacle** would be marketing the brand on the internet. There are a lot of blogs, forums, and streamers to help spread the word about the website and brand. I do not know much about SEO, but would be excited to learn. I also don't know much about blogging or advertising to blogs/streamers (just as eager to learn). I would like someone with some expertise on internet marketing and SEO to join my team.\n\n* **Our fourth largest obstacle** would be writing. I would also like to have a writer join my team to help reach out to advertising sources (blog owners, streamers, forum posts) , as well as, help generate material for the website. I think having a blog on the website may be a good way to draw attention from LoL players and would appreciate a writer or blogger to help create content.\n\n* **Our last obstacle** would be creating original design ideas. This seems like the most important obstacle, I put it last because this not something a specific personal would be necessary for. Another person could join solely to help create design ideas that are relevant to the culture and unique from other designs. However, I believe this obstacle is best tackled as a group. I would like to start the project by brainstorming design ideas with all members of the group. The more members who have experienced the game and more importantly the culture would make more relevant designs....and more profitable ones. I would like to have at least one member of my team be familiar with LeagueofLegends and the culture surrounding it (preferably someone who plays the game).\n\n \n**My skills:**\n\nThe skills I can contribute include front end website building (I've been fairly successful at editing templates / No Javascript for me), writing, market research, basic, and design ideas.\n\n\n**My Team:**\nI am looking to construct a team consisting of\n\n*  2 Graphic designers\n*  1 Web developer\n*  1 SEO / Online marketing specialist\n*  1 Professional writer\n\nI would like at least one of those members to be knowledgeable about league of legends culture.\n\n\n**Communication:**\nWe would most likely communicate using slack and a mutual google account.\n\n**Equity:**\nMy ideal situation would be to personally own 25% and divide the remaining 75% equally between 5 team members. (15% each) \n\n**Money management:**\nWe would use PayPal to pool our funds. I believe $10 each would be enough to cover the only 100% necessary cost: web hosting. I believe some optional investments would be advertising credits and capital to send promotional products to bloggers or streamers. It's my understanding that shopify and similar print sites do not require initial capital for stock. Just designs. \n\n**Availabity:**\nMy time zone is -5 GMT (East Coast of the US) and I will be available unless I'm sleeping. My girlfriend went to visit her parents so I was going to spend the weekend playing LeagueofLegends, but this is a way better idea.\n\nPlease reply if your interested in joining or even if you just have some advice that might make the idea more successful. Thanks for reading!\n\n**TLDR:** Shirt brand based around League of Legends gaming culture. If you are interested go back and read the post before asking to join the team.\n", "id": "cxnhfmj", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": 1449275689, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1449269866, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3vffzy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "ups": 2, "author": "Meatboll", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1451444086, "parent_id": "t3_3vffzy"}
{"id": "cxnhi8v", "body": "It really depends on how much flexibility and power he needs.  There are three significant players in this space.  Bigcommerce, Magento, and Shopify.\n\nMagento is definitely the most powerful of the three, but the Spiderman principle applies; with great power, comes great responsibility.  You can bend Magento to do almost anything, but you'll also be responsible for dealing with the core php and database.  Security patches are up to you, bugfixes are up to you, server architecture (if he gets much traffic, he'll need multiple servers with load balancing) is up to you.  The plus side is that its got a MASSIVE community and it's easy to find strong partner agencies to help out.  The cost is prohibitive for a lot of people though, you'll pay $17.5k/yr/license (server) as well as the cost for the actual server space/load balancers/firewalls/etc.\n\nShopify is probably the easiest of the three (for the store owner, it's kind of a bitch for front end guys because it uses a proprietary language as opposed to straight HTML/CSS/JS).  If you don't need significant power and are truly starting from ground zero, it's simple to get set up and theres not much room to screw yourself with features you don't understand.  The costs are pretty negligible.  If my Mom decided she wanted to start selling trinkets online, Shopify would be a strong contender.  It lacks in features, but that really only matters if you need those particular features.\n\nBigcommerce is a good middle-ground.  It's still SaaS (like Shopify), but it's a lot more powerful and uses industry standard coding/markup.  It's simple to manage, but has a really strong API and a great support infrastructure/community.  You eliminate the costs of hosting infrastructure, but are still able to leverage a very fast CDN, great threat mitigation, and real-time load balancing.  Your tradeoff with anything SaaS (BC and Shopify in this example) is that you have no access to the core php.  You can get into the front end code all day long, but you're limited to client side.\n\n**Fair disclaimer: I've worked in the BC environment for about four years in basically every capacity.

{"id": "cxokh0i", "body": "As the tech guy for our organization, I can very much appreciate the effort you put in to make an ERP+CRM. I'm sure there's a mind boggling amount of code. \n\nThat all said, one of things I learned as I transitioned to more of a business role is that most companies just want it to work, period. One of the biggest issues you'll face is that even if your system is the *best* system around, you're going to need an army of support people. The first few clients you'll be able to deal with on your own and pull the late nights doing dev and QA while figuring out custom integrations and support. However the revenue from those clients will probably not cover the needs to train and develop support staff. \n\nStitch, TradeGecko, SellBrite, they all have plans starting at $50 to $100 a month. That pretty much doesn't cover the wages for 1 day of support service, since your support guy/gal will need at *least* $40k/yr to be reasonably competent. This means you need 30 small clients just to keep things afloat or land a few enterprise clients. But like I said, enterprise clients really don't want to be guinea pigs and they could generally care less about the price than just making it work. They'll dump $50-$100k into Netsuite or whatever else without a blink of an eye.\n\nSo, you're focused on small players that are wiling to play around. Unfortunately, that means less in-house tech, so more hand holding and more support needs. Of course, they'll eventually become cash-flow positive once they're nice and adjusted but now you'll need to keep finding more clients. All the while, guys like Stitch have secured another $100MM round 2 funding (pulling that out of air, but probably close) and other ERP suits are all rolling deep and can pay $1,000 (pulling number from air) CPA to bring in a customer because they know the LTV is much greater. At that CPA rate, you can bet Donald's tupee that they've got PhD A/B split testing analytics ninjas that drink their competitors PPC shake for breakfast on a regular basis.\n\nThat means if you're not going to win the marketing battle, you need to win on pure merit or pricing. Pricing is a painful and slipper slope, because the cheaper you get, the higher your support and overhead goes, because the money is with enterprise. The leaves merit, which seems to be where you're positioning yourself, but once you find yourself with 100 clients all yelling at you for new feature ABC through XYZ, then you're stuck making everyone happy and you're in a feature race that you're inevitably going to lose.\n\nIf you want to break into this field and don't have any VC backing or funding, I would not, not, not go against these other guys head-up. Carve a very specific niche for yourself. Sellbrite is like ERP on easy mode and is probably the go-to for the Shopify/Etsy crowd. Stitch/TradeGecko/OrderHive is like the SME answer and HubLogix/Skubana are the enterprise bad boys.\n\nAs with all SaaS apps, you need to be able to say how you're different and better. If you don't have the funds, don't play in the big pond - fish in the overlooked areas and I'm sure you'll find your own niche.\n\nOh and the reason I know this pretty well is that I'm writing a giant article on [EcomCrew.com]---LINK--- soon on a ERP+CRM throwdown between all the SaaS providers.\n\n", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": 1449361119, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1449360937, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3vkggs", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "ups": 2, "author": "granto", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1451462775, "parent_id": "t3_3vkggs"}
{"id": "cxol89i", "body": "Hi, you very much hit the nail in the head here. Thanks for your amazing and very long comment. I'm definitely with you on this one.\n\nThe thing is, (if you read my Edit above in the post), I'm already getting some ideas as to how to segment down the customers. And this will eventually narrow down to a specific niche where I will be offering a rather unique thing. You already mentioned 3 classes of customers (Shopify/SME/Entreprise). In the end, maybe it's not going to be ERP at all, but rather some different animal crafted for a specific niche. Still thinking over, you know.\n\nBut your advice is indeed spot-on. \n\nI have no intention to go head-up with any of the big guys, not without VC funding and everything. It'll be a mistake. I have enough entrepreneurial experience to see that the customer slope is the slippery slope here. The business model itself. \n\nBut if you segment the product features right, if you fish for the right customers and not aiming to get a big market share (very unlikely), but instead to do your math and be profitable all the time, then you have your chance of success. \n\nI've been swimming with the sharks for a decade already, in another industry. I'm only about making a profit. I prefer to earn 10k and profit 5k, than to earn 100k and profit 0. We're small in that industry, far less featured than the big sharks, having bigger prices, but our customers love us -- for our care and dedication in our work. So we keep on winning and making a profit year after year. We don't go for whales, we don't go for the smallest customers, we aim somewhere in between and it's right. We do our math right.

All of the app stacks are more or less loose API connections that either: work well, kinda work, or barely connect at best.

You'll have no competition because you'll have a captive audience and if anything, maybe Stitch or whatever platform you specialize in will eventually send you clients because you're such a specialist. They are in the business of building their own platform so they don't do custom work and most businesses HATE paying for custom work if they don't have to, so you could essentially be re-using a lot of code base and making things economical in your little pond. \n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1449380761, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3vkggs", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "granto", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1451467794, "parent_id": "t1_cxom4nu"}

{"id": "cxr43gu", "body": "It's certainly an option, though the results pricing-wise still depend on the business's specifics. \n\nShopify doesn't actually (currently) require you to use a particular processor. Here's their list of supported gateways: ---LINK---\n\nNotably on there is Authorize.Net, which is one of the most popular gateways out there, and one that's supported by a lot of processors. So a Shopify merchant could have their Shopify store, an Authorize.Net payment gateway through their processor, and a processor to handle the payments. \n\nStripe's at 2.4% and $0.30? Must have gone down, they were at 2.9% and $0.30 at one point. \n\nIt's partly dictated through the card companies, yes, and the banks that issue credit cards. But the problem with models like those offered by Stripe (and PayPal, and Square, etc.) is that the flat rate model doesn't pass any savings along to you if and when savings would occur.\n\nThere's 3 components of processing costs - interchange, assessments, and markup. Interchange is usually the biggest component, and it's non-negotiable. Interchange fees go to the banks that issue credit cards. There are a few hundred interchange categories, and they all have rates and fees associated, depending on different factors like what type of card it is and how it's accepted. (For rough examples, rewards cards are more expensive to process than non-rewards cards, swiped cards are less expensive than keyed, etc.) Assessments are fees that are paid to the card brands themselves (Visa, MC) and are also non-negotiable. Together, interchange and assessments can be thought of as the base cost or even 'wholesale' cost of processing, because everyone's paying them and they don't change. (I mean, they do, they change every 6 months - year, but they change for everyone, and are thus \"consistent\" in a relative sense.)\n\nWhere there's wiggle room/negotiating power is in the markup, which is what the processor is making to handle the transaction on your behalf. \n\nThere are a bunch of ways processors can charge you, though. They can use what's called tiered or bundled pricing, which we generally advise people to run away from as fast as possible. Tiered is expensive and opaque. You don't really know what's being charged or how, because processors can basically just do whatever the heck they want. It's a disaster. (But it also looks competitive sometimes, due to smoke and mirrors.) I can go into it more tomorrow if you're interested.\n\nThen there's what we require processors to use in CardFellow, which is called interchange plus with true pass-through. What this means is that processors will charge you the actual wholesale cost to process each transaction, and add their markup as a separate component. You can see what it is, and it's usually quite competitive. This also means that when you process very low-cost transactions, like, say, regulated debit cards, which could be 0.05% and $0.21, you're only paying that and then the processor's markup. (Regulated debit cards being defined as cards issued by banks with $10 billion or more in assets, so your big guys - Chase, BofA, Citibank, Wells Fargo, etc.)\n\nContrast this with the flat-rate. With something like a 2.4% and $0.30, blanket on everything, it's simple to understand, but not necessarily the most competitive. Why? You don't get the benefit of the fluctuations in card type costs. The 2.4% + $0.30 is meant to cover everything - interchange, assessments, and markup - and you don't see how much of it goes to which fee. So you don't know how much is the processor's profit.\n\nIf a card costs 2.2% wholesale to process, then fine, they're making .2% on your transaction, nothing to write home about. But if we go back to that 0.05% one? Suddenly they're making 2.35% on your transaction as profit.\n\nI'm simplifying the math a bit here because it's late and it's easier to demonstrate the possible savings, but that's the gist. You don't get the benefit of lower cost transactions, the processor on a flat rate model does. They get it as profit.\n\nI'll note here that it does still depend on different factors, like the average ticket size, the types of cards you take, etc. There are times when a flat rate solution can be perfectly logical for a business. This is particularly true for small average ticket businesses. If your transaction totals are under $10 on average, by all means, go with a Square or a Stripe. (Heck, the processor may be LOSING money on some of your transactions at that point. Square lost ~$30 million processing for Starbucks. It's not because Starbucks doesn't have the volume!)\n\nNon flat-rate processors also have the ability to tweak the ratio of percent or cents charges to help benefit you, as well. For example, if you do a lot of transactions, 30 cents per can add up pretty quick. So maybe the processor tells you they'll drop it to 10 cents per transaction or 5 cents per transaction, in exchange for bumping your percentage up half a percent, or something. Depending on the specifics for that business (the average transaction size, the number of transactions, etc.) that math could actually work out better, even though people sometimes see larger percentage and think it automatically means less competitive. \n\nSo that's the long explanation of how yeah, costs are dictated in part by other entities, but the processor still has a lot to do with it. We make sure that processors are offering transparent, competitive markups, and then we monitor your processing to make sure that you're getting the best rates you can be at the interchange level as well. (Downgrades - when a transaction gets bumped into a more expensive interchange category. Often avoidable, and we watch for it and tell you how to avoid it. Sometimes it's basic things like using address verification.)\n\nAnd this whole post also gives a little glimpse into exactly what we do, and why it's way easier to just have us do it for you. ;)  \n\nThis has been CardFellow with Behind the Scenes of Credit Card Processing for r/entrepreneur. :P", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1449545199, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3vuho7", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "CardFellow", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1451506616, "parent_id": "t1_cxr25py"}

If you choose not to go the \"printed to order\" route through an online company, like a few others have suggested, you should find a printer that you can trust and explain to them your vision for the brand and what challenges you may be facing and see if they will work with you to reduce minimums.

{"body": "**1) Look at the Market**\n\nIf this item is super cheap, chances are many have thought of the same thing. Is the market saturated? if not, proceed. If so, you could eat up your $500 budget very quickly. \n\n**2) Look at the Product**\n\nGet a sample of the item and make sure it meets the quality level your potential high paying customers would expect. \n\n**3) Set up a Store**\n\nThis may be a better option than trying to find a dropshipper, and more profitable than affiliate marketing - but thats for you to decide. I would use Shopify as they are cheap, easy and will give you advice on how to set things up. Spending the $20 bucks for a month and domain is a great test for you. \n\n**4) Figure out your Shipping.** \n\nShipping can be expensive depending on your area of the world. If you're in the US and only shipping to the US, you'll likely be fine with USPS. If prices are decent on shipping and margins are good, you may consider doing free shipping, or offering free shipping promotions. \n\n**5) Sell your stuff**\n\nAdvertise on facebook and google (or instagram, twitter and pintrest if thats where your target market is). There are plenty of guides on key words and such to get people to your product. Its not free, its not always cheap, but if your margins are there then it can be worth it. \n\n**6) Automate it**\n\nIf you're doing well enough and selling tons of stuff, you can automate the process using a fulfillment agency. They charge a few dollars to pack and ship your product to customers and can pull data right from your shopify site. you can also get your product shipped directly to them so you dont have to handle it. This can save you tons of hours and essentially becomes just like dropshipping. \n\nKeeping email lists can help you sell new products to old customers, if your business makes it that far.\n\nThe big thing I would recommend is that even though this is a basic formula, this is still a risk. If you aren't willing to put down your $500 on a hand of blackjack, or the turn of the roulette wheel - you may be setting yourself up for disappointment.  \n\nBest of Luck.", "id": "cxt5qt5", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1449689298, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3w3snn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "Twice_Knightley", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1451541966, "parent_id": "t3_3w3snn"}

{"body": "It's tricky. Github supports a ton of other open source initiatives. I don't want to trash them for this 1 thing they're not doing. They also employ TMM1 and CharlieSome which both contribute to MRI. I think it's unfair to only focus on the largest orgs. For example shopify is huge, but don't sponsor full time Ruby core devs. However they do sponsor lots of work on Rails. Heroku doesn't have any full time Rails contributors.\n \nRuby doesn't have a Google that can drop absurd amounts of cash on the language without batting an eye. What we need is lots of smaller players to contribute a little instead of a few players contributing a lot.\n\nIt might be more economical than you might think. Let's say by hiring a full time Ruby core developer Ruby will get 5% faster year over year so your application will get faster year over year. This means 5% less time that your engineers need to spend optimizing for speed and instead focusing on shipping features. If you take that time savings across 20 employees, then the result comes to be 1 extra employee. So if your shop employs 20 Ruby devs, add a head count and hire someone to work on Ruby core. The best part is that the more companies that do this, the more improvements we see net.

{"body": "So this is pretty darn complex. Is the internet a server that acts as a single point for the entire system? Like is there a giant shutoff button in the mountains of Colorado? I'm sorry for the ignorance, just trying to figure out what makes this different than the internet nad hosting a website.\n\n&gt; Firstly, although the people running it are known, the code is open sourced and copied on many many different computers.\n\nOh, so it's like the http standard? And OB is just like... loading Magento onto an apache install? That makes sense. Ok, what else? Don't go too fast for me, I'm an idiot.\n\n&gt; If the people running it are coerced or stopped, the code and the project will continue.\n\nOk... so sort of like the internet? If this is true, why are there so few people in your community contributing code now? Seems like a majority of ya'll are spectators.\n\n&gt; each person runs their store on their own computer.\n\nRight... sorry, just trying to keep up. So... if they are running their own store on their own computer, then isn't that a little like running your own website on your computer? Wait a second, what happens if your store gets used a lot? Where will you host it? Because I think that a lot of people accessing your store would gum it up... I guess if I were going to have a well-used store, I'd put it on an instance of Amazon. But that seems like it's getting to close to looking like a website now... I guess I'd just buy a faster computer and I'd pay like an extra couple thousand bucks to purchase like a huge amount of bandwidth into my home. Hope no one DOSes me since the data line probably is too small for someone to even try to distribute it. But I'm sure you have thought of fixes to that since I'm the idiot.\n\n&gt; While individually some people may have their servers raided or shutdown, it's impossible to raid everybody, and the majority of the stores will continue to operate\n\nOk, this is interesting. I was under the impression that the entirety of OB would be shut down if even one store was raided. I guess that's not true. So, OB operates almost exactly like the internet right? Like if I'm selling pills from Canada in my store, and the police raid my home to shut down my website, the whole internet doesn't go down, just my site. Do I have that right? So, not to be too prideful, I'm not certain, so you'll have to clarify, but if someone raids a node operator, is the information in the Bitcoin network affected? Or does all the information stay on all the nodes? Because what you just described feels a lot like the internet and a lot less like a decentralized system. But I wouldn't know. I'm retarded. Please explain.\n\n&gt; Third, many of the stores on OB may be run by individuals who wish to remain mostly anonymous, and so they will be run on servers that are either behind something like Tor hidden services\n\nThis is a good point. So, I get the sense that you're under the impression that this works with Tor. that would be pretty neat if it did. But since it's written on UDP, I believe it doesn't. But I'm the idiot, so you should probably double check for me. ---LINK---, let me make it easy for you to double check.\n\n&gt; they will simply be mirrors or redirects to other servers\n\nInteresting. Too bad the system nakedly broadcasts your IP... at least that's what I've heard.\n\n&gt; OB uses Bitcoin and multisignature escrow as the payment system, so while traditional stores that get raided or shutdown get their funds confiscated and are thus permanently crippled, that cannot happen when an OB server gets shutdown or its owner strong-armed or arrested.\n\nWhew, I thought it was using something like VISA that a lot of people use. Ok, so it's good to hear that they will be using Bitcoin. So can you quickly explain why this is any different than setting up Shopify (which also takes Bitcoin), and if your answer is that it takes bitpay or coinbase, then can you explain why this is any different than setting up Magento and adding any Bitcoin address you want to the system?\n\n&gt; Do you understand yet why you are wrong?\n\nI'm getting there.

{"body": "I think you're going to get a wide range of responses on how much a website should cost because there is no real answer.  It all depends on your requirements and what you're looking for.  Obviously a custom build is going to be a lot more expensive than getting someone to use a template and customizing it or building a website on Wix.\n\nThat being said...I'm in the process of building a couple of websites with completely different scopes.  For custom web development, it really depends on what you're asking for.  If you're looking to cut costs, my advice is to find someone who has experience in building some similar type of app, platform, etc.  I was recently quoted around $50,000 for the development of a web application from someone who had never done it.  However, I found someone who had literally just finished something similar and they came in at $25,000 since they already had a lot of coding they could use and knew exactly what to do.\n\nYou can find a lot of agencies and freelancers who will customize templates on Shopify, Wordpress, etc. to make a site look completely unique and only charge around $2000-$3000.  For custom builds for the same type of websites, I usually expect between $10,000 to $20,000.    When you're getting into huge websites, it's really a crap shoot.  \n\nYou have to determine what the website means to your business.  Is it your primary medium for doing business?  Is it just to present some information to people?  Is it your storefront?  All of these questions will help you answer how much you should spend.  If you're an Ecommerce website that only operates online, I would say you should budget a good amount for a website.  The question is hard to answer because it's like asking how much will you pay for a car?

Shopify would be handling all the functionality, but it would exist virtually within your PageCloud pages. \n\nAny widget (including e-commerce) that exists in an iFrame, can simply be pasted on to a page However, this is not something you'd want to do if you had a Wal Mart size inventory.\n\nFor other eCommerce providers that don\u2019t offer iFrame embed options, a developer may be required to integrate.

Pages need to load lightning fast, live listings shouldn't save until I actually hit save and mean to save them (saving unnecessarily wastes times and possibly introduces errors to live listings) -- don't make them save every time I hit \"tab\" to go to the next field, or upload a photo -- and fields should be prioritized from most commonly revised to least common so I don't have to scroll all the way to the BOTTOM OF A SLOW LOADING PAGE every time I need to do something routine like update a description or change a quantity. Inkfrog, yes, I'm looking at you. Quantity, description, price, title, category, store category, and shipping information need to be above the fold ... \n\n(As a side note, fancy and pretty state of the art HTML 5.0 has its place, but its place is not in a production environment. It's too slow and too prone to causing browser crashes.

It only creates delays when the page freezes for several seconds when the entry is half-typed to generate a list of (wrong) items.\n\nIt needs to be fairly idiot resistant. I shouldn't be able to accidentally create a duplicate listing because I made an incorrect keystroke, back out (and lose) a partially completed listing due to a keystroke error, etc. Don't make it save every time I hit \"tab\". Don't make it flash up a pop up box offering assorted options whenever I touch my mouse -- that's just plain annoying. \n\nAn app that I could download onto my computer, and QUICKLY enter in data for listings, then quickly upload that data in batches, would be very welcome. \n\n(Side note, if you're a programmer: Shopify needs an app that resides entirely on the user's computer, works independent of the cloud -- i.e., it works without an internet connection -- and uploads listings in batches. Right now, if I don't have an internet connection, I can't work, and I'm almost always hobbled by lagging servers during peak hours.

{"body": "I've had very mixed experiences with Paypal. I've had enough bad experiences that would stop taking Paypal if there was a viable (read: popular with buyers) alternative. I do take credit cards for off eBay sales. \n\nHowever, I will say that Paypal has gone to bat for me twice -- once when eBay instituted Paypal holds on me (I've been selling from the 90s and have basically a perfect record), apparently because we'd created an LLC and a new business Paypal account even though the store was the same, and once when eBay double billed my selling fees and overdrew my checking account. \n\n(In the latter case, eBay could not see that they'd double billed so they fought me every step of the way on fixing it, and then when they finally conceded they'd double billed, they \"refunded me\" ... but sent the refund to the wrong account. The refund went to one of their own corporate Paypal accounts rather than my Paypal account!  So first eBay's system showed no double billing, then all the CSRs could see was that a refund had been issued.) \n\nThe overbilling took three months to sort out, but it was an upper level Paypal manager who cared enough to step in and fix it, and the problem was probably a bit below his pay grade but he took it personally ... he finally just issued me a credit (for several hundred dollars) and said they'd take it up with eBay at their next \"quality control\" meeting. I ended up talking to the bigwig because lower level employees would bump me up the chain of command when they realized that there was a problem that needed to be addressed, and THEY couldn't fix it themselves. That's a refreshing change from eBay employees, who pass the buck by hanging up when they can't fix a problem ... \n\nSo Paypal is a mixed bag. If you're persistant, they'll do the right thing, but it can take a lot of work and time and irritation to get them to do it.\n\nI have nothing nice to say about eBay's customer service or policies.

However, I am not really representative of the average user, so YMMV when it comes to the average seller.   Some sort of form, however, however, is what I'm kinda looking for and haven't been able to find amongst all the many third party apps that are out there.\n\nFrom my standpoint, it would just need to be quick, efficient, upload the photos itself*, be accurate, and allow me to tab from field to field. Pretty isn't necessary, just a nice clean and FAST design in a program that was resident on my home computer. \n\nFrom a \"make it idiot resistant\" standpoint, the input form should probably only handle one listing at a time, instead of many listings on one page. However, a spreadsheet view of the data would occasionally be handy for mass revisions before posting.\n\n*Shopify actually supports uploading listings from a spreadsheet however, in testing it with some large uploads of 100+ listings at a time I can tell you that it's not ACCURATE when you try to do more than a few at a time. Which defeats the purpose. The data gets munched, for reasons I don't fully understand but probably have to do with small formatting errors in the data leading to dramatic errors in the listings ... \n\nAlso, you can't upload photos when you load listings with a spreadsheet. This is a huge problem if you're trying to upload tons of listings (which I generally am.) \n\nYou have to upload the photos to Shopify's database manually, or to a server or photo hosting site somewhere. \n\nThen you find the listings you just uploaded and copy-paste the link for each photo into the spreadsheet. Takes forever and ever and ever. It's also an inherently error prone process, for a variety of human-error and computer-error related reasons. Can't tell you the number of times I ended up with the wrong photo associated with a listing before I gave up the whole idea of using a spreadsheet.\n\n(And since I then upload my listings to eBay via Inkfrog, if I don't catch those incorrect photos, I could end up with a major problem with an eBay buyer and/or a defect because, wrong photo.)\n\nI'd think an app could upload the photos to shopify's server and then automatically enter the URL of the photo into the database for the user, saving several steps and lots of time and headache.\n\n(I actually love, love, love Shopify. Overall, it's extremely well designed and a fantastic selling app. It consistently amazes me how much EASIER it is to use than eBay!

You can start with a quick pre-made theme, develop custom apps and add-ons as your business grows, and even move to developing a totally custom web app using their API if needed.\n\nWhat scares me about Shopify is vendor lock-in.  You're really investing in their infrastructure and ecosystem exclusively, and if they decide to squeeze the hell out of you, or their service starts to fall to pieces, then you either have to start all over or just grin and bear it.  \n\nWhereas with WordPress/WooCommerce, or a \"pure\" ecommerce framework like Magento, you have a great deal of flexibility with respect to who you choose to host your app.  There's little to no lock-in.  But with that flexibility, there are a lot of downsides.  Particularly, if you're not very technically-inclined, there's a good chance you're going to set up a WordPress site that takes 20 seconds to load.  I see this all the time, and it's obviously a disaster (even 5 seconds is a disaster).  You're also vulnerable to tons of security issues if you self-host WordPress and don't know what you're doing.\n\nSo like most things in life, it's a trade-off.\n\nAll things considered, I'd recommend Shopify for non-technical types, as long as you go in with your eyes wide open regarding lock-in.", "id": "cy273k0", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1450360734, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3x76cw", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1451697998, "author": "hu5ndy", "edited": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_3x76cw"}

{"body": "For the love of god, please do not try to do eCommerce unless you know what you are doing.\n\n1) There is a very big difference between a simple information site made in a CMS, and a full functioning eCommerce site. You might be able to pull off the former if you are good at learning things as you go.\n\n2) Wordpress and Joomla are not development programs, they are CMSs or Content Management Systems.\n\n3) Do not try to accept credit card payments, or handle monetary transactions in anyway until you know exactly what you are doing. I see large agencies that supposedly specialize in eCommerce run a site for years with security holes the size of barns and loggers that email every bit of card info entered to China. If you can not articulately explain what a cross site scripting or remote execution attack is, you are not ready to develop or maintain an eCommerce site.\n\nThat is not to say that you can not make an eCommerce site happen however. There are hosted solutions that may work for your needs. These types of solutions basically let you tweak the styling on the frontend a little bit, but handle everything behind the scenes to keep you from getting into trouble. See shopify or big commerce.\n\n4) You are not going to find a single resource that covers everything you need to know most likely. You are going to want to break things up into smaller chunks and get good at googling for answers. There are several learn to code sites that offer okish basic tutorials on HTML, CSS, JS and other languages you will need to know.

{"body": "Ok. Because I was asking this exact question a little while ago, I'm going to give you a proper answer. I've built many Woo sites for clients over the years, and I'm currently building out my own personal online store. I wanted to look into Shopify, because It has a lot of deep integration with various apps, and it touted as being a one stop shop for eCommerce.\n\nI really like Shopify.It has some great features, but it's actually very restrictive on a lot of levels. You have to pay full-on subscriptions for 'add-ons' that should really be included features on an eCommerce store (contact forms, email triggers, coupons ect).\n\nWoo is REALLY good at being a great, simple all-in one for small stores. If you sell 100- 200 products, Woo is fine. Woo also comes with a lot of features you'll need and expect right out the box. Yeah, if you buy integration, it's like $80 a pop, but it's actually a pretty small up-front cost when you consider the lack of monthly subscriptions you'll need. True, you'll need to get hosting, but you can get REALLY great managed hosting for like \u00a320 a month. Plus 5 quid monthly for an SSL certificate. So then you can get a nice, full featured site for \u00a325 quid a month (that's less then the basic Shopify plan). If you go to CodeCanyon, you can get a lot of the plugins you need for around $20 each- of varying quality of course.\n\nSo What Shopify has on Woo- is the complete lack of technical knowledge you need. You can get started in like a day if you have everything you need ready. Woo takes more involvement to tweak it for SEO and optimising.\n\nMagento is an enterprise solutions. Much more difficult and resources intensive to set-up. But it's a very involved, all in one if you want to sink some serious dough into running it.\n\nSo I'll end with this: Shopify is a great solution if your needs are simple, and you don't mind sinking some money into the website very month. Woo is great is you want a low cost, very custom store. Magento is Magento, and will take a lot of time and money to set-up and run. But it's a good, enterprise level long term solution.\n\nAs for me- I tried using Shopify- hated how restrictive it is.

It's easy enough to just buy a domain and point the DNS servers to Shopify and it's done. If you go this route and need help, just PM me, takes like 2 minutes. \n\n&gt;What is the situation with paying taxes? What's the rule of thumb for how much you have to pay Uncle Sam at the end of the year with an online store?\n\nWell...there's Fed tax rates, state tax rates, self employment tax and any applicable sales tax. I don't think there's any rough estimate anyone can provide you without knowing your P&amp;L.\n\n&gt;Is there a site that will worry about that all if you pay some monthly fee. Kinda like Ebay/Amazon/Etsy, but I will get to set up my store and have my own domain name?\n\nWorry about your taxes? No. Many people just export data to Quickbooks, though. There are [apps that do that for Shopify]---LINK--- and other cart systems like WooCommerce.\n\n&gt;How do fees work with credit cards in an online store? Say someone pays with Visa - will an amount of the sale be automatically sent over to Visa?\n\nI think it's roughly 3% when you use an ecommerce system like Shopify, and if you build your own system with something like Stripe it's around the same. \n\nRule of thumb is under 5% if you're not in the Adult space and typically around 2% + $0.30 per transaction.\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1450936750, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3y1v6e", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "ups": 2, "author": "TrappStick", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1451829327, "parent_id": "t3_3y1v6e"}

{"body": "I have purchased and ran a few dropshipping businesses and here's my experience:\n\n- Most sites on Flippa are scams - fake stats, websites setup on Shopify with previous customers, sales &amp; transactions imported - their accounts always have little to no history because they replicate and sell their site and then create a new account to do it over and over again. How do you catch this? There are many ways. Check their products in the ecommerce store and search the name, description, SKU and/or images (e.g. tineye.com or google.com/images) and you'll find all the previous and future sites they sold.\n\n- Most dropshipping businesses, with products overseas, deal with ~15-30 day delivery times. This results in an incredibly high chargeback rate and an even more incredibly high amount of dissatisfied customers and back/forth emails and negative reviews on your social media channels. If  you want to run a business that sells product, choose a niche, ship all product to yourself and/or Amazon FBA and then sell directly through them. It's way more expensive to setup but you actually have a chance for success. Or, find dropshippers in the US (and have them ship you product to verify quality and timely shipping; there are a *ton* of garbage dropshippers).\n\n- If the business makes $1,000 profit a month and they aren't selling for $12-18K+ then it either requires a hundred hours to do the work; or, it's not really making $1,000 a month. Nobody in their right mind would sell a passive revenue stream of $1,000 a month for any less than 12-18 months cashflow equivalent.\n\n- If you get access to their ecommerce store (e.g. Shopify), review all transactions and statistics. You may notice a high bounce rate, a lot of their traffic from overseas, and a ton of repeat customers (but very few customers). You may also find reviews (e.g. \"This is an amazing product ~ David\") and then you can search Google to find out how many times the site has been replicated. If it has been replicated more than once, don't buy, it's a scam. There are full time scammers that leverage Flippa, etc. and sell sites they simply replicate.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n- Choose a niche. Riches are in the niches\n- Find your own wholesaler(s)\n- Ship product to yourself, or better yet, to Amazon and use their FBA service. Also sell through Amazon, you can increase your revenue ten-fold if you can find an in-demand product and compete with other sellers.\n- Create your own site (using Shopify, Bigcommerce or similar); buy a visually appealing template, don't try to customize it, just focus on increasing traffic and exposure and selling your quality products\n- Focus on sales, sales, sales. Gain organic traffic, create social media channels, gain fans &amp; followers, make interesting posts 3x a day.\n\nEven with the above you'll be challenged along the way, but you'll learn so much as you go through it that you'll be building real-life business skills. Once you finally get a formula that works you'll be able to replicate those successes and create other businesses targeting new niches. Your momentum will build upon itself.

You can make money without it, but it's designed by a $100b+ company to help buyers find your products - so why not take advantage of that?\n", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1451327598, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3yg3kq", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "ups": 2, "author": "TrappStick", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1451902266, "parent_id": "t1_cydzzxt"}

{"body": "Hey, props on the Phil degree. That shit is hard.\n\nThat aside, I'd just like to preface this that I'm still a student and have never done any hiring myself. Hence, all my comments come from anecdotal experience. However, I was in a similar position: was a PoliSci major first year, Ling major my second, didn't switch into CompSci until the end of my second and didn't write my first independent \"Hello World\" until my third. I had less than a year to get my portfolio ready for internship applications, but now I'm at the end of my 5th year, and I've completed/landed internships at Microsoft, Activision, and Shopify. Hopefully some of my experience can be helpful to you.\n\nFirstly, I would say take off your work experience entirely. Any unrelated work experience *probably* isn't going to help you too much: what you're trying to do with your resume is make it past the resume screening (lots of recruiters for tech companies literally just put your resume through a program that looks for key words). They'll probably judge your interpersonal skills when they, you know, meet you in person. Plus, the unrelated work experience is taking up room on your resume that you could use for something better: projects.\n\nWhat would probably help you most would be to bust your ass doing personal projects with every minute of spare time you have during the rest of your degree. Or even better, make a GitHub account, find an open source project, and make a contribution. Your projects/contributions really *really* don't have to be super impressive or even big; they just need to show that you can learn and get shit done on your own. After all, learning is the biggest part of the job.\n\nWhen I applied to my first internship, I literally had nothing on my resume but Tic Tac Toe in Python, a school project, a C++ library of various algorithms I'd learned and re-implemented during an introductory CS course, and my portfolio website. To add, I had really shitty grades! (I'm bad at math) However, my projects demonstrated knowledge in a lot of areas employers seem to care about: data structures + algorithms, basic understanding of the web, how to structure a program and write modular code, etc etc. I also learned tonnes, had fun, and it gave me lots to talk about during the interviews! A couple of my friends also had similar experiences: pretty bad marks, no work experience. But they liked making games in their spare time, and they've landed past internships at EA, Capcom, Ubisoft, and Relic.\n\nAnd just a last note: when applying for internships, remember to think past just how your resume looks. A pretty standard application procedure goes like this: you'll send your resume, get screened by HR, have to write a Codility (or some other coding screen) test, then get an in-person interview where if you're unlucky you'll have to write code on a whiteboard, and if you're lucky, will talk through interesting tech issues with a full-time dev at the company. So before you start applying, make sure you can do some whiteboard coding (read Cracking the Coding Interview or something) and can discuss the technologies you claim you know.\n\nTL;DR: If you want an internship but have no relevant work experience, replace the work experience section with tonnes of projects. Don't waste space on your resume with irrelevant information. Get ready for the in-person part of interviews too.\n\n(Also, just nit-picking: I'm a little confused by the spacing on your resume. E.G. Why is \"Languages\" more indented than \"Database Project\" in your Technical Experience section?)\n\nEDIT: Wrote more stuff.", "id": "cygtlu3", "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1451526039, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_3ytnai", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1451950915, "author": "heycapitaine", "edited": 1451526649, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_3ytnai"}

Otherwise there's Woocommerce, a wordpress addon, which is free but tales more effort into setting up. If you need graphic stuff I'd be happy to help you. \n\nIf I recall, you're not allowed to mention your standalone site to sell your products on Etsy, as if they find out you might get suspended, or something like that? Because they view it as loss of sales when you forward an Etsy customer to your external site. I don't know where I read it, but I'd keep that in mind. My domain used to be a blog with tutorials but I couldn't keep up and ended up just forwarding it to my etsy shop. \n", "id": "cyhrxy3", "subreddit": "Etsy", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq24", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1451603217, "author_flair_text": "", "link_id": "t3_3yyel1", "author_flair_css_class": "", "score": 2, "ups": 2, "author": "briekachu", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1451967318, "parent_id": "t3_3yyel1"}
