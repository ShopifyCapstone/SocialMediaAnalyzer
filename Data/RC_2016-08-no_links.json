When someone says they want/need a quick Wordpress site, what they really need is a simple Squarespace site. \n\n**Blogging** - Jekyll. Has a bit of a learning curve with getting used to writing with Markdown, but seeing as you use reddit, you've likely already used Markdown! It's the text formatting standard used by Reddit! Realistically Markdown shouldn't take a new user more than 5 minutes to grasp. Bonus Jekyll points: you get free hosting on Github for your jekyll sites!\n\nThat's a good start, but in all honesty if it comes down to building and maintaining a business site, I highly recommend finding a reputable web developer and investing the money to get it done properly, though for something super simple anything I mentioned will more than fill your needs.

Our retailers have used Modalyst to add over 500,000 products from these suppliers to their own web stores. \n\nCurrently we integrate with Shopify through an app for both retailers  and suppliers (although we will be integrating with WooCommerce and BigCommerce in the coming months as well). For retailers, the app is an API integration that allows Shopify users to click to add products directly to their online stores including imagery, product info and inventory levels. \n\nAs an automatic data feed between your online store and Modalyst, the app will update inventory levels in real time as well as sync orders so that when a customer purchases a product on your site, Modalyst will automatically submit the order to the Supplier. That means all you have to do is purchase the product on Modalyst and the Supplier will ship it directly to your customer.\n\nFor Suppliers, our Shopify app integrates with your Shopify inventory, and syncs product information, inventory levels and orders. Any changes made to products in your Shopify store will be automatically reflected in your Modalyst Item Manager.

{"body": "That is a super thorough, detailed response - so am not sure I have much to add on the capabilities of the platform itself. However, from the perspective of a platform that integrates into Shopify, we find that the Shopify platform as such is very developer-friendly and the APIs are very intuitive to use. Of all the e-commerce platforms out there, I would venture to say that their app store makes for the most seamless integration experience. While that might not have a direct benefit for you as a site owner, it is a significant derived benefit because it facilitates a better, more robust set of apps on the platform. Especially given how rapidly the digital marketing space is evolving, I think a solid developer ecosystem bodes well for the Shopify platform. Sure it adds additional cost, but I believe it'd still be a favorable comparison for them against the competition. After all, the really good apps on the other platforms aren't free either and a lower TCO should tilt the balance in Shopify's favor. \n\nAlso, on a related note, Shopify is certainly positioning itself as a very progressive brand/platform. They've typically been the first big platform to build native integration into a lot of compelling partners in recent times - Facebook (Messenger, Shop-on-Facebook), Pinterest Buyable Pins, Apple Pay, Same day delivery with Uber, Twitter Buy Now. While a lot of these features might not have become mainstream use-cases (yet), the thought-leadership and their attention to the rapid evolution of the ecommerce space is definitely a plus. And they've also generally been much more mobile-ready than some of the more traditional platforms - of course, it also helps that they are a classic SaaS play. I'm not sure how relevant this is to the vertical that you are in, but if I was getting ready to set up my own store right now, I'd put Shopify on the top of my list as far as platforms go.", "id": "d60ubol", "subreddit": "shopify", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sn78", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1470133705, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4vohlr", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1473151896, "author": "arvind_krishnan", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_4vohlr"}

{"id": "d62ir1f", "body": "&gt; Who can I go through to create the clothing with my designs?\n\nso if it's your first time trying to sell something online, you should definitely use a print-on-demand fulfilment company. The two big ones in the US are;\n\n- [printful]---LINK---\n-  [printaura]---LINK---\n\nSo instead of bulk-ordering a bunch of shirts, you use these guys to print and ship as and when you get orders. You just give them your artwork file, they print it (Direct to Garment) and ship it out for you. Profit margins per-shirt-sold won't be as big as screen-printed, but no start-up costs, inventory or shipping hassle. \n\n&gt; What websites are best to use for selling the products?\n\nIf you have original designs then you could start with sites like Redbubble, [Teepublic]---LINK--- and DesignbyHumans. You just upload your artwork file and they do the rest. (ie. you don't need to have your own website.). They have decent organic audiences and strong SEO game so if your ideas and designs are good AND you give them relevant and appropriate titles and tags, you should be able to pick up sales this way. \n\nIf you'd rather not do it through someone else's platform, you could try Etsy as a kind of halfway house. That way you look like an independent brand, and customers are dealing directly with you. As above, use Printful/printaura to fulfil orders as they come in. \n\nOr if you want to go the whole hog you can launch your own site, using something like shopify or woocommerce. These are simply tools to help you build an ecommerce store (both printful and printaura integrate with both), so you will have to do all the marketing and traffic generation yourself in order to get sales, if you go this route. \n\n&gt; What are the legalities of opening the business? I am assuming I would have to get a business license LLC, but is that it?\n\nI really wouldn't worry about it at this point. Until you sell something for a profit, you don't have a business.

Does anyone else feel this way?\n\nI used to feel that way, until I learned to prioritize only the very core of the business. It saves a lot of time, and lots of effort. If selling the product is your business, then were I in your shoes, I'd want to know if the product actually sells before doing any of that other stuff.\n\n.\n\n&gt; What do you do when you're frustrated?\n\nI take a break from everything, and do something relaxing. Like a walk in a quiet park, blasting some fools through an online FPS, or just sitting and staring at eternity on a beach. I don't think about the business, nor about the future. I think about other things.\n\n.\n\n&gt; Is there something I'm doing wrong?\n\nWell, you're technically doing things correctly, but that doesn't mean the business will actually work.\n\n.\n\nDid you confirm whether your product(s) is something customers actually want? Since you're in the product business, ideally you should be trying to sell it one at a time. If you start to receive orders more than you can handle, you can set up a simple site that does nothing more than send you an email when they place an order. A simple package design will also do. This allows you to focus more on the business rather than the other stuff. It's only when you start to get large numbers of orders, that setting up a shopify site, and setting up logo/branding, templates, and a more professional label, and such makes sense. And that's also the right time to set up an LLC. Again, if it's just a normal product, and isn't expected to be a danger to folks, then setting up an LLC can be done a little later. That's one way to go about it. It lets you test to see if a product works in the market, and saves you time in case it doesn't, so you can start thinking about selling something else.\n\n.\n\nIn your case, since you already have the wholesale products, and the site ready, you should launch right now. Get the pictures together, and the copy. Then do a test purchase to see if the site is working. Setup analytics later, because you're not going to expect an explosion of traffic right from the get-go. Then do labels. When your propriety products are ready, put them up as soon as possible. Forget about SEO, that's a waste of time. It only comes in handy when you have a lot of traffic already, and you want to streamline that further. Focus more on targeting locations where your potential customers are. You'll see the most fruit from that labor compared to anything else.

Downside is the apps and themes you might want add up quickly to the monthly rate and if you're just starting up it has potential to not be cost effective.

Everything is flat and in the same plane, except for this one blob that casts a shadow on everything else.\n\n* I've been looking at your website for a few minutes now and only now did I realize that the product is a thermostat that can control vents. The main image should be that one that has both the thermostats and the vents in the same picture. The biggest problem is that there's so much going on in the hero video, and the four products that \"Flair Works With\" seem to share the same design language as the thermostat/vents, so my first impression is that your product was a full line of AC units, plus vents, plus the thermostat. Consider changing the works with section to line drawings. I'm still not sure how Flair controls non-central systems since only the vents can be controlled?\n\nUpdate: After watching the video, I realized that the product is not, in fact, a thermostat, but rather a puck/vent for each room that builds on top of a smart thermostat. There's literally no way of knowing that unless you watch the video.\n\n* The typography as a whole could use some work. The text under the thermostat that says \"Puck\" in the blue section is almost comically spaced. I noticed that many sections are just a PNG image, which is easy to make but the typography treatment with aliasing and scaling makes the text difficult to read. I've worked on a few websites so I have this tendency to try to highlight text so I know it's real (and not embedded in the image) and while most people won't do that, the benefits of having real HTML text are definitely noticeable in terms of legibility.\n\n* The margins and padding around many of the sections are insufficient. I'm not a fan of websites that are very un-dense and require a lot of scrolling, but your website is on the opposite end of the spectrum. Product shots and the text around them feel claustrophobic.\n\n* The 72\u00ba in the puck has an odd spacing between the 7 and the 2. As text gets larger, the spacing between them needs to be adjusted down to compensate for the increased legibility. Are you using a variable-width typeface of the numbers? I understand that there could be issues getting it to display properly but this is *the* main shot of your product so it should be flawless, even if you have to tweak it a little.\n\n* I know you already mentioned it but performance is really lacking. The first still image didn't finish loading for me before the video started playing. I'm not on super fast internet but it's still 20Mbps and there shouldn't be performance issues. I understand that you want to be able to display 2X at 1920px width but at least add some JPEG compression. For what it's worth, the fans on my MacBook were spooled up while your site was open, and that's never a good thing.\n\n* I'm personally not a fan of the blue (or the orange). It feels obnoxiously bright and juvenile, and doesn't provide enough contrast with the white body text.\n\n* The footer feels unnecessarily large and empty (e.g. one item per line after the quote), and the payment methods at the bottom are just gimmicky to me. I don't think I've ever visited a site and didn't buy something because my preferred payment method wasn't in the footer.\n\nI honestly think your product is pretty cool and being able to control temperatures in individual rooms in houses with central HVAC is definitely pretty awesome. I don't think your website and design does it any justice though. If you're making everything by yourself and this Shopify site is just a way to get started, I'd definitely understand, but if you paid someone a non-discounted rate to design your site, I'd urge you to look elsewhere.\n\nThe vents themselves look okay, but they could be more distinctive to set your smart vents apart from regular white vents. The puck itself, along with the overall brand identity and typography, could be a lot better, but you'd need to hire a designer.", "subreddit": "hwstartups", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2ukge", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1470384902, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4w8929", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "ups": 2, "author": "DarkHorseLurker", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1473233516, "parent_id": "t3_4w8929"}

{"id": "d65hz8l", "body": "With WordPress, there are 1001 things that can easily break. Of course, the solution 90% of the time is very simple. The problem is, most people do not know those simple little solutions.\n\nOnce again, with WordPress things break. \n\nFor example, let's say you want a nifty little pop up box to show up that asks your visitors to sign up for your newsletter. You know that WordPress has tons of free plugins so you go find a free one. You install it and then what happens? It's not compatible with some other plugin you are using and some sort of functionality on your site breaks. \n\nOk, so maybe using free plugins aren't the best idea. You go find some paid plugin that you purchase. It works great but the author decides to stop supporting it ten months after you purchased it and now it's not compatible with the latest version of WordPress. Time to start all over again. \n\nOk, let's say you finally find a great plugin that you purchased and the author is completely committed to keeping it updated. Great! Oh wait, there is a security vulnerability in your plugin and some chump used a script to install malware on your site that shows users pop up ads of porn sites. What do you do then? Your cheap ass shared hosting won't help and you know nothing about cleaning up a hacked WordPress site. You either pay someone or spend twenty plus hours yourself trying to clean up your site only to have it hacked again because all you did was clean the files and not fix the problem. After all, how in the world would you know how the attacker accessed your site? You're not a professional in this area, you just want to sell some stuff. \n\nAnother example? Another example. Let's say you decide to go with WordPress. You find a nice looking theme over at themeforest and get your site set up. It looks fantastic and is working great! Two months later some stupid plugin that was bundled up with the theme stops working because it's not compatible with the latest version of WordPress. Maybe it's the drag and drop page builder that stopped working. Wonderful, now you can't edit or add any new pages because the page builder is broken. After hours of trying to figure out what's going on, you managed to get your theme updated and get the page builder plugin updated. Now you can finally make the changes you need to. \n\nNope. Too bad son, the theme author made a bunch of changes to the theme with the latest update and now half of your content is jacked up or not displaying at all. Time to spend another two days trying to get your site back to normal. \n\nYou might think those are far fetched examples and I am exaggerating but every example I have given has happened to myself or my clients. \n\nThe WordPress community likes to blab on about how user friendly WordPress is.

There are far more highly educated graduates in Canada now than there are jobs for them.  If they're lucky,  STEM grads manage to get a foot in the door in a U.S. company and never come back.  Why would they?  Hell, I've seen waves of people departing for the start-up scene in places like Berlin - cost of living is far lower than Toronto, and tech salaries are comparable and after a few years you can get residency and access to the $16 trillion European market.  In Canada, want to collaborate with organizations, suppliers, manufacturers, etc. outside of your local region?  Hundreds and hundreds of dollars on a plane ticket, or a ridiculously slow and late train ride are your options.  Compare this to the cost of travel in the U.S. or Europe and I'm amazed it even happens at all.\n\nThe housing market bubble is just soaring to ridiculous heights in our major cities, our economy is not diversified, and we're doing nothing to try to organically retain talent.  I saw a recent article where several company execs were arguing that we should impose financial penalties on Canadian graduates leaving for the U.S.  That mindset alone says volumes.  Instead of thinking of ways to make Canada more competitive and make people *want* to stay here, all they can think of is trying to punish those who are able to leave.", "subreddit": "canada", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1470446056, "author_flair_text": "Canada", "link_id": "t3_4wa7oq", "author_flair_css_class": "CAN", "score": 10, "retrieved_on": 1473246985, "author": "awesome_hats", "edited": 1470459467.0, "ups": 10, "parent_id": "t1_d65i8gn"}

I assume this is more small business/physical location based)\n\nYour plumber analogy sort of works but not fully.  You call a plumber when you can see something is broken.  If your website is bad or non-existant you don't see the customers you lose. So why fix what doesn't appear to be broken.  The answer \"i'll build it myself\" is their way of getting rid of you.  Deep down they know they need a website but you haven't sold them your value.\n\nI differ from lots of others but I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019d want.  The sales flow for me to redesign my website if I have one is a ton of work and frankly overwhelming.   Look you may build we a website but honestly I\u2019m doing the majority of the work.  I have to provide you the text, the pictures and these are things I don\u2019t have.  Where I see wev dev failing is you are focused on only one channel \u2013 my website.  I have multiple channels and odds are I don\u2019t sell on my website.  Low priority for me.  \nHere is what I\u2019d pay for.  I want somebody to come in and say \u2013 \u201cHey, I was looking at your web presence and I think I can help you out.  In your city you rank #8 \u2013 you need to be in the top 3 and you don\u2019t even show up on google local on mobile.\u201d  \nThen follow with the hook.  Did you know that 80% never go to the second page of Google and 50% choose in the top 3.  I think with some work we can get you there.  \nHere is what I offer.  Give me a booklet that shows me your 3 packages.  Package A \u2013 Cheap.  Rebuilds website, makes sure its mobile.  Adds something I don\u2019t have \u2013 like online booking.  We\u2019ll host it \nPackage B \u2013 redesign of website above, build an email list campaign or social media campaign.\nPackage C \u2013 Package A &amp; B \u2013 with a whole new marketing campaign.  You coordinate new photos, give me an outline for text so that I don\u2019t have to think.  Now I can market to my customers via email or facebook, I can use those pictures for print media (local newspaper), I can do flyer mailing to customers, etc.\nPackage D \u2013 custom.\nShow me how you have increased rankings and give me an example of an email campaign.  Figure out the ROI on that.  I have no desire to spend $3k on a website update that you are just going to oursource to India or Phillipines.  I need a marketing group that is driven by my website.

{"id": "d68dz9x", "body": "From my understanding, your point about the lack of start up capital, while applicable to the majority of enterprises, is (shockingly) inapplicable to a significant number of software projects. The means of production necessary to run a startup web application, for instance, are virtually nothing. Every developer already has a computer/Internet access. You can launch a web service cost-free in some cases (free Heroku instance, free tier Amazon Web Services hosting) and nearly cost-free in the majority of cases. The only immediate major expense would be wages... But the free software movement and the legacy of open source exploitation prove that developers *can* in many cases go unpaid for quite a while. I assume this is dependent on the current historical context of developers being in high demand and having either savings from previous full-time jobs or having income from part-time or freelance jobs.\n\nI'm a freelancer who, during downtime over a couple of months, independently designed and coded a fairly complex e-commerce niche web service similar to [Shopify]---LINK--- With another developer or two it would have been much easier.

{"id": "d691pxg", "body": "Okay so after thinking about it and trying different variants i def think you should create a brand called Freeling Faves. Freeling is a documentary about skateboarding you can find it here ---LINK--- Freeling means more about the skateboarding lifestyle and faves is short for favorites obviously. I would jump ship to a clothing store as a part-time job and then two-four months later maybe even around march 2017 start this brand. Until then i would create an account on Instagram with this name and take interest on how people are growing their accounts. Create at least 9 structured posts a.s.a.p. that are deeply rooted in the mentality and this way you have something to make a statement with about your account. Think about it like the right column to be reserved for quotes and memes about skateboarding, the center column to fill with relevant material about the brand, like think about the center like the pitch photo where you present the products you will make. Until you actually have the designs which i will talk about later you need to think about something to fill the center photo with relevant to your brand. Finally the left column i would keep it for everything related to skateboarding, photos from movies, photos with singers that have songs about skateboarding, photos of people with bruises and scars, legends of the skatebaording maybe. I would spend every day for the next months at least 15-20 minutes following and unfollowing relevant people, and maybe 10-15 minutes commenting on photos relevant to your niche. I think that by march you should have an account with about 5000-6000 followers that are into skateboarding.\n\nThe brand.\nFreeling Faves like i said is the best name i can think of and as a tagline i would simply use something like \"What's good?\" because it can mean anything you can think of. I would make a logo for this brand with a band-aid and the F's on the sides or on a vertical. I would set-up a nice blog (shopify has them built-in) when i start with some articles related to skateboarding and the lifestyle. I will find a way to address skateboarders by talking about bruises, scars, venues. 10 best places to skate, 10 nasty-est scars and bruises stuff like that. If you think about what i said so far it will make sense more and more as you go by.\n\nProducts.\nYou mentioned you wouldn't wear good clothes skating that is why i would set-up and think about two different tabs on the website something like ACTION and CHILLAX. The action collection would have some very very simple and much more cheaper tees. Maybe just use screenprinting for the logo on the back and the inside label. The most complex designs for the ACTION collection would be some very scars and tears imitating patterns and maybe some things related to the band-aid and for the CHILLAX collection i would use all sorts of designs like naming different techniques with checkmarks something like OLLIE - CHECKMARK, BACKFLIP (whatever the name is) - CHECKMARK like a list of the things you master. Text designs Scars get me going. Kick/Push stuff, a sweet design of a cop trying to grab you and a text like Bail master or something like this.\nAs an incentive to get people buying i would do some stickers that could be applied to the skateboards with some messages related to your brand and of course give them out for free. Skaters know they are rooted within the streetwear trend and would embrace something like this. Who want to go on and on with that same lame logo that was the same 30 years ago? Get creative. Look at my brand ---LINK--- It is a poker brand but i have no t-shirt with my logo on the chest. I used only creative stuff that poker players recognize easily. Something just for them and that is what you should think about too.\n\nThat is the main line i would go about it but like i said you need a stable income and only use 20% of your income for this because it will take time to grow. For brands that you can use to print your designs on you should search for promotional companies. You have some in Belgium that are quite good and not so well known like B&amp;C and others. See them first when you have the chance and then decide what fits your brand. Don't forget to think about video and how that could be integrated in this idea. Reach out to up and coming influencers in this world. Don't go for the big names just try to make friends with people you like, even people from Instagram that react to what you post.\n\nLet me know what you think about this idea and if you see it happening.

Okay, so maybe Product Tabs isn't a \"basic\" feature, but it sure would be great to have it as a basic feature! \n\nI understand some changes to a theme are going to require a developer to manage, but basic things like being able to change ONLY the Add to Cart button color (without changing any other button or links in a theme) and the SOLD OUT button color would be VERY beneficial. That seems like such a basic fix to me, yet for someone without programming experience, it is definitely a hurdle as it is now.

{"id": "d69hcjk", "body": "Normally not much a very mean person, so I'll be polite about it as much as I can.\n\n1. The graphics on the site need a lot of work. I'm a designer, and I can tell the pastry and coffee on those plates aren't real.\n\n2. Font choices are atrocious. They are barely readable at a quick glance. If you want people to pay attention to something, you'll need to make it where they can get the idea of what you're doing within the first 5 seconds of looking at your page.\n\n3. Don't use black ever for this niche. I'm referencing to the \"$1.99 shipping sale\" on the front page. Black is not a cozy/cute color. Use white, with a more cute-professional font.\n\n4. Never have a product that comes with a random one from the picture. If I have 5 frisbees in my product picture, and they are each different colors, I would want to let the customer choose from a drop down menu what color they would like. If a 10 year old boy got his mom to order a frisbee from my site, and one of the colors is pink, and he received that color, I can't imagine he would be happy. This doesn't completely fit your situation, but it's similar. Let them choose. Ask your supplier for individual pictures of each pen. Your supplier needs to know what you're doing.\nYou think \"my supplier doesn't like dropshipping, but they won't notice only a few orders being sent out to different addresses\". Yeah, you're right. They won't. But what happens when you start making a lot of sales? Your supplier will wonder what's going on, and could possibly ban your account if you kept them in the dark this long. Be honest with them, and ask them for the individual photos. They will most likely be more than happy to comply if it gets them sales.\n\n5. The site is SO STATIC. By that, I mean, nothing moves, or changes color. When I hover over your category items like notebooks/cases/etc, it should change to a slightly brighter color to highlight I have hovered over that category.\n\n6. Stop trying to use the \"SALE\" tactic. I know those pens were never $10.99. Put $9.99 as the price and offer a coupon code at the top of the page. Customers hate sales tactics when they notice them. Grocery stores do a great job with letting sales tactics go unnoticed. \n\n7. Make sure you're prioritising your newsletter. I see a the bottom you have a signup place for that. I have the EXACT same thing on my site because I also use Shopify. Only difference is, mine has a popup box asking you to sign up for a free coupon code.\n\n8. If you're going to dropship from a chinese site, at least change the product names. \"Cute Backpack dot pencil case\" sounds awful. I'm not even a female, and I know how my girlfriend likes to nitpick little details like that. Try \"Dotty\u2122 Pencil Case\". Consumers love brands. Why do you think that Lay's chips sell enormously better than Great Value? Because of brands. Some of their products have better quality, but guess what? They are almost identical and cost the same to produce.\n\n9. Your niche has a huge potential for social media. It's girly. Women make up a lot more % of the purchases online than males.\n\n10. I don't think you're using your niche right. You should market these as girly supplies for younger girls in school. I can't see many female professionals purchasing a good bit of these items other than the mac decals.\n\n\nHope all of that helps. I can also help you with graphics once you try and work on some of the points I listed above.\n\nGreat site, and good idea. By the way, if you are shipping from china, I wouldn't do dropshipping with it. 30+ day shipping times are a turnoff for a LOT of buyers. If not, more power to you.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add, do you not support buyer accounts? There is no where I can find to register/sign in. What if I add a bunch to my cart and close the page only to find it all gone when I come back with my credit card in hand? There are many shopify plugins that can do it with one click.

{"body": "I study comp sci so I can get pretty particular about web design, but I also understand budget and other constraints for indies. It sometimes influences my decision to buy (there's a reason Sixteen92 was my first indie perfume company)\n\nMy favorite is probably Sixteen92 - very clean, easy to navigate, absolutely love the design/aesthetic. It conveys her style very well while still being a pretty sexy website.\n\nPhotos are also huge on making a site look professional - see why Sixteen92 looks so professional: clean, consistent, professional photography.\n\nMany others aren't like notably great like Sixteen92's, but they're definitely usable and modern enough that I don't care. I think like 85% of indies fall into here. Like Fyrinnae - their website is just fine, not notably good, but usable. Solstice Scent is another - I think it's just fine, better than Fyrinnae's, not especially good looking, but does the job just fine and looks good enough and it's clean and organized. A lot of vendors that use Shopify fall into here.\n\nAnother thing is sometimes web design is pretty good (like vcs), but like once you start navigating around, it leaves a lot to be wished for. like with vcs, the only place to find scent descriptions is the scent list. You're supposed to make a wishlist beforehand from their facebook post to make everything easier, but it irks me a bit that each product does not have scent description. Not too many of those types of websites though.\n\nNot a fan of:\n\n- NAVA is a huge offender here. Just the fact that I can't right click on their website drives me nuts. I even think their mobile site is slightly better - including being able to open in a new tab. Also, like why are their FAQ's and intros a product listing? That's weird and could be done better. They also leave a bunch of DC'd stuff up so when you search, it's a mix of DC'd and current, which is annoying. I'd prefer if the DC'd was a list by itself. They have such an extensive catalog - the organization honestly isn't too bad, but the site is just so outdated. \n\n- Dawn's Eyes: funny enough, I kinda preferred the old site better. It was easier to find stuff for me even though the new site is \"prettier,\" I guess. \n\n- Possets - it just seems like a mess to me. BPAL has a massive catalog, but even I think it's slightly better than Possets\n\n- BPAL - sometimes it can be really hard to find the category you want. Like when the Lupers/Crimson Peak were up - the sidebar didn't have anywhere that could lead you to the Lupers/Crimson Peak and you had to do some weird loop on the website to get to the Lupers/Crimson Peak.

{"body": "What country are you in?\n\nI just finished working for a payment gateway in Canada, and I can corroborate that anything above 3.5-4% is very high. American Express can charge that much as a regular rate (usually around 3-3.5%) but Visa and Mastercard should be lower.\n\nThe industry is filled with 3rd parties that have a negotiated lower rate with the processor and make money by hiking up the percentage and making money on the processing of their clients. In Canada partners can get rates as low as 2.55% and resell the service upwards of 3.5% on the high end.\n\nTalking directly with the processor instead of a gateway or middle man such as woocommerce, shopify, basically anyone who is not a large bank lol. Popular processors in North America would be TD Bank, First Data, GlobalPay, Chase Paymentech, Vital / TSYS, Desjardin. You MIGHT have luck negotiating the rate down by talking directly to these providers, but be warned that their customer support is often lacking. You still must use a gateway to 'integrate' your site with woocommerce. \n\nYou kind of have to work backwards to see what Processors you can call upon to save some money. You have to find out from WooCommerce what gateways they support. They should be able to give you a list, like Authorize.net, braintree, stripe, Beanstream, etc. You then can contact those gateways to find out what Processors they support. Then you can contact those Processors to negotiate a lower discount rate (% fee). Some Processors DO act as gateways as well, but many processors just want to process the end payment and charge the discount rate and leave all of the integrating with other services to the gateway.\n\nProcessors: These are the top dogs, they are the banks who actually process the payments. They charge a discount rate by percentage of the sale and take that as their payment. They are integrated with the card providers directly (visa, mastercard, amex, etc). They prefer to just process payments and collect their fee, so they often have poor support, or rely on gateways and other providers to resell their service.\n\nGateways: They make their money by charging a transaction fee, such as $0.10 per transaction. Usually for both approved and declined transactions. If they do not charge any per transaction fee, then your discount rate is likely higher because they are getting a slice of that. Gateways are the most common resellers of credit card processing. \n\nService Providers \\ Carts: These are companies like woocommerce, shopify, recurly, volusion to name a few. They make a service that takes payments in some way that is tailored to specific business models to make taking payments easier, or provide better reporting, whatever your business might need. This is usually in a the form of a shopping cart or app, but other services like Recurly specialize in managing recurring payments. \nThey are the bottom level resellers and will have the highest rates because they are hiking up the costs that were already hiked up from the gateway usually. Even big companies like Volusion or Shopify who usually resell at the gateway level directly with the Processors will still inflate their rates.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR** - Educate yourself on how the payments industry works. For 'card no present' transactions (ecommerce), you will have to pay a discount rate (% fee) and a per transaction fee ($.10 / tx) most of the time. Negotiate with the Processor directly for a lower discount rate, then negotiate with the gateway provider for a lower per transaction fee. In order to configure woocommerce you will need your gateways account info, usually some account id and passcode. \n\nChain of command\n\nEnd customer --&gt; Website --&gt; WooCommerce --&gt; Gateway --&gt; Processor --&gt; Visa/Mastercard/Amex\n\n---\n\nSorry this is long, only took me a few moments to write, couldn't stop for some reason lol. Let me know if you have any other questions. I have helped a lot of people integrate their sites with 3rd party services, if I can help I will. \n", "id": "d6aqxq4", "subreddit": "startups", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh26", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1470768905, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4wxbaq", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1473310985, "author": "crispyfrybits", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_4wxbaq"}

If you're more of an advanced user and find yourself with a large catalog and potentially having wholesale customers, go with bigcommerce.\n\nIf shopify and bigcommerce cost too much for you, go with woocommerce, wordpress, or other sources. (I've heard mixed reviews of woocommerce, mostly troubles handling large traffic) The difference is, those cheaper ones are not like Bigcommerce or shopify, since stock themes and designs are poorly suited for successful online sales. To make those sites work well, you'll need to be able to dive into html to optimize them. While bigcommerce and shopify have free themes that look great and are highly functional off the bat. \n\nPersonally, I'm a huge fan of bigcommerce. The base price is higher, but the amount of built in tools is much greater (shopify has apps which greatly improve functionality, but you'll find yourself piling on paid apps left and right), and its generally more powerful. Not to mention, bigcommerce has recently released their new stencil themes, that blow any other theme on any platform clear out of the water, even the free ones. The only trouble is, the ability to customize html is limited for the stencil themes (last i knew, they have added support for that recently, I'm not sure) if that's an issue, you can still use the non-stencil themes (blueprint)\n\np.s.

I was paying around 20USD a month for wix.\n\n\n3) I was looking to branch out EndlessThrows from being a one deal a month offer to a full yoyo store featuring a deal of the month.

{"body": "Your article is very strange, I guess you're going for the controversial clickbait type headline? \nYou are very good at stating the obvious! Shopify doesn't generate traffic for you! Who ever said they did? This isn't a problem with shopify, as you state, it's a problem with the people who sign up thinking this way. Shopify does seem to get included in discussions about ebay, FBA etc, when in fact it is completely different than those. Those who go into it thinking this will learn quickly that traffic is not included with shopify like it is with ebay and Amazon. \n\nYou've got some errors in your merchant revenue calculation. You're assuming that shopify takes 3% of every sale. This is not the case. Most, if not all established stores are going to offer paypal as a solution, in which case shopify charges 0.5% or 1% of sales as a payment gateway. On our stores, over half of our business is done through paypal, so your calculation for a store like ours (a top 1% store) is going to be more like 1.525% (not 3%) when calculating average annual merchant revenue, which would bring it somewhat closer to $37572 per store. (however, even $19099 seems like an incredibly high number to me, based on how many hobby business are out there that have no clue how to drive traffic)\n\nAlso, shopify is probably very top heavy in regards to revenue. If you only looked at the top 10% of all stores on Shopify, I could safely say that they generate much more than the bottom 90% of stores. My best store's sales, averaged with 99 others that make $0.00 is double the revenue that you say the average store makes. Average sales is just a terrible factor to consider when choosing a platform, as it means nothing. Shopify is only as good as the person using it. My sales would be roughly the same on shopify, bigcommerce, or any other host. Shopify just does what they do well, and makes is simple for anyone. \n\n\n\n", "id": "d6djw41", "subreddit": "shopify", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sn78", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1470939613, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4x56sc", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1473350662, "author": "axejeff", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_4x56sc"}

{"body": "If by Woo you mean Woocommerce, I would like to paste a reply I made in another topic asking about WordPress vs. Shopify:\n\nWith WordPress, there are 1001 things that can easily break. Of course, the solution 90% of the time is very simple. The problem is, most people do not know those simple little solutions.\n\nOnce again, with WordPress things break. \n\nFor example, let's say you want a nifty little pop up box to show up that asks your visitors to sign up for your newsletter. You know that WordPress has tons of free plugins so you go find a free one. You install it and then what happens? It's not compatible with some other plugin you are using and some sort of functionality on your site breaks. \n\nOk, so maybe using free plugins aren't the best idea. You go find some paid plugin that you purchase. It works great but the author decides to stop supporting it ten months after you purchased it and now it's not compatible with the latest version of WordPress. Time to start all over again. \n\nOk, let's say you finally find a great plugin that you purchased and the author is completely committed to keeping it updated. Great! Oh wait, there is a security vulnerability in your plugin and some chump used a script to install malware on your site that shows users pop up ads of porn sites. What do you do then? Your cheap ass shared hosting won't help and you know nothing about cleaning up a hacked WordPress site. You either pay someone or spend twenty plus hours yourself trying to clean up your site only to have it hacked again because all you did was clean the files and not fix the problem. After all, how in the world would you know how the attacker accessed your site? You're not a professional in this area, you just want to sell some stuff. \n\nAnother example? Another example. Let's say you decide to go with WordPress. You find a nice looking theme over at themeforest and get your site set up. It looks fantastic and is working great! Two months later some stupid plugin that was bundled up with the theme stops working because it's not compatible with the latest version of WordPress. Maybe it's the drag and drop page builder that stopped working. Wonderful, now you can't edit or add any new pages because the page builder is broken. After hours of trying to figure out what's going on, you managed to get your theme updated and get the page builder plugin updated. Now you can finally make the changes you need to. \n\nNope. Too bad son, the theme author made a bunch of changes to the theme with the latest update and now half of your content is jacked up or not displaying at all. Time to spend another two days trying to get your site back to normal. \n\nYou might think those are far fetched examples and I am exaggerating but every example I have given has happened to myself or my clients. \n\nThe WordPress community likes to blab on about how user friendly WordPress is. It's not. If you want to set up an online store I highly suggest not using WordPress unless you hire a well regarded agency to build it for you. Shopify or any other online service that specializes in ecommerce would be a much better option.\n\nActually, have you looked into squarespace? I haven't personally used their ecommerce functionality but it might be worth looking into.\n", "id": "d6dvpx3", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1470961061, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4xamht", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1473355122, "author": "ohyeahthatsme", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_4xamht"}

Setup a Shopify page to handle incoming traffic. And to display product.\n2.  Create a $100 Facebook/Instagram marketing campaign. See how much traffic you get.\n3. On your Shopify page, mark all items as sold out. Don't sell anything. Don't pre-manufacture product for expected sales. Just test traffic and price points. \n4. Reach out to influencers/affiliates, offer them your product for free. If the sell it, or give it away - thats cool, they keep profit. You will do this as outreach and eat manufacturing costs.

{"body": "Hmm thanks for the reply. I guess I need to look at Shopify a little more closely. \n\nTo explain a little more about my needs, my business takes a LOT of pre-orders. When a customer places a pre-order, we only collect a deposit, generally about 10% of retail price but this varies by brand. So we need a system that allows us to collect the deposit, and then when the item comes in stock collect the remaining amount due including shipping. We usually don't know the weights/dims until we have the item in-hand, hence we need to edit the order for this. Also, some of these preorders are often over a year out, so many customers need a different shipping address by that time. To keep the customer experience easy, we need to keep the order number the same after the edit. Basically so everything matches up if we need to get to an order history.\n\nI did not see the \"Order Update\" app when looking at Shopify - that looks very promising. \n\nIf i remember correctly a HUGE issue with shopify is recording partial payments on the orders we import. Maybe we import them with the deposit as the whole order total, and then go in with order update and correct them later. It seems like order update allows orders to have a balance due, so this could work...\n\nAs for ebay, i did not look closely because the order editing seemed impossible. The main issue will be that I need the app to only list a quantity of one, and then after a sale, look and see if inventory is available and relist if the rules are met. Backorder-type items, ones which we do not keep on hand but readily buy from suppliers as sales come in, should just keep relisting until we stop it. \n\nA couple questions which maybe you know off-hand:\n\n1. Pre-order items require a different product template than in-stock. There needs to be sufficient language to indicate the deposit price is not the final price, and an ETA on the item. Does shopify allow multiple templates?\n\n2. Does Shopify save CC info and allow backend transactions to be created by admins? On pre-orders, the best scenario is that when the item comes in stock, we update the orders for final price and shipping, and then run the remaining amount due with saved CC info. I like that \"Order Update\" allows sending an email to collect payment, but that isn't the standard in our industry. And some customers are lazy with their payment.\n\nWhew.. sorry for the long post. \n\ntl;dr i will look more into Shopify for sure...", "id": "d6ep37c", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1471018490, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4x931d", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1473366178, "author": "AndyKrow", "edited": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d6e60wb"}

{"body": "There could be lots of reasons why people aren't purchasing, but I'll try to list a few in detail here with some suggestions for you.\n\n1. About Us Page: I still don't really know who you are from your about us page. It could use a lot more content here and I would start with company profiles of you and your father, so people can see the faces behind the brand. Just provides another level of trust in e-commerce. Also, I'd elaborate on your story about the business and how you started. And if you are catering to an English speaking market which it seems you are, I would correct the quote that sounds very choppy and grammatically incorrect (although it may be authentic translation, it loses credibility with an English speaking audience)\n2.  Redo the features page to be more compact and with more detail. Make it a little more graphically interesting. That's a great page to have and I like that you included other people's reviews or awards, but it could be better.\n3. Change your Buy It Now button to another, brighter color. It blends in too much with the rest of the site right now and isn't enticing me to click it.\n4. You have no product descriptions for your accessories. This is going to help not only to help people feel more comfortable when they know the details but also will help you get recognized in search results on Google.\n5. Your make it custom section is a great idea but you don't have any pictures or videos of examples. That's what I'd want to see before I purchase, what will my custom pick look like?\n6. Your Shipping Rates page is a bit confusing to look at. I would space it out. Also, try to provide shipping rates in US$ too. Also, you don't have how many days it takes to ship for customers in Italy.\n7. No FAQ page. Sometimes customers want to get an answer to their questions without contacting. This will help you retain customers on the site longer. And again, it's good for search results because it is likely to contain long-tail keywords.\n\nThat's my brief analysis.

I'd spruce it up with some pictures and possibly the story about you as the owner, why you created the company and a picture of you (creates trust for the buyer). \n3. Your product photos are awesome! But your product pages could still improve with a product description. This helps create unique on-page content that will not only help buyers become convinced to purchase your product, but also help you get noticed in search results by search engines.\n4. Starting a blog on the site about pets and pet products could be a really great way to bring in traffic and create trust showing that you are knowledgeable in the field.\n5. Once you have customers (or if you already do) put in a customer reviews section for product pages. These reviews help customers make informed decisions and again are great pieces of content for search engines to pick up.\n\n\nNot exactly ecommerce site related, but I'd focus your attention on Instagram for social media right now as your engagement per post is amazing for 170~ followers.

We eventually if we were going to get big become a partnership so in the mean time we just acted as one. Anyways I just got out of highschool and he sent me 400 dollars to buy an apartment saying that we got a sale, and that I could use this money for my apartment. I did not know this but he had spent alot of money on a laptop and hunting or fishing knife. Anyways it turned out that, he didn't have enough money to send or give back the customers money, he only had 660. I am really worried because I am pretty sure my friend did a crime, but I also realized since it is his name and bank on shopify, wouldn't he get in trouble? And to add on to that I didn't realize that he committed a crime up until now. Will I get in trouble, I freakin hope I won't because I have never done a crime of any sort and did not realize that this guy did such a thing.

{"body": "Hey Adam,\n\nI'm 19 and currently run 3 online businesses of mine. One is an online influencer marketing company, another one is a web design/development business and my last one is selling paddle boards online.\n\nHaving started some of these businesses as early as when I was 13, I hope I can help you out with your question!\n\nMy most relevant experience is obviously the paddle boarding business.\nMy first tip would be, never underestimate yourself in terms of age. If anything, from my experiences the younger you are the better of a chance you have in people noticing you.\n\nA 30 year old running a company won't be newsworthy but a 13 year old running a company is.\nLeverage that. Network and show proof of why your age isn't a deciding factor in your entrepreneurial success.\n\nNow, as to the business.\nIt's good that you have a passion, that's the number one requirement!\nI'd suggest learn some basic HTML and CSS programming. Not only does it not take that long to understand the basics but you will also save A LOT of money on web development costs in the future.\nWhich brings us to the next step. Since you're an online company, make sure your online presence is noteworthy. If you owned a physical shop, you wouldn't want it looking trashed would you?\nAn online business is exactly the same. Make sure your website is clean, your links work, your website has good content, you have support for your customers in a timely fashion and just the general basics.\nPut yourself in the customers shoes. Why would they buy from you? Differentiate yourself!\n\nIf you don't know much coding, Squarespace is a good start for your website. If you know some, Wordpress and shopify are good alternatives.\n\nNext, I'm assuming you don't have storage space. No big deal. \nRead into dropshipping because that's exactly what your business model will be.\nFind reliable suppliers from places such as AliExpress and ask if they do dropshipping. \n\nFrom there that's pretty much it. The rest are just details.\n\nAnything that I missed or you would like to ask, feel free to comment away!\n\nCheers, hope I was able to help :)\nFrom a fellow young entrepreneur ", "id": "d6iz3xq", "subreddit": "Entrepreneurship", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhww", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1471302967, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4xvdaf", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1473423928, "author": "potatoechippets", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_4xvdaf"}

We have all been stretched a little thin in an effort to get our new machine up and running.  The issues referred to in the. 80% arms review and mad maniac on YouTube have been addressed.  These issues included safety hole miss alignment which was due to a spot drill that had broken and was not making contact with the part causing the drill to walk.  The beaver tail issue was an oversight on adjusting an offset  so the 3D portion near the buttstock would match up better with the standard DPMS pistol grip, and in doing this it caused the beaver tail to not fit properly.  The dowel pin and set screw are included with every lower receiver, and we now broach our magwells which have eliminated the fitting issues we were running into.  We get our material through ThyssenKrupp from the Kaiser mill with certified paperwork for 7075 T6, so if it is not, that would be news to us.  Here at M1 Machining we put a lot of pride and energy into making the highest quality part at competence pricing and we sincerely appreciate the feedback we receive.  We have fallen down in the past, but we have worked with every one of those customers to resolve their concerns, and we truly try to do the right thing.  Some folks have been more receptive to this than others.  We appreciate you giving us the opportunity to tell out side of the story and giving us a chance to earn your business.  I hope I have answered your questions, but if I missed anything please let me know.  Thank you for supporting M1 Machining and we look forward to hearing from you.\n\nMike Garcia\n844 M1 BUILT (612.8458)\nCustomerService@M1Machining.com\nTeam M1\n\nOn Aug 9, 2016, at 11:15 PM, M1 Machining (Shopify) &lt;mailer@shopify.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nYeah a week to reply...

I would hide the link until you have it going.  \n\n - Buy some social media followers on Fiverr - right now your social media pages are working against you by saying you are either brand new or you simply don't engage your audience.  Buy some followers to improve your numbers and post like crazy.  \n\n - No shipping times.  How long will it take my product to ship or get to me?  I would want to know.  \n\n - Lastly (and this is meant with all good intentions), put some more work into your design - I get the minimalist look, but it really does look like it was put together in only a few days time, and that causes me some concern.  Perhaps get someone on fiverr to get you some quality logos, artwork, or to just share some design ideas with you.  \n\nOverall an excellent start here, but you need some work if you expect some sales.

{"body": "&gt; Best website for super-customizing themes?\n\nAny developer worth his salt will be able to \"super-customize\" the theme.

Your business goals and constraints will determine the tools you'll want to use to implement the site.\n\nFrom the looks of it, you're selling an e-book, so Shopify would be more than sufficient.\n\n&gt; The only thing is, I have a VERY specific look I want the website to have. I think a website looking great is absolutely key for it to be a winner.\n\nCompletely agree with you here. Do you have mockups of said specific look?\n\n&gt; What's the best e-commerce platform to use for this?\n\nSo, it seems that your main concern is the *customizability* of the *look* of the site. The style of the site is customizable to your heart's content, you just have to find the right developer to do it.\n\nIf you're talking about customizing the site yourself, however, then it's customizability will be dictated by your current ability, willingness to learn, and time. Most platforms have a visual editor that allows you to customize the site style without the need for a developer, but there are limitations within them.\n\nFrom what I've gathered, you'll probably want to stick to Shopify. Woocommerce and Squarespace would also probably work. For the sake of what you're looking to do, your friend was correct in recommending Shopify.\n\n&gt; Also it needs to have mobile functionality as well as PC screen functionality.\n\nAny modern theme (you'll be able to use free themes, or purchase one that you may then customize to your liking) will be built to be mobile responsive; so you'll have the mobile, tablet, and PC screen functionality that you're looking for.\n\nPerhaps \n\n**tl;dr:** Any platform you choose will be customizable, and have the features you're looking for. However, if you're looking for ultimate customizability, you'll probably need to hire a developer to execute your vision exactly.  \n\nMy suggestion? Go try Shopify and sign up for a trial, see if you can customize it to your liking, and from there you'll learn whether you need to hire a developer or purchase a theme.

{"id": "d6n3wvj", "body": "You mentioned that you're not trying to reinvent the wheel, but it kinda seems like it? What features are you planning on adding to this POS system that aren't already available in one of the existing solutions?\n\n&gt;I am building the system for another couple of restaurants he is working on and I feel it necessary to have a credit card processing system that abides by a few specifications. 2.) Obviously PCI compliance\n\nPCI compliance is multi-faceted. The business is responsible for being PCI compliant; the processor may or may not check if they are/validate it. Notably for you, Visa isn't thrilled with the security from third party POS vendors/installers, which partly accounts for why they're going to start requiring validation in January for all businesses. (Article we wrote here: ---LINK---\n\n&gt;3.) The ability to negotiate rates of processing fees down to 2.0% for AMEX (upfront to after a term, mainly I need to know that it is possible period)\n\nMmm, probably not. 2% for Amex is pretty low, though they don't publish their official table of fees for OptBlue. Additionally, we're in a weird point with Amex - they rolled out a new, lower cost pricing model, but a lot of business don't know that, which has allowed a lot of processors to keep business' pricing at the higher 3.5% people are used to. Until more people are aware of that money grab, processors aren't likely to willingly surrender their high Amex markup.\n\nMerchants that process more than $1million/year in Amex alone need to have a direct account with Amex - they may be able to negotiate better.\n\n&gt;Stripe is my main hope at this point, however, Stripe doesn't appear to have a good reputation in the customer service world, and the last thing I need is to have them reserve the financials for a company I am working with, and force them out of business (as I have read they have done)\n\nStripe doesn't have phone support, which gets annoying for some businesses. Also, their starting rates are 2.9% + 30 cents for online transactions, which is all they personally enable, though they may negotiate for higher volume businesses. They have options for developers to create other solutions through Cardflight, but as for POS systems, they have a partnership with Shopify POS already. Have you spoken with anyone there about them supporting your system?\n\nAlso, Stripe isn't a processor. They're an aggregator.\n\nIf you want to have the most options, you should see if you can get supported by one of the legit backend processors (First Data, TSYS, Elavon, Chase Paymentech, Global Payments, Heartland, Vantiv/NPC, or Worldpay) because then any of the payment companies that process through them could potentially support your POS system.\n\nLastly, any processing company can hold funds. It's up to the merchant to limit the likelihood of that, through communication with the processor and most importantly, abiding by the processing agreement.", "subreddit": "pointofsale", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2xnx0", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1471552104, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4yaxfy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "CardFellow", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1473479303, "parent_id": "t3_4yaxfy"}

{"body": "I won't claim to be a branding expert, but can share with you a few things I'm learning as I'm going through this \"brand building\" process on one of my own ecommerce shops: I started a brand new fitness brand selling just jump ropes &amp; battle ropes for crossfit. Initially I launched the products on Amazon. Shortly after I discovered they would sell on Amazon I set up a shopify site and listed the products to see if I could see a few that way. I did zero ppc, or advertising of any kind. I also put zero effort into social media. However, I did \"Brand\" the heck out of my Amazon listing in the title, language, words, etc. I also hired a company to make some nice videos and do some great product photography (both studio and action). And I put my logo everywhere possible on the product packaging, product, etc. Here's what I've seen: I launched in April. \n*April - $125 in website sales. \n*May - $300\n*June - $1.1k\n*July - $2.8k\n*Aug (so far) - $3k\nSo revenue via my website is doubling every month. As far as I can tell, it's almost entirely based off of branding via Amazon (i.e. people see my amazon listings or purchase some of the products via amazon coming to my site). I get some organic traffic from the video content I created, but very little. It appears to me that my efforts as a very small shop in branding will be mostly wasted in trying to advertise and invest into social media for \"building my brand.\" Rather, the best thing I can do is try to get my products in as many hands as possible via existing sales channels that I don't have to kill myself to get traffic to. As that happens, my \"brand\" is growing organically. \nI'll try to follow up in a couple months to let you know if my brand is still growing this way. My next steps are to get my products onto other channels like Jet.com, etc.\n\n", "id": "d6nfgvi", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1471568075, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4ydcvd", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1473483300, "author": "jordan_Lind", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_4ydcvd"}

{"body": "I feel your pain! I have been trying to get my products in front of people for over a year. I agree with you in that you should be able to pick something up and be passionate about what you are selling. But, you also need product validation so you don't spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on something that won't sell.\n\nA good tip that I learned recently for product validation: start a shopify shop. You get a 14 day free trial, so make the most of it. Get your t shirt designs in the shop (assuming you can post renders of the shirts for free or next to nothing). Search for the google adwords coupon, and setup an adwords campaign that sends people straight to your shopify shop. The coupon gives you $75 worth of free advertising, which in the t shirt business could end up in quite a few views.\n\nIf your t shirts are a hit, people will buy. If not, then you have a decent idea of where to go with it. There is a lot more to this like conversion rates and shop setups, but if you want to get a feel for your design, that is where I would start. Good luck!

{"body": "That sounds like a mess. Yeah it's not my money but something like that to me sounds like a sunk cost on some level. Really sounds like you have a problem where you want a system that is hands off, but yet need a very custom hands on solution for the shopping cart.\n\nI'm not sure what the requirements are with the shopping cart or how it operates so that's a big question mark there. You probably wouldn't be able to integrate that with something like Shopify or BigCommerce (which would be the most hands off platforms). I worked on the new BigCommerce Stencil system before it launched and as of March 2016 it was still locked to developers to have the ability to extend features like that. I'm not sure where Shopify is now with regards to extending and adding new custom features. You might be looking at having to use Magento or a custom built solution if it's a 100% requirement to keep that shopping cart.\n\nI guess if Shopify or BigCommerce, or another all-in-one hosted platform offered a service where you could integrate only the shopping cart piece that would be the best solution. That would require the vendor itself to offer you a custom development solution for an extra cost, or have an environment where you could hire a developer to create just that extra piece.

In fact, DJango for example has a **spaceless** tag that I use. ---LINK---  . But I don't try to use it on every line to minify my project.

I combine all my CSS into 1 file and minify that, and combine all my JS into 1 file and minify that.

{"body": "Thank you!  The industry has been tremendously accepting of us, and we hope we've made a positive impact so far.\n\nYou have a lot of questions, so please forgive me if I skip a couple.\n\n- Shopify Payments.  Tried it, got banned almost immediately.  As you may know, our industry (tobacco products) is restricted.  Seek alternative payment processors.\n\n- Bitpay was incredibly easy to integrate.  Shopify has them as a alternative payment method, so just follow the instructions.  Takes about 30 mins.\n\n- I learned to code when I was 13, almost entirely self taught, and took a couple classes for it in school formally.  I know about 10-12 different programming languages at this point.  I know that seems like a lot, but the learning curve for new languages significantly eases as you learn the fundamentals of all computers.\n\n- Our experience with overseas factories has been mixed.  There is a issue with trust a lot of the times.  Are you sure they won't leak your designs?  Even if they \"promised\"?  There's nothing to hold overseas manufacturers accountable.  You certainly can't pursue them within USA law.  I do visit them semi-frequently.  I have family in China, and I speak fluent Mandarin.\n\n- Haha, interesting!  Did we meet at an industry event?  Darby and I are indeed in an open relationship.  We've been dating since before this company started, and it's certainly had it's pros and cons.  At the end of the day, I have a tremendous amount of trust and respect for my partner (both in business and in our relationship) which I think doing this whole venture has strengthened.  On the cons side, it's not a typical relationship.  We've had to adapt our personal lives to focus on the business.  Cuts out a lot of time for social activities, friends, etc.  There are a lot of everyday job stresses, and we bear them together.  Can be trying at times.\n\n- I can't speak for how we'll feel in the future, but right now we are not considering an exit in the industry.  We love the people, the culture, and the products we promote.\n\n- As you know, it's an immature industry, so artists of all kinds can be difficult to deal with.  A lot of our industry hasn't even digitalized their inventory yet, or still stick to invoices on notepads scanned and emailed over.  We try to only work with brands and vendors that have their shit together.  Makes life a lot easier in the long run.\n\n- Sean", "id": "d6pd44l", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1471701205, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4ym2f3", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1473506545, "author": "smokecartel", "edited": false, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t1_d6p8d2r"}

Why limit yourself to just WP? \n\nDid you read a post recently on Entrepreneur or Startup about a guy who bought a Shopify plugin (could be WordPress, cant remember) that pops up a notification whenever someone other than you purchased something on the site?

{"body": "There's never been better tools for people to self-direct and build their own web site. They have options like SquareSpace and Wix. Want to sell something online? Shopify makes it easy to get started. Blog? WordPress.com with a custom theme and they're off and running. All of these have low barrier to entry, and a low initial cost (~$10/month or $50 for a theme). \n\nOr, in other words, in today's market $200 is a reasonable price to pay for a web site. \n\n&gt; I'm sure some of you will say \"Don't work with those people,\" - and I understand. But it's not easy considering practically everybody I'm running into has this kind of mindset.\n\nYou're a couple of months into your freelance web dev career. You're going to run into the low-end of the market a lot because a) you're just starting out and building up your personal network and b) low-end customers are ubiquitous and common. \n\nThink in terms of market segments: On the low-end there's probably 10 million businesses in the U.S. and Canada who would pay $200 for a web site. Mid-level maybe 1-2 million who would pay $2,000. High end: perhaps a few hundred thousand who would pay $10,000 or more. (Pulling these numbers out my butt, but I think you get the idea). \n\nAdvice like \"Don't work with these people\" is simply acknowledging the reality of the market. The competition on the low-end is saturated with developers from emerging nations where $200 is an excellent full-time wage. It's also saturated with highly capitalized companies that have successfully productized web development services. As a solo freelancer it's a very tough market segment to compete in. Oftentimes the only winning move here is to not play the game. \n\n(Now, if you have a great idea for a web service that will blow SquareSpace and Shopify out of the water, then go for it! But this is /r/freelance not /r/entrepreneur) \n\nHere's an article that deals with some of the ideas around setting your pricing and defining your market: [\"We don't get out of bed for less than $10,000 per day.\"]---LINK---\n\nThe meat of the article is about half-way through. And while I don't agree with everything written the following quotes resonate with my own experience:  \n\n&gt; Your response reminded me of how I moved from a $20/hr web developer to a $120/hr web developer in about 12 months simply by increasing my rate at every contract bid I put out .... I started making 600% more money by asking for more .... I never lost a contract due to this, it was purely a mental barrier.\n\n&gt; But as soon as you need money - and people know - you're hosed.\n\nIt's glib to say \"if you want to make more money just start charging $100/hr\". There's no magic secret to reveal or special hourly rate to hit. Yes you're a freelancer - but first and foremost you're running a business, even if it's a solo endeavour. So you're going to need a business plan. Read the advice in this thread and consider it carefully. Come up with a strategy for the market segment you want to compete in, and set some goals. I'm preaching to myself now but hopefully you'll find some of it useful.

My best guess is that your code is currently set up like this:\n\n    {% if description_above %}\n        {{ product.description }}\n        &lt;div&gt;Shipping info&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;button&gt;Add to Cart&lt;/button&gt;\n    {% else %}\n        &lt;button&gt;Add to Cart&lt;/button&gt;\n        {{ product.description }}\n    {% endif %}\nIn that situation, if the settings are telling the code to show the descriptions below, your shipping info isn't actually going to show. You'll need to add in your shipping info twice, so that is can show up regardless of the \"below\" or \"above\" setting.

{"id": "d6u1gvb", "body": "wow! I have followed your story from the shopify blogs its great to see you on this subreddit. I recently sold my shopify store and the guy that has taken it over has revamped it and is doing well with it! I felt no regrets selling it, but by far the strategy behind taking a business and improving it is quite fascinating to me. \n\nThe biggest thing of your story that gets me is not the amount of money your making but what your plan of action was from Day 1 ---&gt;Day 2 --&gt; Day 3, how much you got done compared to what you wanted, pitfalls, successes, breakthroughs. Additionally, the negotiation process behind the acquisition must of been a great learning experience. I am engineer by education most of my work is design/project management and execution and operations. This has always been where my work ethic stems from.\n\nGrowing up I've always worked in sales and now that my normal job is going well, i want to take my skills and start my own online business/brand. I would of loved to join a startup but you dont really have many of those in my city(edmonton). After my shopify store did well it validated my abilities as something i could do full time if put the time into it. So i have been planning my next \"side\" project in hopes that it becomes my full time project. I learned tons from my first store i am eager to start. i went on a little vacation after my store sold and then had to take a trip to meet the gfs family. over the break though I got my domains and social media accounts started, website hosted and am just designing my logo, and am eager to start.\n\nI think will go much smoother however ill be using wordpress and not shopify so this is an area that is new to me. Shopify's platform is great, wordpress will be whats foreign. I guess the hardest thing is that I've always been a one man show. My one thought after selling my store was i wish i knew what i knew now when i started the store, or i wish i had someone who could tell me what to do. Hope that makes sense\n\nI have that feeling this time around as well.

The recruiters are sharks looking for the most qualified candidates so they can make their condition- hr departments that i've gone through don't know tech so just look for keywords.\n\nStill looking for better employment, just making landing pages at work and maintaining wp sites for link synergy.\n\nSome say bootcamps are the way to go, imho if you just work on personal projects, go to meetups, and get stuff done you'll have projects to show at interviews. It's a chicken and egg situation though, where I'm at they want a full-stack or senior level person for a junior position so i'm having some trouble.\n\nAlso consider this, they've got meetups here every wednesday with some group or another.

{"body": "Craigslist VS 99designs (my experience)\n\nI'll try to keep this as brief as possible. \n\nTwo months ago I went on Craigslist looking for someone to create a shopify theme and logo for 600. I started my search on Craigslist and after a few days I found a very knowledgeable designer. He showed me an extensive portfolio and assured me he was the person for the job. I was sold. I sent over 400 to start and gave him the specs. After payment was made communication practically stopped. To make a long story short; after a month of BS all I had was a crappy logo and a layout for a website. It was so bad that I asked for a full refund through PayPal and got it. \n\nAfter wiping the sweat from my forehead (because I almost lost 400 dollars) I decided to try 99designs. I'll never use anything else ever again. I spent 499 and had over 25 designs submitted to me. Within 6 days I had the design I wanted and a website. Yes, they use Jimdo for the web design but that's ok for the price. You can view the work at ---LINK---\n\nTIPS: \nBe very descriptive when you start your contest. \nAlso, ask support to make your contest blind. This just means that no one can see the deigns except for you. This promotes originality. Guarantee your contest. It's let's all the designers know you're serious and committed. Finally, you'll find a designer that you like working with through this experience. Glad I chose 99designs. \n\nOH AND THE 24/7 customer service is what really got me. I'd have questions at 3am and there would always be someone to chat with. \n\nNo, I'm not affiliated with this service. I'm just happy that I found something that worked.

{"body": "It really depends.  Some brands and product categories are not available through Amazon or eBay for various reasons, so of course they sell better on 1st party sites.  I was selling a type of product that was already popular on Amazon/eBay, but under a no-name brand, so naturally people trusted Amazon more.  This was also a few years ago, my cart and checkout weren't that great, etc.  \n\nThe best place to sell is definitely your own site because you save 10-20% in commission!  However, most shopping is taking place on big marketplaces, so it's hard to capture the traffic in the first place. SEO and PPC are your friend, but are both time-consuming and expensive. \n\nYou can definitely make sales on Shopify (or another cart) and 95% is probably a lot higher than most people experience, that was just my personal ratio back in the day.  I don't know the actual ratio off the top of my head.  Ideally you sell on all the big marketplaces and strive to get more sales on your 1st-party site to get more profit over time.  \n\nBut yeah long story short, people shop on amazon a lot.  If they find what they want on Amazon they don't look elsewhere.  So it's fairly essential to be on amazon if your competition is.

{"id": "d6w3eq8", "body": "Hey Magicspud!\n\nHaving been an Amazon seller myself, I know the frustration you must feel with using their system - the fees, the inventory control, and everything in between. Your frustrations must be substantial enough to justify you wanting to leave them.\n\nBut if you are a big seller on their platform and are able to manage it, then getting your own website for your store could be an easier undertaking than you think. Getting traffic to your website will also be easier than you think especially if you already have a good customer list to work with.\n\nSince you are selling on Amazon already with great success, I'm going to make some assumptions here:\n- That you are branding your own store within the Amazon marketplace (i.e. Bob's Place, etc.)\n- That you are selling niche products at a steady rate\n- That you are using their Fulfillment By Amazon service\n\nBased on these assumptions, here's a good starting point for you to begin building your own store, with your own brand, selling the same products, and potentially to the same audience.\n\n1) Get a domain name - easy and extremely cheap. Brand it to your current Amazon store name if available, that way your current customers will already be familiar. Having their trust through selling with Amazon can work in your favor here.\n\n2) Since you are a big seller already, you must be selling niche products that are in demand. Use this as leverage to rank high on search engines by using appropriate keywords for your niche. Being a big seller also means you already are an authority in that particular niche and selling on Amazon is just a plus because of the trust they already have with customers. Transferring that authority over to your own website could be as easy as mentioning \"as seen on Amazon\" within your marketing campaigns and referencing your own store. *Shameless Self-Promotion is your friend!*\n\n3) If you are currently using Fulfillment by Amazon and are having them package everything for you, include inserts or marketing material within each shipment with your website on said material. Having invoices, or inserts, with your website printed on it will help with retaining some of your current customers. If you are packaging the products yourself, consider getting a stack of business cards printed with your information on them - brand name, store website, possible promo code to catch their interest, etc. Business cards are dirt cheap! $9.99 for a stack of 250 from Vistaprint, but consider perhaps flyers or other promotional material that can help with putting your brand first before Amazon's.\n\nOf course, all of this requires your own website with a shopping cart solution that provides the same functionality as Amazon so finding the right system will be key for your business.\n\nHere are some solutions for that:\n\n1) Shopify - Integrates well and is very user friendly. Highly trusted and accepts Amazon payments so your current customers will find it easier to just transfer buy from your own store.\n\n2) Ecwid.com - Their free shopping cart solution is great for experimenting with your own store that's separate from Amazon. They have a free forever plan that integrates well with Facebook with more features available for paid plans. Try setting up a store and testing it out before making the big move.\n\nEither way, having your own website will not hurt your efforts especially if you are set in leaving the Amazon platform. Getting a domain name is extremely cheap and hosting is equally cheap, a lot less than your Amazon fees I'm sure, and are just plain necessary when establishing your own brand.\n\nI hope this helps with your efforts to break away from Amazon and if you have any questions, you can contact me via my website: ---LINK---\n\nBest regards!\n-J.Navarro", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1472135251, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4zg343", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1473594387, "author": "jnavarrollc", "edited": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_4zg343"}

I'm not gonna say my sites are awesome but you want to make the landing page impressive or at least coherent visually.

Shopify makes this extremely easy via apps and can gain the interest of your current buyers, giving them more incentive to keep coming back. With some loyalty programs you can even turn the same customers into affiliates, allowing them to do some marketing on your behalf - all for a small commission of course. \n\nBut consider the impact that could have on your brick and mortar business, especially with the holidays creeping up quickly upon us.

I believe filing a chargeback for this situation is not what a card/bank's chargeback system is for, so if Etsy handles them similarly, she may be blowing smoke (it may also be the case that she has to pay a fee for it, which might deter her from starting the process at all).

It's something like just copying the link and putting it in your &lt;head&gt; tags.\n\nYeah you'll have to use facebook ads, which in my opinion is the easiest and best way to validate. Sure AdWords might be better for long-term, but inbound marketing is slower in general for validation because they first have to search for the product.

{"id": "d70hce6", "body": "1. Wordpress is a Content Management System (CMS). It is the most popular of many (others include Joomla, Drupal, MODX and many more).\n\nCMSs came about out of the need to allow clients (non-coders) to update, edit, delete or add a site's content without getting into the nitty-gritty of the code. Usually, there is a 'back end' (sometimes called Administration or Manager section, depending on the CMS) that has a pre-designed interface that allows clients to manager their site.\n\nCMSs also allow designers to make sites faster as it helps organise their code and have a number of pre-built features and plugins you'll use often.\n\nMost Web Designers end up building 'Themes' or 'Templates' for these CMSs, then adding further functionality (eg: forms) by using downloadable plugins or creating their own.\n\n2.Ruby on Rails is a web application framework. It does a lot of the backend, server side stuff. I've not used it, so I can't help you much beyond that.\n\n3.It's up to you how and if you want to use Bootstrap. I find it's just very useful for building device responsive sites. Fundamentally, it's just a list of pre-written CSS classes (and JavaScript) you might have created anyway - why reinvent the wheel? ink.sapo.pt is similar example.\n\n4.You could build this in straight HTML and CSS if you wanted to. But heres what I would do:\n\n * Install Wordpress on your server (plenty of tutorials out there, pretty easy).\n * Learn how to create your own WP theme with HTML and CSS (again, plenty of tutorials). Bootstrap is optional here.\n * Create the pages in you mentioned via Wordpresses admin area.\n * Add any plugins you might want (like a contact form). Remember to read their instructions and manuals.\n * Now, shoping is a little more complicated. There are plugins for that for WP but I should let someone else tell you more about it. I've never liked them and tend to go for a proper e-commerce CMS like Shopify or Magento.\n * QA and publish your site.\n\nIn this case the code used is HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL.

I saw every possible type of site made in wordpress and i can tell you that if it wasn't a blog / presentation site, it was going to fail sooner or later. \n\nThe main problem i encountered was with the plugins. Every time a new version was released, i also had to update it on our sites. Some of them went trough with no problems, but others weren't compatible. Some developers released new versions as soon as a new wp-core was released, others didn't. It was like playing the roulette when maintenance was due :D. Backupbuddy saved my ass so many times... \n\nUpdating the theme (or the plugins included with it) is usually a huge pain.\n\nIf we were to ignore the \"up-to-date\" thingy, which is generally a bad ideea, especially on wordpress (check [this]---LINK---, other problems were prone to appear. From time to time, a database cleanup is necesarry, otherwise it slows the website down. \n\nWordpress is on top of the list when it comes to bots (spam, scanning for vulenerabilities, hacks, etc.). So you always had to take some extra steps regarding security. \n\nWhen i discovered shopify, it was like the holly grail for me. I'm really impressed by how easy it is do develop on it and how easy it is for my clients to manage their site on their own after my job is done.

{"body": "This isn't exactly a \"horror\" story per some of the ones here (the major financial rip offs, etc.), and I've never gone into any detail about it, but why not? I've tried three times to build a business and all three failed with some kind of impact. The first two failures cost me tens of thousands of dollars, and a hundred thousand in worthless notes, but the last one, though, that was a real personal killer.\n\nIn short, one failed because a partner was running a ponzi scheme on the side and the other failed because my partner just couldn't do what she needed to do. \n\nThis taught me that \"trust\" is two things - integrity and competence. If you're missing either, then trust is broken and you need to gtfo. The ponzi guy had the ability, but no integrity; the 2nd partner had all the integrity in the world, but was woefully incompetent. The third business ended up failing me on both accounts. It was the business I created with my father.\n\nA little about my father - he was an entrepreneur his entire life - starting a number of companies. As he got older though, his industry collapsed under the rise of the internet, and he didn't have a good exit strategy. This basically meant in his old age (70's) he still had to work for income. Me, on the other hand, always desired to start something, but could never take full leap out of a stable job/ source of income. People ultimately relied on me, my family being no exception, and I couldn't take such a risk. So everything was done while still working a full time, demanding career.\n\nAnyway, without going into much detail, my father and brother came up with a way to offer a much cheaper alternative to a popular medical focused product. This idea would have targeted a much more frugal market with a near similar, in some cases superior, product that was low(er) tech. At this point (having learned his lesson in the past) my brother parted ways on building the idea into a business. I didn't heed his warning. My father tried to bring in another partner just to create the website in exchange for 25% of the company. The guy was a fuckin' loser and did a shit shit shit job. So, my father approached me.\n\nRecognizing his economic situation and that, well, he needed something to do - I decided to build the company with him. The 25% really meant nothing, it more about doing something and something for him and something for myself.\n\nBut it was more than the website - in the end, I did **everything**. I literally made the product real, I handled designing it, I handled logistics, I handled figuring out a simple production process, I discovered the product's limitations and defined ways to still be successful with it, I handled researching the competition, researching medical laws, researching &amp; understanding medical terms which drove the product, I created the advertisements, pamphlets, website ads, graphics, I crafted all legal and copyrighting, worked out a HIPAA strategy, figured out taxes, created content &amp; wording, setup Paypal and all hosting accounts, I built security rules, etc. I then built the website - TWICE - including creating code that I'd argue is patentable - I've still yet to see it on other sites - and organized all necessary software. At it's core, this wasn't a product I could just shopify. Each unit was custom made and I figured out how to do it programmatically - including the incorporation of images, text, and special shapes. All for him, all for us. All while working a full career and the occasional home renovation.\n\nI would go weeks with little sleep. I did countless hours of testing, market research, prototyping, organizing. In the end, it was literally turn key. I put the damn thing together so well, I could just hand it to someone to run - just add \"selling\" and you're good to go. At this point unit costs were in the cents and you'd turn a full profit moving just a few hundred units (costs were only ~$3000 for equipment, legal creation of the LLC, and hosting). It wasn't a huge thing, but it was REAL. \n\nWhat did he do during this time? Nag. Nag that it wasn't coming along fast enough. Complain about me getting it done. Complain about the most insane old-man out of touch with technology things (which I then turned into a way to improve usability for an elderly market). At times we tried to outsource the work when things took too long - and each time the potential vendors would either bail because they fully grasped what was needed and it was way out of their grasp or positioned themselves to charge him out his asshole without delivering what he actually needed. Seeing how little help he was getting, I dove back in, revamped the site and put together step-by-step instructions on how to produce.\n\nAfter all that - we were ready. I was troubled (a bit too strong of a word, really) when it turned out he really didn't do much on his end. He didn't really sell the idea. Only spoke to a few distributors. He'd always be waiting for something to get going. And each time, I'd deliver it. At times my mother would get involved to help out - but most of what she did was out of her abilities, and I'd pull another all nighter to do it right. My brother also got involved on occasion, but he knew better than to invest too much (and even with his warnings I didn't see it going as south as it did). My girlfriend even pitched in. Everyone contributed time and effort - except him. Don't get me wrong, he put up 2/3rds of the actual cash - which was only $2000 - but I've done the math, and besides the $1000 I put in, I'd have created over $35K in effort (est. if you outsourced each part). \n\nBut it didn't matter - it was done, so it's time to get it to market. I called him and said, \n\"Ok, we're ready to go. Let's talk about ownership\". \nHe replies, \"Why do you want to talk about that? What, my word isn't good enough for you?\" \n\"Ha ha - funny dad. I'm just thinking we should get something in writing as a record in case something happens. Besides, 25% doesn't represent my total efforts so let's get something on file.\" \nHe responded, \"25%? I don't remember saying that...\"\n\n*What was that about your word not being good enough?*\n\nSo, nervously, we met at a diner. I was there to give him the production equipment, other materials, and discuss what compensation looks like now that he can do his part and sell the damn thing.\n\nAnd it went to shit. \n\n\"Why should I even give you 1%?!\" \"This is a thing of value, I can't just give it away!\" \"How's about I give you, say, a couple bucks for each unit we sell?\" \"Well, if I give you ownership, you could, you know, sell it to someone else!\" \"Well if you own anything, then, uh, you can only sell it to me.\" \"If I sell it, you can get a cut, AFTER I've covered all of my costs.\" (his \"costs\" included $3 grand he put in the bank for the company and every fee associated with that setting up the bank account) \"How dare you! After everything I've done for you growing up! This is how you thank your old man!!\"\n\nI'm a man in his early 30's at this point. And I had to bite my tongue to keep from crying publicly in a diner.\n\nAfter it dawned on me that he is, for all empirical tests and observations, a fucking asshole, I stiffened my lip. \n\"Ok, look, I created this. I created ALL of this. No one else did that - I did. Let's agree to 50/50 and move on.\" \n\"You mean I have to clear any decisions with you? No way, too much of a headache,\" he responded.\n\"Fine\", I said, \"51/49 you\". \nSo he hems and haws, \"I'm not sure... let me think about it.\" And packs up his stuff, pays for lunch, and heads home.\n\nIn my mind I know that legally, it's all mine. By default I owned all creative material, I paid for everything except the production equipment. In the end, all he really had was a hollow LLC.\n\nI was so disgusted, but we ultimately agreed on a cut with each sale. And, to his chagrin, I deferred any proceeds discussion if he sold the company to when we had a firm offer in hand. I think he put it together that his \"company\" was a bit of equipment and an annual EIN bill.\n\nI still gave him everything. I still managed to show him HOW to make the products. I could monitor the sales. It wouldn't sneak past me. And then... he just stopped.\n\nHe's been aging. And with it, basic ability gaps became apparent. He didn't remember how to check the email for sales. He struggled mightily to generate a single production unit. He tried to recruit his wife, but that didn't work, she was just as unable to wrap her head around it. In the end, my mother picked up production for my sake - she thought I should see something for it. I couldn't bring myself to look at the company without disgust. Besides, I had a full time job on my hands to worry about. \n\nBut - with no active advertising, you get no sales. So it sits. The site is still active, and I'd check the emails on occasion praying that no one placed an order because it wasn't about to get filled any time soon. Today the SSL certs have expired so the site comes up as being super shady - fine. No one will buy that way.\n\nTo this day, we've sold one unit. That I bought. I bought it for my girlfriend - the first \"official\" sale. In the cycle of things that money should've just gone from me then to him (sans transaction fees). That was almost 3 years ago, I think. \n\nThe $19.12 still sits in his PayPal account to this very day.", "id": "d71qwaz", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1472505595, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_504wjz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1473668730, "author": "ewenwhatarmy", "edited": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_504wjz"}

{"body": "Depends on your goals but if money is an issue, you should consider Etsy or something like Wix or shopify.\n\nIf you want to build a wordpress store, here is a basic breakdown on hosting and what to expect.\n\nYou need a host that has one click install of scripts like wordpress for example. There are so many, you can just buy the one with the cheapest plans. But be warned, cheap is cheap for a reason and you will get what you pay for. All the major brands like Godaddy and Bluehost offer this(But be warned, they don't care about your site or it's health). Here is a quick read from a blogger. I wouldn't use these host companies myself but for the price vs value, they have what you need: ---LINK---\n\nThe Nitty Gritty ~ Read if you are doing this for the first time\n\nOnce you get a hosting account and port your domains and install wordpress etc., you will need to know FTP details in case you have to manually upload your theme. All premium themes(Salient in your case) should be able to be installed using the themes upload section on your wordperss settings. If not, you may have to manually unzip your theme and put it in your themes folder. Once you do either you need to enable the theme. If you are going to modify the theme, then you must create a child theme. Best not to modify the theme if you are not good with web or wordpress. Make sure that you have a license for on going updates in the future.\n\nTo get the store running, you will need a plugin like woocommerce. You will also need a paypal account. If you want to process credit cards in other ways, you will need to consult with providers which may require you to buy into an SSL certificate.  You may need to buy add-ons for woocommerce to get the payment gateways to work. They tend to cost $80US with $45 yearly renewals(You have to buy into this for security)\n\nBackups and updates:\nDon't count on the cheap hosts to do this. You need to make your own backups locally or remotely and keep the site updated by performing the updates regularly. Always Make a backup before an update and get familiar with how to restore backups just in case. This is so important on cheap hosting plans, I cannot stress this enough! Use plugins like wordfence to harden and send you notifications on updates to help you keep track of security. DO NOT LET YOUR SITE GET OUT OF DATE!!!\n\nAll the above should do it for you. You can use cheap hosting as long as you are proactive. This can cause you time so if the store gets profitable, you can switch to managed WP hosting plans that range from $15-$30 a month and get you backed up, updated and secured. Godaddy has this for $6 but they fucking suck at it. \n\nGood Luck", "id": "d72q838", "subreddit": "webhosting", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn3h", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1472572789, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_50an54", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1473680469, "author": "jaimequin", "edited": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t3_50an54"}

{"id": "d73rh7s", "body": "&gt; \nin my research, it seems that Printful will be able to handle the fulfillment side of things, and storenvy seems like a good choice for the actual store. \n\nyou said that you already had hosting - so why are you looking at storenvy? they are a hosted solution unless I'm mistaken. \n\nwouldn't you be better off using wordpress &amp; woocommerce (which is free) and hosting it yourself - if you do have a hosting plan already?\n\n&gt; \nlike i said printful + storenvy seems to be a good choice for what i'm doing, but i'd like to hear from anybody that has experience with either of these guys first.\n\nI used storenvy with [printaura]---LINK--- for a while, and honestly did not see much of anything in the way of organic sales through storenvy.\n\nCompare that to Etsy (with which printaura also offers integration) - and the difference is huge. I got (and still get) a bunch of organic sales through Etsy - simply because of their own audience and SEO marketing (what I mean is - I don't pay or advertise or market myself - Etsy as a marketplace brings me these sales). \n\nSo I would go with Etsy (+ Printaura) if you're looking for somewhere to make sales relatively fast. \n\nBut if you want a self-hosted solution and want to (or are able to) do the marketing and drive sales yourself - go with woocommerce. \n\n[Shopify]---LINK--- is also worth considering but that has a monthly cost after the first 14 day trial.\n\n&gt; EDIT: moving forward it seems that storenvy charges $5/month for custom domains. that's definitely something i'd like to avoid - looking at zibbet or bigcartel and leaning towards zibbet for their 10 free items as opposed to bigcartels 5.\n\nzibbet just looks like a smaller etsy so not sure about that. bigcartel isn't a marketplace as far as I know, just an ecommerce platform - so again you would have to generate sales yourself via marketing etc. \n\n&gt; EDIT: i know i'm asking for a lot, but i can't seem to find the holy grail of an online marketplace that allows free listings with custom domains and custom CSS that ideally works with printful. tictail is close. the custom domain charge is a 1.50 per month with a free 30 days. that's pretty good i guess\n\nyou seem to be confusing 'marketplace' with 'ecommerce platform' \n\nwoocommerce, shopify, bigcartel etc are ecommerce platforms. they are pieces of software (self-hosted or otherwise) that allow you to create an online store. usually with ecommerce platforms you can use your own domain name and have complete control over the look and feel of the site.\n\nMarketplaces are sites like Etsy, Amazon, eBay etc. They are self-contained websites - big stores - where you can setup an account as a seller (and have your own shop within their shop). You can't have custom domains and you can't control the look of things (well, not a lot) - because you're just an account on their site. \n\nMarketplaces provide exposure of *your* products to *their* audience which should lead to higher sales. Platforms like shopify provide no such audience/traffic and so you're on your own when it comes to making sales. \n\nAnyway I'm still not sure why you wouldn't just use woocommerce and host it yourself. If you are not so tech-savvy and prefer to stay away from self-hosting, your best best would probably be shopify, if you can swallow the cost.\n\nFinally if you can't contemplate $5/month for a custom domain, maybe you need to re-think whether having your own site is right for you. You could sell on print-on-demand sites like Redbubble, Teepublic etc. and be making money from your designs without the hassle of hosting and dealing with orders. Sure you wouldn't be making as much potential profit, but you would be getting a taste of what sells and understanding the marketplace.\n\nHope that helps.
