I heard they might have stuff for sale at Soccer Village in Middletown, but I\\'d call to verify first., It is ok, I\\'ve spoken to a couple executives there and they\\'re all big fans and support the podcast -- they even went as far as buying me podcasting equipment.  They\\'re actually big fans of anyone helping to grow their platform and there are many service providers and websites that have Shopify in their name., *having changed into a more dancing [dress](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0274/0291/products/Cotton_Long_Sleeves_Club_Dress_gray.jpg?v=1425908868). She sits down next to you, blushing heavily.*, Here are my honest thoughts:\\n\\n1) You are in a very competitive space, especially because you are selling name brand perfume/colognes. What differentiates you from Macy\\'s, Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Saks, Lord &amp; Taylor, JC Penny, Sephora, etc? Why should I buy from you instead of the original company website or one of these other retailers who are trusted and well-known? \\n\\nYou need to figure out what is going to differentiate you from those competitors and make you the best seller of fragrances. Some ideas might be:\\n\\n**Scent recommendations:** Let users fill out a small form and get products recommended to them automatically based on their preferences (scent, type, form, etc). This will make the buying experience more interactive and help people discover new fragrances. This can easily be done with filters on the left hand side of your shopping page, but I\\'m thinking of something fun along the lines of \"I am a [man], looking for [elegant] and [bold] colognes for a [fancy occasion]\". Give your products/website personality. Birchbox does a good job of this.\\n\\n**Samples:** If possible, this can be an awesome differentiating factor for online sales. Allow customers to choose a few products and request small test samples (again, if you\\'re able to do this). This would be a great way to let customers try out the products before committing to a full purchase. \\n\\n**Money back guarantee:** Have a 30 day money back guarantee. This will build trust and people will be more comfortable taking out their credit card (especially since you are unknown). \\n\\n**Product guarantee:**- Prove to customers your stuff is real. There is so much fake brand name stuff online, it\\'s impossible for me to know if these colognes are real. I found that information buried in your about page which will likely be overlooked. You might even add \"Product Guarantee\" or \"Our Guarantee\" in the navigation and have a page that is dedicated to showing your products are authentic (photos, description, your story, etc).\\n\\n**Customer support:** When I come to an unfamiliar ecommerce store and their only contact option is a form, I bounce. It makes it seem like the company is hiding and doesn\\'t want to talk to its customers. Put up a free live chat with www.olark.com and a phone number (google voice or try grasshopper.com)\\n\\n2) Trust: I could not find where your company is located. Nothing on the about or contact page - this is a red flag and most people will bounce if they feel like you aren\\'t an established or trustworthy operation.\\n\\n3) Content: There are spelling errors throughout the site and poorly formatted sentences/content. This is a huge red flag and shows a lack of professionalism. \\n\\n4) http://perfumeyou.com/men-s-cologne-/1432-acqua-di-gio-by-giorgio-armani.html\\nThese product pages are formatted poorly. Remove the floating left navigation below the photo. Move the quantity to be right above \"add to cart\". Put the descriptions above the fold and in the place of quantity. I would also test if removing the red arrow + \"You save\" section would increase your conversions. When you focus too heavily on how much the user is saving (especially for **designer** brand fragrances) it can almost feel too good to be true/sketchy.\\n\\n5) If possible, take your own product photos and use pictures of the boxes when available. The photos to me feel so copy/pasted from the web that it again makes me doubt if the products are genuine. You might even use something like http://3dbin.com which again, ads another layer of differentiation from competitors where people can 3d spin your product photos. Get creative. \\n\\n---\\n\\nOn the marketing side of things, I\\'m not sure what you efforts are like, but here are some ideas:\\n\\n1) Connect with beauty/fashion blogs and offer to provide free fragrances for a written review of your service (from product quality, shipping, customer service, prices, etc). You can also do this with youtube using http://famebit.com. I suspect this will be a good way to get traffic to your site, because again, you are selling in a competitive space and brand name fragrances. If a bunch of youtubers, beauty blogs, fashion blogs, etc start linking to your site saying the fragrances are great, shipping is fast, etc, then you will start to get eyeballs and come up in search more. Which leads me to my next point...\\n\\n2) Check all of your page titles / tags / descriptions - your homepage doesn\\'t even have a proper title tag. I\\'d suggest reading this guide to seo: http://www.quicksprout.com/the-advanced-guide-to-seo\\n\\n3) Figure out who your target customer is and where they hangout online. My hunch is you should be targeting women, because they probably buy fragrances more than men buy cologne. Use Facebook ads to target women who have interests in fragrances, beauty, fashion and create a specific landing page for each ad / audience.\\n\\n4) Tons of ideas on shopify for marketing https://ecommerce.shopify.com/guides/make-your-first-ecommerce-sale as well as lots of other helpful guides\\n\\n\\nHope this helps!, I don\\'t spend that much time freelancing... maybe 20 hours a week or so. When I tell people how many words I write they think it takes up all my time, but I\\'m able to churn out 5,000 words in  2 1/2 hours usually. That would be, for example, a long-form sales page, or a 45 minute VSL or a series of 16 autoresponder emails and so on. Really doesn\\'t take up that much time. Sometimes I write more. For example, if it\\'s a 60,000 word ebook I may buckle down over the weekend and write the whole thing in two days, but that\\'s a rarity. \\n\\nDrop shipping is incredibly easy and I think a lot of people don\\'t move on simple online marketing opportunities just because they think everybody else is doing it - but that doesn\\'t matter. Who cares if everyone else is doing it? For every 10 people in a niche there\\'s maybe 1 that actually knows how to generate paying traffic while the other 9 try it for a month and give up. \\n\\nAll it really comes down to is knowing how to write persuasive copy and utilizing PPC advertising to its full advantage. \\n\\nIn the case of the drop shipping stores it\\'s very simple, I choose $500 to $2,000 items that peoiple with an upper middle class income would want to purchase with disposable income. \\n\\nFor example - gardening sheds, luxury chess sets, kiteboards, custom pool tables, at-home bars...etc. \\n\\nI choose items that aren\\'t dependent upon brand names such as electronics where people want to see Sony and Toshiba...etc. \\n\\nInstead, once I find a niche I look up other stores selling similar items then track down the manufacturers, get their contact information, and contact them directly to become a verified seller. Out of let\\'s say every 10 manufacturers I contact maybe 2 will let me sell their items in my online store (built by shopify for a couple of hundred dollars by a freelancer from Elance) and I simply upload their items and descriptions to my site. \\n\\nThen I utilize Google ads to draw traffic in and I sell the items. When I sell an item I forward the order to the manufacturer who then ships it and I pocket 20% of the difference. \\n\\nSo, basically, I can setup a niche business for a couple of hundred dollars and sell items that I never have to ship, handle, or purchase. \\n\\nIt still comes with some hangups like customer service calls and managing virtual assistants, but other than that, it\\'s pretty simple. \\n\\n, That is a great idea about the \"Sold\" versus \"Sold Out\".  Sold out is the stock option from Shopify (our webstore).  We are trying to figure out a way to change that.

Check [this](http://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.amfora.com.au/Q4OZae5G) out, go to the YSLOW category- there are some things you can optimize on the site itself for sure.

Yes, I know it\\'s pure marketing opportunity for you but there are ways to do that without causing the content to be completely covered up with soul stealing privacy infringement., I\\'ve been doing it for a little bit now, and just opened a Shopify store.  There\\'s been a lot of trial and error, but to get started, here\\'s a few things:\\n\\n* Soy wax is easy to work with and burns cleaner than paraffin.\\n* Pay close attention to temperatures.  Add your scent and dye at the recommended temps, and pour as cold as the wax will allow.  This means your scent throw will be optimum and your wax won\\'t shrink too much in the container.\\n* Don\\'t use any pots or mixing tools that you don\\'t want to use exclusively for wax.  It\\'s difficult to get all the residue off.  While pure soy wax is non-toxic, you might not want the scent and/or dyes in your food.\\n* Candle making is part science, part art, and I\\'m pretty sure there\\'s a little magic involved.  Start out with a couple of small batches and work your way into making larger ones.\\n* Candles need to cure for a few days before they\\'ll perform at their best.  Let them sit for 2-3 days before firing them up, then determine if you added enough scent/dye and adjust your recipe accordingly.\\n* Unless you really know what you\\'re doing, use fragrance oil, not essential oil.  Some essential oils have lower flashpoints, and you could wind up with much more fire than you\\'d intended.  Fragrance oils are made with candles in mind and won\\'t flash.\\n\\nHope that helps...that\\'s all I could think of off the top of my head. , \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC5) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC5.pdf?837) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , I just set up my Shopify site: www.waxfruitcandles.com\\n\\nI finished a fresh batch today, just have to label the rest now: http://imgur.com/6NS1lIt, Yes OP.

However, you have to \"group\" VST\\'s into an instrument rack, drum rack or effect rack first. To do this, load the VST onto one of your tracks; then, right-click it (or command-click on Macs) and select \"group\". As the last step, click on the \"save\" button inside the rack to store it to your user library. After doing this, you should see it on your Push, under Places. And if you sort your user library into folders that match Ableton\\'s standard library folders, the racks will show up there, too. There\\'s also a hack to define additional \"standard folders\" by manipulating Live\\'s config files, if you\\'re missing categories that would better fit your purposes.\\n\\nFor large VST libraries like Komplete, the creation of custom racks takes a while since you have to do this for each and every VST separately. For Komplete, AudioModder offers pre-built wrapper racks: http://audiomodder.myshopify.com/products/push-vst-bridge Those are not free, but you get them for a fair price, considering the huge amount of manual work you\\'re saving. Yet, there\\'s also a minor drawback with these racks: they did not setup macro assignments for the most common VST controls (guess this would\\'ve been another large amount of work). So all racks will show up with all macro knobs unassigned and you will have to do this manually, to your liking., Prestashop if you want to self-host  \\nShopify if you dont, \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC5) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC5.pdf?837) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC4) | ^(2000mAh) | ^(30A) | ^(2012) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC4.pdf?838) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , I hope you won\\'t take offense, but those types of striped tights generally come across as very juvenile.

So far the experience is great. They are super helpful and it is really easy to navigate. One thing we didn\\'t know when signing up with shopify though is that you have to be really on top of developing your website, you can\\'t really just rely on the themes you buy from the platform. We have one [boho website](http://www.playapayaya.com) for which we did lots of the design ourselves and only got a developer in in the last month and a [jewellery website](http://songofjewellery.com) for which we hired a developer from day one. But then, I guess that\\'s the same for everything else. Check our their pricing though. Not sure what the other ones do, but shopify takes a % of revenue - this might keep costs low in the beginning but may be too costly at a later stage. , I guess I\\'m confused about where we\\'re measuring the temperature. If the system needs a temperature gradient to run and the laptop is 90 degrees inside, the room outside should (optimally) still be around 70 degreees (room temperature), meaning we\\'re still getting juice.\\n\\nThe laptop and the room should only be at the same temperature when the laptop is cool (which is a good thing). \\n\\nAnd if the laptop is getting too hot, you can run the thermoelectric generator to cool it down, which is apparently how [some mini-fridges work.](http://power-practical.myshopify.com/pages/how-it-works)\\n\\n&gt;Strictly speaking, thermoelectric generators take a temperature difference and turn it into electrical power.  Amazingly, these materials can also be run in reverse!  If you put power into a thermoelectric generator you will create a temperature difference.

Sigh., I hear you.  With 5 items you can easily use any shopping cart system out there, even the cheap Shopify option.  You will end up having to purchase addon\\'s for most that allow you to work with a payment processor outside of paypal though, so be prepared for that additional cost.  \\n\\nTake a look at https://squareup.com/sell-online  Some locals are using that for a few items and it seems to work well for them but i don\\'t have first hand experience with it., website will cost you 15.00 to buy domain for a year , and under 30.00 a month to host the site on shopify. Build it yourself very simply. \\n\\nYes sending samples costs some money. \\n\\nYou must spend some money to have a successful business or a funded KS campaign. In the grand scheme of things it is still a very cost effective way to try to start a business. \\n\\nThe difference between having some SM presence and being out there attacking on every front can add up to a lot of backers. I\\'m the 1st one to slack off on SM but while my campaign was launching and especially before you have to get as much traction as possible. \\n\\n, There\\'s plenty you can do about the quality for little additional cost.  For example, look at [this](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0713/2197/products/Commander_Brown_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1421700506) photo taken off the website.  This marketing photo doesn\\'t make the product look that good.  Here are the problems I can see from the photos on the site:\\n\\n1.  The edging is stained inconsistently with dye.  This was already covered in the initial review and I\\'m assuming already taken care of.\\n2.  The edges aren\\'t burnished.  This means that after moderate use the edges are going to start to fray and wear.\\n3.  The joint in the side doesn\\'t fit together well at all.  It\\'s cut poorly.  Further, the top and bottom edges don\\'t align properly, making it look bad.  This problem also causes a gap in the top of the box to occur, which is visible in this photo.\\n4.  A result of #3, the rivets aren\\'t aligned.  This again alludes to poor construction.\\n5.  The creasing doesn\\'t look like it was well done.  The edges are overly rounded leaving a less structurally sound corner.\\n6.  [This](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0713/2197/products/Commander_Brown_2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1421700511) photo clearly shows bowing out at the joint.  [This](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0713/2197/products/Commander_Brown_3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1421700515) photo shows it happening on the other side.\\n7.  [This](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0713/2197/products/Commander_Brown_4_1024x1024.jpg?v=1421700519) image shows the inside edges of the box look bad.\\n\\nFor #7 I\\'d just like to throw out a recommendation that would solve a few problems, but it might be better to have the lid be more of a snug fitting shoe box shape, with a clasp that attaches below (maybe like [this](http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI0MFgxMjQw/z/GdEAAOxyc2pTYSZz/$_35.JPG)?).  This would provide a more snug fit, give you options to cover the edging of the box that also serves a functional purpose, and contributes to being more water resistant while removing the flap problem.\\n\\nNone of these add significant cost to the product, and the quality would improve dramatically, though I\\'d also recommend looking at further waterproofing. \\n\\nFinally, the product has absolutely zero branding.  With leather products, the beauty is that you can easily and cheaply brand on it in a way that looks beautiful - stamp or brand your logo onto each product., Your amazing eyes and smile made me think of [this](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0153/0645/products/anidifranco_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1339692189) picture.

Shopify believes that they’ll be a “dead branch of the history of retail” because distribution is so ubiquitous and accessible now. (See; Amazon.)\\n\\n**2: The future of retail is experiential: “It’s not about the product. It’s about what’s being represented.”**\\n\\nTobi brought this up when talking about how Lululemon was converting its store locations to yoga studios. Products are increasingly commoditized– people can get all sorts of products at dirt-cheap prices, shipped to them almost instantly. The distinguishing factor becomes experience, which departmental stores aren’t optimized for.\\n\\n**3: Best Buy is probably going to die.**\\n\\nJason candidly asked Tobi what he would do if he had to take charge of Best Buy, and Tobi conceded that they would probably die, or get carved up somehow. If it is to persist, it will have to adapt and evolve into something very different from what it has been so far.\\n\\n**4: There’s definitely demand for more innovative pop-up stores, but it’s going to be an uphill legal battle.**\\n\\nBoth Jason and Tobi talked about how nice it would be if you could have interesting experiences with creators right in your local area, that didn’t require the stores to buy a year’s lease. Tobi described how there are no options for a retailer in the middle ground between having products and signing a year’s lease. (Crossing The Chasm, anybody?) They talk about how businesses don’t typically get allowed by cities to stay in locations for a month or less.\\n\\nIt’s interesting to think about this in relation to the progress of things like Airbnb and Uber– microrentals are slowly becoming more widespread. Might “Airbnb for Businesses” be a legitimate business in itself? It seems like the bulk of the innovation required for that would be in policy, laws, etc.\\n\\n**5: Kickstarter’s success has very little to do with crowdfunding.**\\n\\nRather, Tobi notes, it has to do with the fact that makers are forced to make videos explaining to people why a product matters, why it ought to exist, and all the loving attention to detail that goes into it. That contributes tremendously to the experience of the product.\\n\\n–\\n\\nBeyond discussing the future of retail, Jason and Tobi also cover a lot about Shopify itself, and the challenges and opportunities the company faces ahead. There a lot of interesting nuggets worth mining, from Tobi discussing Shopify’s initial misstep with their pricing strategy, to the aggressive (and cheeky) recruiting tactic they used to acquire laid-off IBM employees., EDEKA. One of the biggest grocery stores in Germany accept Bitcoin for their Home delivery service. (Bitpay/ shopify) above € 100,00 free delivery Europewide.\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/314ioz/edeka_one_of_the_biggest_grocery_stores_in/\\n\\n\\n\\n, My personal thoughts– it was especially interesting to see Jason ask Tobi about point-of-sale. Shopify released one just a week or so after the video was posted, which means they were already working on it at the time.\\n\\nAlso I really liked what Tobi said about how, ultimately, \"what a product represents\" is the logical end conclusion of what should be the focus of what you\\'re selling, if you\\'re not selling a commodity (eg something that Amazon can sell cheaper and more quickly.), \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Samsung) | ^(INR18650-25R) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Samsung_INR18650-25R.pdf?835) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , Oooh, thanks a lot!

Can\\'t they enable it for Bitpay too?\\n\\nEdit: Don\\'t get me wrong, it is great news, but why limit it to one payment processor if Shopify already has a separate \"Bitcoin\" category with multiple processors? It should apply to all., That\\'s true. I think the wording needs to change. It\\'s more so a notification for you that also has integrations to services you use for your company.\\n\\nI get that Slack does this, but their notifications aren\\'t very rich and meaningful sometimes. I don\\'t see Chirp as an alternative to Slack at all, but something that makes Slack\\'s notifications better, richer, and personalized.\\n\\nAlso useful for solo entrepreneurs and teams that don\\'t depend on chat but want to know updates.

Shopify is cheap with a simple back end, so many of our small clients are on it. , Where is the exact setting located? On Shopify or Coinbase? I can\\'t seem to find anything in Shopify., I agree.  What does your company specialize in for Shopify users?  I work with many Shopify and Bigcommerce users as well.  , I am in the same position as you with merchant fees. However through shopify you are now getting almost the lowest merchant fees anywhere on the Internet. So that\\'s good. Just be aware I found a hook up with square offering an even lower price. So I\\'m going with them. Especially since shopify restricts the kind of e-commerce software you can use., Awesome glad Magento is super easy as well.  We found Shopify worked really well for our current needs. but will keep an eye out if Magento ever makes sense for the future!, Square is a good call.  There seems to be a bit of pressure on credit card fees right now with Square in the space.\\n\\nAre you integrating Square into Shopify?, Squarespace is for blogs that may or may not have an ecommerce element whereas Shopify is designed for ecommerce. There is no CRM for Squarespace. Squarespace doesn\\'t have any inventory controls. There is no native way that you can refund customers or accept alternative payments like bitcoin. It was not designed to be used for sites that sell more than 1 good or service. \\n\\nIf you are selling something spend the $30/mo. and use Shopify. , Hmm I\\'ll look into that this evening. \\n\\nDepends on how easy it is to do in all honesty, might just pay that little extra and use shopify.\\n\\nNope English, why\\'s that? , Well, at least it\\'d be the real deal.  Unlike my locality (growing up) which had [this](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0036/5992/products/imgTshirtNempnett_medium.jpg?v=1255104383), I use Magento.  Currently been with Bank of America merchant services for about 12 years. But their fees are astronomical. So I\\'m going to make this square thing work. I think there are some magento plug-ins that integrate with square. Though Square does not offer any Magento official plug-in. I guess it\\'s not necessary. Got to get going on that this week. But the rates they just offered me are better than Shopify and I didn\\'t think that was possible. Of course I\\'m doing more than 50 K in monthly transactions.

Gift cards, in-depth reports, and integrations with Google Analytics are great. But I\\'ve found the biggest pool of resources to be in the [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com) – take a look around there; they have tools for everything. DM me if you have any specific questions., At this point I am SO DONE dealing with eBay. I\\'m sick of getting the shaft as a seller. Sick of paying stupid fees. I know you get the audience, but I\\'m at the point where I\\'m going to be transitioning to Shopify. I feel your pain. For me, I\\'ve lost hours of my life fighting with eBay, fighting with Paypal.\\n\\nIMO, it\\'s a sinking ship for us small fishes., Well, I\\'ve found Shopify to be way more customizable. The apps really make Shopify worth it. , It means, when using Shopify, at least, the user is directed to a different link that is not hosted on the same primary domain. Also, there are a ton additional extensions that you can add on that allow you to throw in [features, like this cart abandonment plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-abandoned-cart/). I also have one page checkout so the customer has less pages and buttons to have to go through.\\n\\nI\\'m a wordpress dev full time so I love the easy setup and familiarity. It\\'s easy to style up your site and get the checkout pages looking professional and easy instead of the cookie cutter templates you\\'ll find at Shopify and Squarespace. \\n, &gt; Shopify App Store\\nWow those are like amazing.

However, when my invoices started climbing over the $100, it annoyed me because I know I can build my own site on a different platform for WAY less. Hell, the mid-range package on Shopify is only $79. For me, it\\'s just starting to make more sense.\\n\\nDealing with eBay is also tedious.

A lot of coins are trying to create their own decentralized market (AeroMe, Bitbay, SDC, supernet), and also many are trying to create pure anomimity (XMR, Dash) anounomous transactions. There\\'s also a lot specific coins trying to capture the marijuana market (potcoin, cannabiscoin, maryJcoin) because in the US the dispensaries can\\'t have bank accounts. Startcoin is a coin that\\'s being used for crowd funding. It\\'s actually backed by some decent money and names (Russell brand used it), but people are hesitant because it was started by max keiser who started maxcoin which tanked. Finally I just invested in a brand new coin called \"Crave\". It\\'s operates only in tor, and it allows you to create your own anonymous digital assets. Basically it\\'s trying to be like shopify for darKmaerkets. It\\'s trying to allow anyone to set up a dark market on the tor network. It\\'s brand new so I\\'m not sure how valid it\\'s claims are, but I thought the idea was incredibly interesting. \\n\\nTL; DR - alts are trying to get into spaces that Bitcoin hasn\\'t expanded to yet with startups. That\\'s where most of the innovation is driving to. Honestly the best way to know them all is to trade them. In my experience when you day trade alts your leaning curve is a lot faster because you have a vested interest. , This is pretty silly.

(I\\'m not exactly the stylish/trendy type, so don\\'t be too surprised)\\n\\nBeing completely ignorant that about tie slimming, my first thought is \"Why would you want to narrow your existing ties?\". You might want to answer that question in an **obtrusive** way somewhere in the header of your website--although I may be atypical in my ignorance of this, in which case this may be a bad suggestion.\\n\\nAlso, I read in \"Our Story\" that you have your own brand of ties, are they available on your website?...if they are I missed it.  \\n\\nI like the website, is that Shopify?, \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC4) | ^(2000mAh) | ^(30A) | ^(2012) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC4.pdf?838) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , I\\'ve pretty much tried the same list, minus Etsy, and would say the experience is similar except I\\'d comment on SEO results. WooCommerce and Wordpress have always gotten far more organic clicks, the blog system is better and since I can use any host I can ensure the site loads extremely fast. Shopify load times are alright but they aren\\'t great while the blog system is seriously lacking features.\\n\\nPersonally I do Wordpress with WooCommerce and a managed wordpress server so I\\'m not as worried about security; yes I do get the break-in attempts but I\\'m sure Shopify does as well. Shopify just doesn\\'t show you the break-in attempts. Flywheel hosting is fast and reasonable priced, wpengine is alright but if you need an SSL cert the minimum plan is $99/month.\\n\\nThe part where Shopify still has the slight advantage, if you\\'re site is being integrated with inkfrog and eBay. This syncs all your products back and forth and it\\'s better than the Wordpress plugins because inkfrog actually sends the images to eBay\\'s servers for hosting. All the Wordpress plugins I\\'ve come across simply hotlink to your site images which uses your bandwidth and if you ever needed to go stealth you\\'d be fairly screwed because your url was embedded in all your old listings., I learned a lot about Woocommerce and am an avid WP user, as I mentioned. However, it seems like EVERYTHING costs money. Want stripe? You have to pay. Want a shipping table? You have to pay. Want anything that comes included with a $30/mo shopify subscription, you have to pay. And sometimes up to $79 for one license. I don\\'t mean to sound cheap, but not all of us have that kind of money., Ya this is a volume issue as much as a process issue.\\n\\nWe use Shopify to manage our processes because all our orders are already in it. Through a series of tags and saved searches we can move an order through the pick, pack, ship process and see where everything is at any give time. However, our shipping value isn\\'t huge so take that with a grain of salt.\\n\\nManaging employee workload is always a balance for us. So all of our shipping people are cross trained in some other area of our business needs. IE Social media, blogging, customer service, etc. so that if shipping happens to be slow one day we still get productive hours out or our team.\\n\\nTracking costs for us is also on the simple side because we ship a standard item and so the average pull, pack, ship time is fairly consistent. We also only use like 4 or 5 different box sizes that are all roughly the same cost.\\n\\nNot sure I provided any help there but that\\'s how it works in our warehouse., Haha, make sense!\\n\\nWorking on an explainer video – maybe it will help if I put our tagline, \"Your neckties slimmed down.\" in the header or somewhere really visible.\\n\\nThanks for catching the bit about original designs in \"Our Story\" – I have been meaning to change that, as we were working on original designs. Fixed now!\\n\\nYeah, we LOVE Shopify :), Hi, I am doing something very similar by making my own web store through woocommerce so I don\\'t have the monthly fee of shopify.\\n\\nI am starting to use someone who supplys the t shirt, prints and posts it for under £10 but of course depends on sizes and colours., Damn, so sorry for you, and this hits really close to home.

Even though it wasn\\'t proper shattered into tiny bits, it took me nearly 2 months to be able to pick up something heavier than a cup in that hand, and forming a proper barre chord is still very strenuous after all that time. I had to adjust the nut on my guitar to make things easier for me. Even now I still have a trigger finger, but I\\'ve managed to adapt my playing around that.\\n\\nAll this might sound very disheartening, but trust me, it gets better. Just sheer will goes a long way. I don\\'t know how bad your particular case is, but this is how much it is still doing me in for, pay attention to the range of my index finger: [link](http://imgur.com/a/84DMy). These are pictures I\\'ve taken literally 20 minutes ago. I still have a triggerfinger there as well, however I\\'ve managed to adapt my play to mostly play around it. For anyone wondering, yes, I have discussed surgery with my doctor to fix this trigger, but I\\'ve decided that I\\'ve got enough function and no pain any more, so a surgery would only be a risk. To add to this, my luck in the gene pool puts me at a near certain risk of Dupuytren\\'s contracture as well, so that might put me in for surgery later anyway.\\n\\nOne thing that really helped my was my local arts and music centre where the national symphony orchestra and many other orchestras and ensembles played. They had a physical therapist come in three times a week, who was obviously specialised in dealing with musicians. I had biweekly therapy there for a year, and twice a month after. I think it was this above all that helped me recover from it, so if you have similar facilities available near you go out and see if you can find them. She gave me instructions that I could do throughout the day, every day, and getting them in your schedule really helps. I also still have some [Rainbow putty](https://www.ncmedical.com/item_887.html), green, that I use whenever I feel that I need more exercise. Just kneading something like that, even starting from the softest variety, could really help you regain your strength in that finger. IANAD though, so take all this advice with a pinch of salt.\\n \\nAnyways, if you have any questions I\\'ll be more than happy to answer them., Integrate all your websites into one website with a list of multiple locations.\\n\\nI\\'d recommend Shopify, since on each product you can add a drop down box for variations of each product...each option can be the local pickup site this product is available.\\n\\nOnce your sites are all integrated, research SEO ( search engine optimization), and get your site to pop up on search engines., \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(LG) | ^(ICR18650HE4) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/LG18650_HE4.PDF?828) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , I get that part of course, I just thought I could simply send all my products boxed up straight to Amazon in bulk then they automatically send them out via the Amazon fulfilment service when orders are placed on Amazon/my website via Shopify Amazon plugin..?, \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Samsung) | ^(INR18650-25R) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Samsung_INR18650-25R.pdf?835) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , As soon as I get my private pilot\\'s license, I\\'m planning on getting one of [these](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/6413/products/patch_large.jpg?v=1414456928) patches just to screw with people., I wouldn\\'t collect emails in the store..it\\'s too late. You need to collect them online and the best way to do that is to produce really good content and promote it.  \\nWhat is the problem that your customers have?  How to choose a comfortable mattress?  What to do with their old mattress?  How to choose a mattress if partners prefer different types of mattress (hard / soft)? Produce some content that addresses your users\\' problems and capture leads from it.  \\nCheck out tools like [sumome](http://sumome.com/) for capturing emails on a blog and I like [Wistia](http://wistia.com/) if you have the budget to produce some basic in-store videos with how to guides. With Wistia you can gate your videos (ask for the email before the user watches it) or ask for the email after they finish watching it.  \\nSuggestion: offer a discount code for in-store purchases that they will receive via email if they provide their email. That should see a high conversion ratio.  Squarespace is a good CMS that you should look into when you convert all your stores to one site. It\\'s got a great blogging system and supports shopify.  , My vans, red shorts, and my favourite [Shihad t-shirt](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0654/4045/products/t-shirts_1024x1024.jpg?v=1411959088).

There are rigid lines coming from the central triangle which allows each section to sag under body weight away from the center and sides., decent, but 3 years behind. more professional than the average shopify attempt, and you definitely have ambition, which i admire. galaxy/allover print is dead tho. also, it\\'s good to see you\\'re beginning to branch into cut and sew. your best bet for next season is to embrace more minimalism - maybe find a motif or logo (like supreme or palace) that works on its own? not bad for now though!, There\\'s no way BC had no info into this before 3 days ago. If that\\'s true, they are at fault for not keeping track of their storage solution. I\\'m no systems architect but I think they should have redundancies in place for things like this. \\n\\nThe most frustrating part (aside from $10k+ in lost revenue) is that they didn\\'t tell anyone this was happening. No email, no alert on the dashboard where everyone would see it. I had to go to the BC forums to find out why there are fucking pages missing from my site. I spent a few hours trying to replace the files thinking we did something wrong only to discover that it was BC\\'s problem all along. They better change that 99.9% uptime. Even more annoying is their deceptive wording - \"stores may be slow blah blah blah\" they\\'re not \"slow\" they\\'re straight up fucking broken and their lies are unacceptable. We\\'re already planning our move to shopify. , This are the shoes I mentioned: http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0219/7724/products/converse-x7652-ct-all-star-white-2.jpg, \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC4) | ^(2000mAh) | ^(30A) | ^(2012) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC4.pdf?838) |\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC5) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC5.pdf?837) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , Be careful with this. The benefits of things like Shopify is that someone is taking care of it for you. If you go with Wordpress and use it for ecommerce, and you fail to keep it updated, then someone *will* hack your site and you will eventually be on the hook for the stolen credit cards and other awful crap that can happen., \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC5) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC5.pdf?837) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , I\\'m curious on your Shopify experience.  What kinds of items are you selling?  How much traffic did you get to your site?  How well did it convert?  Did you do any advertising or SEO?\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to get traction in the search engine results against Amazon, eBay, etsy, etc., I would say the jacket is a tad too big. [Here\\'s](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0094/2252/files/2_83b6e244-dbb6-4f7f-8236-6166a4367718.jpg?9590311217791172095) a good example of how bomber jackets should fit., [Tank Girl](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/tankgirl/images/0/0a/Hewl-Tanky.jpg) is usually portrayed with [smaller breasts.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0185/4636/products/tgcover_1024x1024.png?v=1384449641) Her breasts also tend to be more pendulous than projecting, and that\\'s pretty danged rare in *any* art. \\n\\n[Though she sometimes prefers outfits that give her a somewhat different silhouette](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111130700/4094473-2266063370-15327.jpg). (Fixed link!)\\n\\nEdit: Keeping with the Hewlett train, he does [Freakangels](http://cdn.avatar-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Freakangels-Vol-6-9781592911332-JPEG1.jpg?100bf3) and the heroines in that have fairly diverse looks, [including breast size](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29088/1420479-freakangels2e.jpg)- especially since they\\'re all kind of related. , Have you tried eBid? I looked at the site after I saw it mentioned on Etsy. It doesn\\'t have much of a user base and there aren\\'t many listings.\\n\\nEtsy is something you have to work at. My Etsy shop didn\\'t start to sell well until I got nearly 100 items in my shop. Spreading out the listings, tweeting and being active in the forums also helps. It\\'s not an easy place to sell, but my items don\\'t sell on Ebay at all.\\n\\nThanks for this overview, I may look into Woo and Shopify later today., \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(LG) | ^(ICR18650HE2) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/LG_18650HE2.pdf?827) |\\n| ^(LG) | ^(ICR18650HE4) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/LG18650_HE4.PDF?828) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC4) | ^(2000mAh) | ^(30A) | ^(2012) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC4.pdf?838) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , Take a look at Shopify and its integration with Printful.

We have a ton of customers that want to use Paypal, and abandoned carts and other apps like eBay integration, social login, saved carts, affiliate program apps and other things have really increased our sales. The apps are worth it. It\\'s so much more flexible than Squarespace currently, though I think Squarespace is in the process of adding \"apps\" as well now - though it will take them forever to catch up to Shopify.\\n\\nOne rip off on Shopify is the reporting- have to pay an extra $50 for halfway decent reports., \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Samsung) | ^(INR18650-25R) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Samsung_INR18650-25R.pdf?835) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC4) | ^(2000mAh) | ^(30A) | ^(2012) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC4.pdf?838) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Samsung) | ^(INR18650-25R) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Samsung_INR18650-25R.pdf?835) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Samsung) | ^(INR18650-25R) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Samsung_INR18650-25R.pdf?835) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , The Shopify store is getting more items!

I\\'ve seen a few people that just can\\'t get into it regardless but most have tried the generic cartridge style or the cheaper tanks styles like [this.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0255/3461/files/electronic-cigarette-parts.jpg?1413) I tried one of those and went back to cigarettes shortly thereafter. It wasn\\'t until I got a bit more into it that I found what I liked.\\n\\nAs for info, there are a couple good subs, as /u/ZombieWeinerDog suggested /r/electronic_cigarette is one. /r/vaping is another but don\\'t get too overwhelmed, some of the sites and subs make it seem very complicated when it doesn\\'t have to be. There is a thing called \"cloud chasing\" which is, to put it simply, trying to make the largest [\"cloud\"](http://ecigssa.co.za/data/attachments/5/5066-bf593dafaccd69ae2bbfd6a22d89ddb1.jpg) of ecig smoke you can and people have made it a science. \\n\\nAny good B&amp;M ecig shop should be able to help you get set up. They have starter kits, there is a lot of good info on those subs and on the internet in general. As for myself, I have found a lot of luck with [Kangertech](http://www.kangeronline.com/) equipment, specifically their subtank but again that might not be what you like. My honest recommendation would be to go to a shop and talk to the employees. Just like a good B&amp;M for cigars, a good ecig shop should take the time to show you what they have and find something that will work for you. Let them know what it was about the ones you have tried that let you down. They should also let you try a bunch of different juices to decide which flavors you like best. If you get stuck PM me and I\\'ll see what I can do to help. Also I think there\\'s a BOTL from /r/cigars that is involved in the ecig market somehow too.\\n\\n, \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC4) | ^(2000mAh) | ^(30A) | ^(2012) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC4.pdf?838) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Samsung) | ^(INR18650-25R) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Samsung_INR18650-25R.pdf?835) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(LG) | ^(ICR18650HE2) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/LG_18650HE2.pdf?827) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , Google is your friend! http://www.shopify.com/bitcoin\\n\\nI personally wouldn\\'t do Bitcoin on any of my shops die to the price fluctuations - the value can change hour to hour. \\n\\nThe great benefit is no chargebacks.

Your price is much much higher., If you integrate bitcoin using any of the available payment processors, such as bitpay (who Shopify uses as a payment gateway), the funds are immediately in your account as USD. You can actually set this however you want, but assuming you only want to be able to advertise to bitcoin users so they can spend money on your site, you don\\'t have to deal with the fluctuations at all. Theres really no reason not to take peoples money.\\n\\nSource: I\\'ve been \\'in\\' bitcoin for a very long time., There are a lot of misconceptions, including the comments already in this thread.\\n\\nFirst of all, you endure no volatility risk if you accept bitcoin as a payment. Bitpay is the processor/payment gateway that Shopify is partnered with. You have the option of accepting money however you want, including have the bitcoins people send to bitpay immediately put into your bank account as USD. Its seamless. People who like using bitcoin can pay with it and you never have to do anything. You don\\'t need a bitcoin wallet or anything really. \\n\\n**The only thing you are doing is giving people another way to give you money. **\\n\\nEven if a small amount of people choose to do so, you are increasing your risk by 0 while adding potential revenue.\\n\\nMajor companies accept bitcoin in various ways, including Overstock, Dell, Microsoft, T-Mobile, etc... If they thought that accepting bitcoin would hurt their image in any way at all they wouldn\\'t have done it. Some, like Overstock, choose to keep a small percent of the money in bitcoin, while others take the USD immediately.\\n\\nAgain, its incredibly easy. Years ago I know /r/bitcoin was friendly to businesses coming on the sub and saying that you accept bitcoin and usually would get a nice bump in sales that day/week, followed by awareness of the fact you accept it after the fact. There are several different places you can put your name on a list that are dedicated to bitcoin accepting businesses. Its free advertising.\\n\\nSeriously, its incredibly easy to integrate, you get free advertising, and aren\\'t exposed to any of the risk people associate with bitcoin. It won\\'t make an unsuccessful store successful, but it can certainly bring in more sales., \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC4) | ^(2000mAh) | ^(30A) | ^(2012) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC4.pdf?838) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Samsung) | ^(INR18650-25R) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Samsung_INR18650-25R.pdf?835) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , Shopify is an easier option though!, [This does not bode well...](http://i.imgur.com/NBNS4YS.png)\\n\\n*edit*\\n\\nAfter closing that, the rest of the site is quite nice.

You are correct, energy is much cheaper in the U.S., but it is much more effective to compare individual states in the U.S. to countries in Europe since the U.S. is absolutely gigantic in comparison and different parts of the country have massively different heating and cooling needs.  , Yes, I did websites for too cheap as my 2 main clients had their own \"web design\" companies but actually outsourced the jobs to me.

Yikes...\\n\\nLooks nice, though! Very modern., [His GF though...](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0275/6675/products/womens_blue_white_britt_large.jpg?v=1389888597), Good question! \\n\\nFirst of all - there\\'s a big philosophical difference between Shopify/BigCommerce and Launchpad. \\n\\nLaunchpad is something that you, as the business owner, outright own. You\\'re in complete control of your site, and always will be. Shopify/BigCommerce/etc. is something that you\\'re basically renting from those companies. At the end of the day, they have complete control of your site.\\n\\nFor instance, BigCommerce recently announced new limits on how many categories, products per category, etc., that stores could have. If you had a BigCommerce site, you had no choice but to alter your store to fit their new limits. \\n\\nWith Launchpad, you have complete access and control over your site\\'s code, where it\\'s hosted, etc. so no one will spring surprise changes on you. \\n\\nAlso, Launchpad\\'s cost is a one-off. Shopify and BigCommerce\\'s monthly fees add up over time. For instance, if you sign up for BC\\'s $200/month plan, if you assume your business is going to be around in 21 months (less than 2 years), you\\'ll have spent more on BigCommerce than on Launchpad.\\n\\nNow, the really big difference - features. A few of the features built into Launchpad that Shopify/BigCommerce don\\'t include (and in most cases can\\'t even be added on/modified into either of those platforms):\\n\\n* eBay &amp; Amazon integration to allow you to easily sell your products on your website, eBay and Amazon and manage all of your orders in one place. This is built in, no additional cost other than any fees charged by eBay/Amazon. \\n\\n* Everything is truly unlimited - unlimited users, API calls, categories, products, etc. - you don\\'t have to worry about needing to upgrade if your business grows. \\n\\n* Triggered emails (automatically send an email when someone abandons their cart, but also on their purchase anniversary, when new products come in stock that are similar to what they purchased in the past, etc. - these can easily add 10-20% to your monthly revenue)\\n\\n* Braintree payment gateway support built in, including tokenization (a safe, PCI compliant way to allow your shoppers to store their credit cards offered by Braintree, one of the most merchant-friendly, lower-cost credit card payment providers out there)\\n\\n* Built in social shopping support, including giving your visitors a discount in exchange for sharing your products on social media\\n\\nThose are just the first few off the top of my head. Let me know if you have any other questions!\\n\\n, look extremely guilty when they eventually pass and look at you. I usually give them this face \\n\\nhttp://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0317/0649/files/guilty_dog_face_large.JPG?5819837962455406021, The 10k price tag might be steep, but we don\\'t know what the scope of work is. Like others have mentioned, there is value to every part of the website beyond the coding. Time is worth money. Whenever you don\\'t want to spend your own time, be prepared to pay for someone else\\'s time, usually at a premium. \\nHaving said that, given how intuitive Shopify really is, the website itself could probably have been done for a lower dollar value if she had the time to set it up.\\nWe recently set up our own Shopify site with a free theme with little to no custom coding. It took us about two weeks to set everything and do our own photography. We are still making tweaks to it and making changes. Fairly happy with the results so far.\\nwww.maisondesbows.com, The order message that appears is indeed fake in that it\\'s not actually happening in real-time. However, they are real orders. It\\'s a Shopify app called [Notify](https://apps.shopify.com/notify). \\n\\nMy tie slimming company [SKINNYFATTIES](http://www.skinnyfatties.com) uses it and it actually has boosted sales. It creates a sense of urgency and excitement around your products, so brilliant if you ask me., Thank you for all the comments, and opinions they go along way and are extremely helpful. For all those mentioning Shopify, I completely understand thats what should have been done. However, she is pretty technologically challenged and with 95% of her business done through online sales, its an investment. Again I\\'m not 100% of the $10K but it was a lot, and probably more than she should of paid, however what\\'s done is done. , &gt;The order message that appears is indeed fake in that it\\'s not actually happening in real-time. However, they are real orders. It\\'s a Shopify app called Notify.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t criticizing the app, just curious if he really was killing it already.\\n\\nIs there a way to slow it down so it only pops up say every 10 seconds?\\n\\nWow...I just checked out your website...that\\'s crazy that people pay $30 to tailor an old tie instead of buying a new one for $30. I am not criticizing your model, by the way, just blown away that people are paying this much money for a tie they already own. Then again it\\'s been a decade or so since I\\'ve owned a tie so I am pretty out of the loop in that world :) Actually, that\\'s not true...I had 1 up to about 5 years ago, just for the occasional job interview., &gt; I admit I\\'m not tech savvy at all but can\\'t Nike implement captcha that changes with every attempted purchase? One purchase I need to pick images. Next purchase I need to enter letters. Can a bot solve captcha if it doesn\\'t know what kind of captcha is coming at it?\\n\\nDon\\'t quote me on this, but I would assume someone could tweak a bot to make it interpret the input. If it requires a click, then the bot would know that it is an image. If it requires character entry, then it is a traditional captcha. One thing that even confused me is why Nike doesn\\'t use different pictures each time. The issue was that the bot devs just grabbed each image Nike used so basically it would go like this: \\n\\n    * \"Click on the Bird\"\\n\\n    * Bot goes through its image directory and looks until it finds the picture that matches with one of the 4 pics that Nike provided. \\n\\nTraditional captchas have been bypassed, but I\\'m curious as to why they don\\'t go with the different image technique. That\\'s why I\\'m somewhat suspicious and believe that Nike doesn\\'t want to knock out every bot user completely. Just deter the entry level users. \\n\\nAs for eradicating bot users, a vast majority that we see on twitter carting 30+ pairs are running behind proxy servers. They rent proxy server space and allocate a proxy to each account or two, so their real IP is never used. That\\'s why an IP ban isn\\'t enough to combat it. Some people even go as crazy as to rent cloud server space nearby Nike\\'s Oregon headquarters. By doing this, they can achieve a near nonexistent ping between their machine and the servers Nike uses for it\\'s site. This allows them to literally be the first in line for almost every release. It\\'s getting insane how far people will go to make some money now, however Nike is stepping in a bit more now, which is why the whole \\'Cart selling/pre-order\\' service is becoming so rampant. These resellers can\\'t get away with shipping 30 shoes to their house anymore (as a few people have learned the hard way), so they had to devise a new means of scalping. Nike can\\'t really take action since as I mentioned before, they\\'re hiding behind anonymous IPs and throwaway Nike accounts. \\n\\nAs far as legal action, I don\\'t believe a bot can count as anything illegal (IANAL so I\\'m not 100% certain). A bot is basically running the same process a normal user is doing, but at a much faster rate. It\\'s not exactly fraud since you aren\\'t impersonating someone else or stealing credit cards. \\n\\n&gt; Hasn\\'t Ronnie Fieg fought bots with some success? What has he done in the past? \\n\\nHaven\\'t done a Kith release since the Coves/Mints I think, so I\\'m not exactly sure what\\'s up firsthand. However I have seen people get their orders cancelled under suspicion of botting, so some action is being done. If I remember correctly, Kith uses Shopify for their checkout, which is definitely prone to abuse. Shopify allows a user to instantly add an item to cart and checkout before a shoe even releases because it creates a unique URL before the shoe even goes public. The URL can be accessed by anyone (unlike Nike carts where you have to sign into your own account), so people have been able to check out with a shoe before it even goes \\'Live.\\' \\n\\nLong story short, online sneaker game is messed up a lot now. However one thing that should be noted is that there is a \\'critical mass\\' point where if too many resellers get into the game, the prices of each release will plummet. It happens with most GR retros. So many resellers will cop that the greedy ones will undercut each other offering lower prices than the same people selling an identical shoe. Eventually buyers will only be willing to pay so much and everyone else has to lower their prices as well. \\n\\nThe prices of shoes can\\'t really rise if every pair is in the hands of a reseller keeping them DS. Prices rise because people are wearing their pairs and less and less shoes are in new condition. Examples of this are the Lance Mountains and Black/White 1\\'s. Both are shoes that people loved to wear rather than keep on ice, so the amount of deadstock pairs decreases daily. Both have been skyrocketing in value recently. I ended up paying $250-300 for both my LMs and now they\\'re currently 425-500 on flight club. And w/ the B/W 1\\'s, they were going for below retail all day a few months ago &amp; now the price has skyrocketed to ~300. Its absolutely absurd, but shows 1 key flaw that a lot of those hardened resellers tend to ignore. \\n\\nI\\'d love to see it all fizzle out as well. Maybe not completely, but enough to where I don\\'t have to pay thousands for some Yeezys haha, &gt; but $10K? To edit a template and attach the modules / plugins that shopify gives you for free?\\n\\nWhy not?\\n\\nTaking a template and building it out into a valuable business asset takes skill and experience. Not just in programming HTML, JS, PHP, but also working experience with the platform.\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s the business analysis skill required to make the site suit the purposes of the business.\\n\\n$10k sounds reasonable for a business owner to pay if they want a professional to provide the kind of value that a site like the one linked to provides.\\n\\nOne issue is that the buyers and developers undervalue the skills required to build sites like this. But the outcome of underinvestment is just about always the same: dissapointment, crappy sites, unmaintained sites, sites that don\\'t support the owners business goals...\\n\\nIf business owners want good sites then they have to invest. \\n\\nOn the other side, if developers want to make great sites then they have to be supported well by the business owner.\\n\\n\\n, Alixious, I did that an hour ago or so.

The company I worked for used to bend over backwards for their enterprise customers, assigning X hours every month for feature building and maintenance for each client. Clients would take advantage, borrowing time from future months. You need to be strict.\\n* SaaS can scale but you need to give your customers everything they need, be it features, tutorials and/or documentation.\\n* If you do custom work for enterprise clients you should make sure that you are able to upgrade clients despite these custom features. Upgrading took so much time because custom features were applied directly on top of the core codebase.\\n* If custom work is stopping you from scaling then build your app so that custom work can be done by a third-party (via an API), document it well and tell your customers to hire a dev directly (like Shopify do).\\n\\n\\nTo summarise, I always wanted our company to move toward SaaS as I felt like they should have improved their core product adding features that would have helped sell it for years to come.\\n\\nThey also made some mistakes spending a lot of money on servers when they could have been leveraging AWS or something similar (we had virtually empty dedicated servers)., Product photography is all about the styling for sure.

So Im trying to find a part time job that is close (between Sedro Woolley and Rockport if anyone happens to know the area) and during the more AM hours so I can make sure he eats breakfast and be here to make him dinner.\\n\\nJuggling all these things is killing me., \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(LG) | ^(ICR18650HE4) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/LG18650_HE4.PDF?828) |\\n| ^(Samsung) | ^(INR18650-25R) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Samsung_INR18650-25R.pdf?835) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , Sure, we\\'re using Refersion for affiliates, it works OK but I think it confuses our users - it\\'s more of a hardcore affiliate program.

They could probably market it for you too.\\n\\nAlso, if you are in need a web developer, I have a lot of Shopify experience., Thank you! \\n\\nI do like that Shopify is so versatile but the core feature set of Squarespace is so phenomenal that unless you need the versatility it\\'s so hard to beat SS. (Xero, Mailchimp, Shipstation, Stripe, FB/T/IG/Tumblr/Pinterest right out the box, with built in templates that are phenomenal and easy to make look unique)\\n\\nThat said; I do want to be able to handle affiliates, and without some kind of Google Analytics magic, I don\\'t think there\\'s any way to do it with Squarespace., Don\\'t use Amazon.  It is more expensive and you can\\'t trust the vendors to supply legit parts (especially with regards to MOSFETs).  I spent far too much money on counterfeit MOSFETs from Amazon and ebay when I first got into building, don\\'t make the same mistake as me.  If I were you, I would be everything from Mouser (or Digikey,  but I like Mouser better) except for the 510 connector and the sled.  Get a 3d printed sled from Vape3d or Snortin Boar and a Varitube or FDV 510.  PLEASE don\\'t buy a MOSFET from anywhere but Mouser, Digikey, or a similarly reliable electronics component vendor.  If Mouser or Digikey don\\'t have the enclosure you would like, modcrate.myshopify.com/ sells good Hammond clones for cheap as well as G sized no-lean aluminum CNC machined enclosures as well (they are fucking beautiful and a steal for less $15 a pop)., \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Samsung) | ^(INR18650-25R) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Samsung_INR18650-25R.pdf?835) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , [Source](https://www.facebook.com/HealAlexis/photos/a.707961449288634.1073741829.706600656091380/792015887549856/?type=1&amp;permPage=1) and [donation/store page](http://team-alexis.myshopify.com/) to help Alexis and her family!, [Best State Ever](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0240/0945/products/434_37_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1371656601), Squarespace does have a good core, but you\\'re stuck with just those. I think PayPal and eBay sync alone have more than tripled our sales. Squarespace - I found our free themes much more elegant, and the UI outside of ecommerce functions was great - it was much easier to create good looking content, blogs, and especially galleries. Shopify also has better built-in Google Analytics \\'detailed\\' ecommerce tracking than Squarespace. , [Vendor](http://greengardengold.com/collections/all)\\n\\n[Lab Results](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0629/0125/files/Gold_Oil_Lab_test_02122015.pdf?14469738378714791776), This makes me sad like LieBot\\'s [Saddest](http://achewood.com/comic.php?date=11052001) [Things](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0159/5500/products/achewood_poster_NEO-STRB-060203_larger_1358280868_1024x1024.png?v=1358280015)\\n\\nIt\\'s ok, little Spirit, we\\'re sending some people to come dig you out.

You need to show the image alongside how it\\'d look in a room. Show how it would look in different frames and in different sizes beside a silhouette man so people can make decisions. \\n\\nAlso these are important for you to consider:\\n\\n- On listing page add the \"add to cart\" option below each image\\n- On top of page add \"Satisfaction guaranteed\" and \"Free shipping\". Price your products so you can offer free shipping. $30 + free shipping will earn you the same revenue per sale as $25 + $5 shipping BUT you will sell 10x more by offering free shipping; it doesn\\'t make sense but it\\'s the way it is. People create excuses when shopping for products and it\\'s why shopping cart abandonment averages are so high.\\n- Add a call to action to the page and try to entice sales (e.g. \"Buy 2 get 1 free\", \"Buy by Midnight and save 10%\", etc.)\\n- Once you fix the above weaknesses then, and only then, consider posting on social media sites as others have suggested. No need to drive traffic if your website cannot close sales effectively.\\n- Search engines hold ecommerce websites to a higher standard. If you want your website to gain some reputable rank you need to include a business address (not a shared PO Box because if there has ever been a BBB complaint associated with the zip code it\\'ll harm your rank; not help it). It should also include a business phone number. These are costs of doing business.\\n- Search engines look for specific pages to be included in ecommerce websites. At the bare minimum you need a clearly defined \"Return Policy\" (should be on it\\'s own page and clearly, easily labeled); add this ASAP.  You must stand behind your products or search engines will not.\\n- Checkout goes to https://checkout.bigcartel.com. This ecommerce provider has a page rank of 6. You should use one of the reputable ecommerce providers such as Shopify or Bigcommerce which have much higher page ranks and are known by search engines to validate the authenticity of their ecommerce sellers; it\\'ll help boost your rank due to increased trust in that your business is authentic.\\n- Change your website page title to enable search engines to index you properly from \"Home / Night Sky Posters\" to \"Buy Posters Online | Buy Night Sky Posters\"\\n- Change your headers to add benefit to your search engine rank (e.g. change \"Night Sky Posters\" to \"Buy Night Sky Posters Online\")\\n- Change your images to add benefit to your search engine rank (e.g. change \"Star Cluster Pismis 24\" to \"Buy Star Cluster Poster Online\")\\n- Change your images ALT text to add benefit to your search engine rank (e.g. change \"alt=\\'Image of Star Cluster Pismis 24\\'\" to \"alt=\\'buy star cluster poster online\\'\")\\n\\nHope that helps!, Check out the [Hagerman Audio Labs Bugle2.](http://hagerman-audio-labs.myshopify.com/products/bugle2), [Literally Ginger.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0384/0921/products/workaholics-bear-coat.main.jpeg?v=1416416458)^^^let\\'s ^^^get ^^^weird\\n\\n, \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC4) | ^(2000mAh) | ^(30A) | ^(2012) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC4.pdf?838) |\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC5) | ^(2500mAh) | ^(20A) | ^(2013) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC5.pdf?837) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC4) | ^(2000mAh) | ^(30A) | ^(2012) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC4.pdf?838) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC4) | ^(2000mAh) | ^(30A) | ^(2012) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC4.pdf?838) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC4) | ^(2000mAh) | ^(30A) | ^(2012) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC4.pdf?838) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , Thank you, great idea. How do you feel about WooCommerce? A good alternative to Shopify?, I don\\'t change grips between the backhand in the forehand. I\\'ll talk about my grip in forehand terms. It\\'s a semi-western forehand grip (so, the knuckle is on [bevel 4](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0134/9182/files/how_to_grip_a_tennis_racket_large.jpg?225)), very slightly rotated so that I\\'m using the lower part of the bevel (close to the corner between bevels 4 and 5) rather than the middle part of the bevel.\\n\\nIn backhand terms, using that diagram, that means that my knuckle is on bevel 8, but on the part of 8 that is close to the corner between 8 and 1. The edge of the knuckle is right before the corner.\\n\\nThis actually works really well for both the backhand and the forehand, and it allows me to hit heavy spin groundstrokes on both sides, as well as hitting relatively flat shots when I want to. My backhand doesn\\'t have a problem hitting high balls, which is a problem for a lot of people with one-handed eastern backhands., \\n&amp;nbsp;  \\n\\n ^Brand | ^Model | ^(Rated Capacity) | ^MCD | ^Released | ^(Full Spec)\\n:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:\\n| ^(Sony) | ^(US18650VTC4) | ^(2000mAh) | ^(30A) | ^(2012) | ^[Link](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0674/3651/files/Sony_VTC4.pdf?838) |\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;  , Absolutely! What kinds of things would you be looking for to improve your experience with Shopify?, Shopify is a really awesome cart. I\\'m a web designer and have just started to build on it and I have to say, I\\'m impressed by what they have out of the box. I also like developing for it because you have a lot of control over customization features that are easily modifiable without having to lay a finger on any code. Their documentation is pretty great too! Let me know if you\\'d like me to point you in the right direction. , I\\'d agree that it\\'s a crap shoot. I\\'ve seen people like OP who were very happy, but I\\'ve also seen a lot of people who weren\\'t.\\n\\nI bought those same purple keycaps from his Ebay store, and I was really disappointed. [This](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0267/1905/products/IMG_5871_1024x1024.JPG) is the photo of they keycaps posted on his Ebay listings and website.

Keyword Analysis: You\\'re most likely to get a bulk of your traffic through Google search. Conduct a thorough keyword analysis of your business. Pin down the obvious keywords such as \"physiotherapy toronto\" \"chiropractor scarborough\" etc etc. Check out the link: http://www.shopify.com/blog/14207073-the-beginners-guide-to-keyword-research-for-ecommerce\\n\\n2.) Banner Ads: Try and place your banner ads on places where your target audience is most likely to be. E.g. You could place an ad on Youtube for people looking at videos for back and spine exercises. \\n\\n3.) Retargetting Ads: Have your ads follow the visitors after they leave your site. They will keep your business fresh in their minds.\\n\\nJust a side note, please ensure that your website is optimised for a mobile screen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n, I\\'d recommend hosting it locally, because from source you\\'re hosting via shopify (not sure if it\\'s on the same server, if not, don\\'t worry.)\\n\\nTry remaking the video and compressing to a smaller file size.\\n\\n?Make the video shorter., Ah, I see. I think buying at retail may be the way to go then. If it means anything, we use Shopify. It\\'s easy to use and quick to set up.

Came across your question so I took it as a sign and started looking around.\\n\\nThe usual brands I go to for grinders are Sharpstone, Space Case, or diamond grind. Heard good things about Santa Cruz Shredders, and Mendo Mulchers. Checked out all their websites and apparently 3 piece grinders are not the bee\\'s knee\\'s right now.\\n\\nYou trip and break your neck over all the 2 piece and 4 piece grinders, plenty of 5 piece grinders as well. But 3 piece, no sir.\\n\\nOnly Santa Cruz Shredder has a 3 piece, but it is a bit over your budget. It sets you back about $50.- which is more than my 5 piece Sharp Stone. They do look good.

Basically, we are giving you the tools to create a digital sales person to walk someone through the purchase process. \\n\\nGuidelines is fully customizable and built using Responsive Design principles so it will work great on all devices. \\n\\nWe are really passionate about this app and want to make sure we built the best solution possible.

Thank you in advance., It depends on what kind of website you want to build. \\n\\nIf it\\'s something complex like a big app \\'à la startup\\' and you want to build it yourself, well, learn whatever you have to. Would I recommend this? No. Building a big/complex app is... complex!  And the thing is that building the app/website is only a fraction of what you would need to generate money. You\\'ll need marketing, etc... So, do you want to spend 1 year to build an \\'idea\\' that will potentially not work? Especially if it\\'s the first time you try something on the web. Trust me, been there done that.\\n\\nWhat I would recommend if you want to start a business on the web:\\nEither start with Wordpress and a paid theme (some people have million dollar business just using Wordpress). You wouldn\\'t even need to code anything. Read about content marketing, affiliate marketing, SEO, etc.\\n\\nOr, find an easy to implement idea. Like something that would be easy to integrate with an e-commerce store (shopify), for example.\\n\\nOr, if  you really want to code something, I would suggest you to find an idea that you can implement with a simple form. Check out the 7 days startup book (I think it\\'s like 3$ on Amazon). You could simply buy an HTML theme from themeforest.net, add a form with PHP, and go from there. If it works, you automate it more. \\n\\nAnd, I don\\'t see the point of going with Ruby if you\\'re starting out and you don\\'t want to become a professional web developer. Yes, ruby is the cool kid, but building something simple with Ruby will take more time than with PHP, I guarantee it (if you\\'re just starting to learn programming that is). And, nothing prevents you to learn Ruby after you have your simple website done with PHP.\\n\\nAlso, you can take a look at /r/webdev, /r/php, /r/ruby, /r/seo, /r/wordpress\\n\\nGood luck!\\n\\ntl/dr : Don\\'t create a big complex app if it\\'s your first try at a business on the web, you\\'ll lose time. Do something simple with PHP, forget Ruby for now. Try your super simple idea, if it doesn\\'t work, you didn\\'t lose 1 year of your life on a business that doesn\\'t work. , Similar but not exactly the same.

Thanks for the tip. , Thanks, i\\'m in the process of switching to Shopify right now and i\\'ve fallen in love. I don\\'t even know how i made money for so long on Squarespace. I definitely was not utilizing the best environment for my customers.

Denver area has no shortage of breweries (one of two places on the map with a circle in a circle)... I\\'m about 7 hours East in Lincoln... we have like 3 or 4 legit breweries within an hour of here.

It is not unlike Shopify or Woocommerce, which give you a templating engine that you can toy around with and build upon. You also have access to their API which you can pull from pretty much whatever language you want. I hope that works out for you! , Yea, for concentrates you can get away with a $20 attachment like [this](http://www.gentlemansvapes.com/products/v2-mega-oil-cartridge-holds-1-gram-new?source_app=shopify-widget&amp;referer=http://www.gentlemansvapes.com/blogs/news/6151022-how-to-put-marijuana-concentrates-and-thc-liquids-in-an-electronic-cigarette) and a cheap eGo battery.

There are limitations like with all shopping cart platforms, but I have used several, including my own custom built one, and Shopify has been the best so far. Proceed with confidence on that front., I am starting an online store through shopify. I will be selling in a niche with products that can be very expensive.

If you want food that lasts forever, then you should stock up on things like dried corn and honey. Also: seeds. You can\\'t live off rations forever. At some point you will have to start farming, so you might as well learn how now., Stop using GoDaddy, they\\'re a joke. Just go get a Shopify account and start making sales. I think they\\'re hands down the best ecommerce system for beginners. They\\'re not too flexible on some things, but without shelling out a ton for custom ecommerce it\\'s the best there is. I also dont like wordpress ecommerce platforms because WP is first and foremost a blogging engine. While the e-commerce plugins are \\'ok\\', I think it\\'s best to go for companies that specialize in e-commerce, not 3rd party plugins which try to shoehorn a circle into a square hole., Hey guys, my e-commerce website www.badlandsboards.com is looking horrendous on mobile. Does anyone know how to optimize a shopify store for mobile browsers?, Shopify shut me down off their payment processing for selling \"pseudo pharmaceuticals\". I talk about this in this blog post I made: http://nicksid.com/selling-drugs-for-fun-and-profit/, Hey - \\n#1 - check out olark.com - your requirement is pretty vague but you might find what you need there. You can see it running on our own site www.cadoraclothing.com if you are curious about what it looks like \"in the wild\".\\n\\n#2 - will be challenging because what you are talking about is a configurable product. It will be challenging because you will probably need to invest in designing and building something custom to allow a user to build a ring and configure it based on your available parts. This isn\\'t something that SAAS like Shopify and Squarespace handle out of the box as it is too industry specific. Check into Shopify\\'s App store, look for developers there with high marks and reach out to them with a spec and ask them what a customized app would cost. Squarespace\\'s app ecosystem isn\\'t as mature so I\\'d stick with Shopify for now. There are also other options like Magento, etc. but IMHO if you are just starting out go with Shopify - it is just easier to use. \\n\\n#3 - plan to do some coding (see #2). This isn\\'t a slam dunk type of site. Configurable products introduce complexity, but if done well can really help you sell. Check out moo.com - they\\'ve done an excellent job at configurable product UX.\\n\\ngood luck\\n\\n, First, where are you located (returns page indicates in California)? How much is shipping to Canada? I love this shirt: http://www.teezusapparel.com/collections/t-shirts/products/stripes-pocket-tee :)\\n\\nOther feedback:\\n\\n- If you haven\\'t already, setup Google Webmasters (http://www.google.com/webmasters/, https://docs.shopify.com/manual/configuration/store-customization/social-media/verify-with-file-uploads) and Google Analytics (https://docs.shopify.com/manual/settings/general/google-analytics). With Webmasters you can track your site\\'s indexing status and any issues. With Analytics you can track sales, conversions and abandon rates and learn from your site.\\n\\n- I noticed you are using Shopify. If you haven\\'t already, install this free app (https://apps.shopify.com/google-shopping) and fill in the required fields for all your products so they\\'re listed in Google Shopping; this will help boost your organic rank and gain you valuable screen real estate by showcasing images of your products when people search for them.\\n\\n- Include valuable call to actions - FREE shipping &amp; GUARANTEED satisfaction. If you need to adjust your product pricing to offer free shipping, do it. If you sell a shirt for $25 with $5 shipping or $30 with free shipping you\\'ll get significantly more sales with the latter even if it\\'s the same cost.\\n\\n- Search engines hold ecommerce websites to a higher standard. If you want your website to gain some reputable rank you need to include a \"Contact Us\" page that includes a contact form, email address and business address; not a shared PO Box because if there has ever been a BBB complaint associated with the zip code it\\'ll harm your rank; not help it (note: I did notice that you have address on your \"Returns &amp; Refunds\" page).\\n\\nThis is a solid start, we can chat more once you do these improvements but in general your site is nice, clean, visually appealing with high quality product images; you need to generate traffic and build the trust with potential customers critical to increasing sales - clearly defining fair shipping (free if possible) and satisfaction guaranteed linking to your policy re: returns will make a huge difference.\\n\\nHope this helps! :), ~~I\\'m sure~~ I know it\\'s not legal to sell, but damn, [is Trisha fine.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0077/6072/products/TrishaHershberger_2PI.png?v=1415383935), These are just thousands of physical businesses accepting bitcoin: \\n\\nhttp://coinmap.org/\\n\\nWith tens of thousands more online: \\n\\n\\nhttp://www.coinjabber.com/\\n\\nLocalBitcoins.com Exchangers in 240 countries and 7413 cities \\nhttps://localbitcoins.com/statistics\\n\\n\\nSome of the big companies and institutions accepting Bitcoin:\\n\\nRakuten, PayPal, Microsoft, TIME Inc, DELL, VirginGalactic, CheapAir,TigerDirect, OverStock, Expedia, Newegg,Warner Brothers, T-Mobile (Europe), Pokerstars, Xhamster, Sacramento Kings,Uber, Wordpress,Wikipedia, Mozilla, Khan Academy, EFF, United Way, Burning Man,Nas, 50 Cent,Greenpeace, Wikimedia Foundation, Zynga, Dish Network, NewEgg, Suntimes, Gyft,Ronald McDonald House, Intuit, 1-800-Flowers, LordandTaylor, Shopify, Foodler, Digital River, Scan, OkCupid, PointTown, Overclockers, Takeaway, Wix, Cheaperthansteam, eGifter, Etsy, King’s College, Neteller, OKCupid, Mint, Pizzaforcoins, Reddit, Square, Twitch.tv, Zappos, Menufy, DailyDealy, Dynamism, Grasscity, Save the Children, American Red Cross, Greenpeace, The Water Project, United Way, Literacy Bridge,TradingView, Spar,CeX, F64 Studio, ESPN, Fiverr, Shipito, DriveWealth, Runbox, Archive.org, Golden Gate hotel and casino, porn industry, gambling industry, gaming industry,US political campaigns, etc.\\n, Wow. What an ass. You clearly are not a developer and probably don\\'t have the funds to pay a legit developer to build this functionality for you. As `mehphp` stated, you can\\'t just \"tac on\" functionality to a CMS that doesn\\'t exist inherently. How do you do that? \"OH DUH\" you make a fucking app. You stupid retard. I hope you get downvoted to shit you rude jackass. You sound like a typical shop-owning client with a tendency towards condescension and ignorant, unfounded patronization. I hope your business and your stupid idea fail. , Also, this is you:\\n\\n\"I was looking for some guidance in the coding your own department.\"\\n\\nLearn English, jackass.\\n\\nMy guess is by the time you read all of this, you\\'ll delete this entire thread/question and move on with your life. That, of course, assuming you don\\'t have the unfounded pride to ACTUALLY try and make some snark-ass comment and sound intelligent, which you obviously aren\\'t. My suggestion for you: delete this Reddit account and go hang yourself, \"Hey guys. My shop sells dildos. Big black dildos. I\\'d like to send out weekly notifications to users that we are constantly increasing the size of our big black dildos. They are tested in my own asshole, so we know they work well.\"\\n, Ha.

It\\'s just to keep me busy. Get back to work you plebs. I\\'ve got more dildos to test. , [deleted], The platform is important (in terms of daily management, scalability, support, reliability, etc.). What\\'s more important though is being fairly certain of your unique selling proposition, how you\\'ll stand out in the marketplace and WHY people should buy from you. \\n\\nWith that said, if your products don\\'t violate any of their terms, getting \\'shut down\\' shouldn\\'t be a problem with Shopify.\\n\\nAnd in the right hands PPC can be a profitable channel, it just takes testing and careful management., If you really don\\'t like PHP ( I assume you\\'ve used modern PHP and don\\'t like it for some reason, rather than the \\'I use a Mac and all PC users are dumb line of reasoning. \\' )\\n\\nShopify is a good product, and they have reseller / partner programmes. I believe it also had its origins as a Rails project.\\n\\nHosting your own: \\n\\nRails has SpreeCommerce\\n\\nPHP: I\\'d go with either concrete5 or wordpress with the relevant ecommerce plugins. I think Concrete5 has a more user friendly interface for the client.\\n, I recommend Shopify for all ecommerce sites, I\\'ve (soft) launched my shop today at http://objetschoisis.com/ so I can\\'t share much about where the traffic is coming yet. But I can explain what I expect to happen.\\n\\nI am in the process of building Google Adwords campaigns and Facebook campaigns for my products. I think the paid traffic will be the way to go for me until the end of the year. By then, I expect my customers list to have grown to a point where I can get repeat sales from existing customers and start to get organic traffic via SEO and Social Media. \\n\\nBy the way, I didn\\'t use Shopify but a smaller player called Prestashop Cloud, which is like Shopify but free (no monthly charge, no % of sale). They support themselves via premium plugins and themes., Thanks for the Giveaway mate, Was really looking forward to getting this game.\\n\\nYour son\\'s superman game is on point, but can he pull [this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0290/8145/products/9d569c70-a925-11e3-920b-3f5c79bce655.jpg?v=1394546482) off?, Yes opening a shopify store is great tbh, I went to google and this was the first glorious picture: http://hdwallpaper.freehdw.com/0002/nature-landscapes_hdwallpaper_glorious-sunset-in-alskan-autumn_12814.jpg\\n\\n\\nStrange, should be something along the lines of: http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0290/8145/products/9d569c70-a925-11e3-920b-3f5c79bce655.jpg?v=1394546482, Probably what you didn\\'t want to hear but the website... It\\'s really bad! It definitely needs more work IMHO.\\n\\n- The colours almost hurt your eyes.\\n- The logo is poor and looks cheap.\\n- No pictures of products.\\n- The social links at the bottom go to Shopify\\'s.\\n\\nThat\\'s just a few., [I would love to win this right now.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0290/8145/products/9d569c70-a925-11e3-920b-3f5c79bce655.jpg?v=1394546482), hey! you\\'re on Shopify.  We kinda talked a bit over Twitter.  Want to get you on my podcast: http://shopifymasters.org some time, I think it\\'s a great site. The color scheme and font definitely fit the brand I would imagine a Paleo diet related company would have. \\n\\nI would recommend changing your favicon since right now it\\'s the Shopify icon. \\n\\nI think the top checkout bar (blue) doesn\\'t go well with the actual non-static top bar (hazel/brown) but other people might like it. The very bottom light blue where it says your company\\'s name also seems unnecessary. \\n\\nIf you care about getting e-mails your newsletter signup box should stand out more. I missed it the first time I went through the site. It may increase conversions if you have one of the modals to register e-mails (I\\'ve never used one so I don\\'t have data on it). \\n\\nAlso just a tidbit. You should use hyperlinks when using a website in the text. Look at \"formatting help\" for Reddit to see how. \\n\\nHow are you guys going about marketing this?, Best way to promote a crowdfunding campaign is through free PR from bloggers.  And to do that you need a story that\\'s nicely packaged up for the blog writers to agree to feature you. \\n\\nDo you have a story that you can tell?\\n\\nIf you do, include some pics and quick outline of your story.  Put together a massive list of blogs that have audiences that could be your potential customer and start cold emailing.\\n\\nHere are a couple podcasts that I put out that features ecommerce entrepreneurs that go their start on Kickstarter (including one entrepreneur that\\'s a Redditor):\\n\\n* http://shopifymasters.org/flypedals/\\n* http://shopifymasters.org/codeandquill, Might not need a web developer.

Planning on styling them similarly., GoDaddy has changed a lot in the last 2 years, the company is modernizing its products and the design. Most ppl just know GoDaddy for Domains and traditional Hosting, but it always had other services like WYSIWYG site builders and more recently we built a brand new Online Store product.\\n\\nhttp://onlinestore.godaddy.com\\n\\nThe goal of the product is to be as easy as possible for you to get your store up and running in a few minutes but also flexible and powerful enough so you can grow your business with it. On top of that, GoDaddy will always try to be affordable for ppl to start and we don\\'t charge anything for credit card transactions like other do.\\n\\nhere is a great story I recommend you guys to read: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/31v96m/i_created_a_business_in_3_days_with_reddits_help/\\n\\nI would definitely not recommend going the Magento or Spree route unless you have a very stablished business with a good revenue stream and the solutions in the market do not fit your needs at all.\\n\\nE-commerce is not easy and security is a major part of it, there are tons of regulations and if you host your own solution you need to be careful about how you handle the Credit Card information (PCI Compliance). Services like GoDaddy Online Store, BigCommerce and Shopify remove that complexity from the users and you don\\'t need to hire a developer for it.\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: I work at GoDaddy in the Online Store Product., it\\'s a downforce wing that comes with all [Subaru WRX STI\\'s](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0597/3629/products/Subaru_WRX_STI_Generations_display_1200x1200.jpg?v=1416563209) but ok.

Adore the look of these [HeadPorter+](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0051/7042/products/Quilting_Sweat_PantsGrey7_large.jpg?v=1415832980) sweats but not sure they\\'re it. Ability to go beltless (lace tie, sidetabs, etc) is a big bonus. Ideas?, Kill the logo on the top of each product pic on the front page.  I understand that it\\'s probably the box.  But I\\'d rather have bigger product pictures instead.  Or maybe a more 3 dimensional image telling me that that\\'s the box.   \\n\\nI want to see more cake and less branding.  You\\'ve done a good enough job branding the site as is.  \\n\\nAlso change your Favicon to something other than the default Shopify one.   \\n\\nEverything else looks great!, Interesting. Maybe it\\'s because brunch is pretty casual here but I don\\'t see an issue if you have nice quality sweats and want to wear them out. Would it make a difference to you, if you were going for more of an athletic look instead of just throwing on sweatpants to be comfy? I sometimes go out in something simple similar to [this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0259/3835/files/JohnElliottCO_ShadowCapsule_Lookbook_02.jpg?14377), Have you had the Warped Flor Del Valle yet?

It\\'s not even a good anything platform any more.\\n\\nI make juice, but I have also been a web developer for the last 20 years. I make an awesome cart. Here\\'s an example of it http://www.full-traction.com/\\n(That\\'s running on a single CPU and 1GB of RAM along with 5 other sites for that client doing about 80,000 visitors a month)\\n\\nI chose not to use it personally for Cloud Provisions due to the stupid simplicity, ease of use, and unlimited scalability of Shopify.\\n\\nNote, I do not work for Shopify.\\n\\nAgain, Wordpress is not an ecommerce platform. Any developer who tries to tell you they can get Wordpress to scale, is a bad developer.\\n\\nTry Big Commerce as well, they have finally upped their game.\\n\\nIgnore Volusion., The voltage rating for most switches are likely higher than 5V. 5V would be suitable since it\\'s higher than the max voltage of your batteries (4.2V).\\n\\nLook at the ratings for DC. If only AC is avail, you can apply \"DC rule of thumb\" https://www.carlingtech.com/amp-hp-volts#3\\n\\nhttp://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0608/6153/products/Dual_18650_Wiring_Diagram_1024x1024.png?v=1411856231\\n\\nIf using a slide switch like shown above, the switch doesn\\'t need to be rated for high current.\\n\\nBasically any SPST switch that is an on-off, off-on, or SPDT on-on type will work.

I saw it on Facebook as well, and browsed through some of the comments. There was a lot of \"I make handicrafts; how do I get started?\" and \"how is this different than Etsy?\" Both of which indicate to me that it\\'s not clear to the commenters how Shopify works.\\n\\nFortunately, the service that Shopify does provide (a platform to build your own ecommerce site) is such that I think a number of the people who wouldn\\'t research it first would be turned off by the amount of work they have to do just to get up and running, never mind to actually manage a profitable store. Unfortunately, if they require a credit card to start the 14 day trial, I\\'m sure there\\'s also plenty of people that will sign up, abandon it, but forget to cancel in time., [BEFORE...](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0411/9605/products/Design_a58da046-7720-4e43-a330-bc108e924fc7_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1421985547), They are two pairs of [Ardell Whispies](http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/sleekhair_2273_2804156511) stacked.

If you want I can send you the name of our developer who does shopify/wordpress custom dev work. I found him by browsing through people who do custom work through and are recommended and (vetted) by shopify!, Thanks for reply.  I have a jewelry brand I started with a single product on amazon , sold out with small inventory now I\\'m in middle of getting larger inventory for next run.  I have setup a site on shopify but it doesn\\'t make sense to make a site just for a single item. So I\\'m waiting till next batch to get that part up, Thanks and glad you pointed our the SSL, our site is hosted through Shopify and the checkout is done on their servers however I\\'m going to double check into this., Shopify charges you a monthly flat rate and I think 3% on top of merchant fees? So you end up paying like 5% + $0.30 per transaction + $20 (or whatever it is) per month. \\n\\nIt might be easier but definitely not the cheapest in the long run. , Yeah it\\'s a Shopify app called Notify. I actually just uninstalled it. Sort of expensive and people were giving me heck for it. , When I was looking around for building a website for my buddies ejuice, I am almost positive Shopify didn\\'t allow vaping sales. BigCommerce has many different payment suppliers and a few of them allow vaping sales. It was pretty much the only one of those type of companies I found that allows vaping sales. I wanted to use SquareSpace but their payment supplier doesn\\'t allow vaping either., Hey, I have a moving gif on my homepage ( [uprosa.com](http://uprosa.com) - store based on the minimal theme). If you use the normal \"Customize Theme\" feature, I found that the problem is that even if you upload a .gif file the code in the backend will store the image as a .jpeg and therefore make your file static. You would need to edit the html of the settings.html file in your Configs tab to make your input function save the uploaded file as a gif instead. hope that helps!, On sale, it\\'s indeed interesting. \\nHahaha, I\\'m guilty, I bought yarn from Fibre Detours and Mont Tricot as it was very good deals in the last two weeks.

It\\'s great if you are technical or have access to someone that can handle it inexpensively. There are a lot of free add-ons for payments that make it a great platform to get started with. Pair this with good web hosting from someone like iPage and you\\'ll have a very inexpensive starting platform. Think of Prestashop as your first car, it is cheap, reliable, it\\'ll get you from A to B and you can keep upgrading parts here and there until you die.\\n  \\nI spent roughly 30 hours setting up a shop for a client, this included all product uploads, photo manipulation, copy writing, SEO, theme modifications, and heavy code modifications. I went with Prestashop because the site needed to be fast overseas, and with the other hosted solutions they can be slow if your customers are located in Asia.  \\n  \\nHosted solutions like Shopify, BigCommerce, and Volusion are pretty similar in my book. It is like leasing a car, they handle maintenance but it is more expensive. I really like Shopify, I can\\'t wait until I can build out a store on that platform. They seem to offer some really great extensions which would make the day to day management of an eCom store much simpler., If you go with BigECommerce or Shopify, lemme know, I\\'ll set you up with my payment processesor who does e-cig shops, http://kinaye-motorsports.myshopify.com/collections/all\\n\\nGot the motor and wheel from here., Shopify uses Stripe (Wells Fargo) as their processor. You can\\'t use that, but you can plug in almost a hundred other different merchant processors with their API, some of which do allow high-risk product sales., I didn\\'t know you could use a different processor for Shopify, thought you had to use theirs. That\\'s basically what you\\'re doing with BigCommerce anyway, except they have a bunch built in for you easily., What about shopify vs wordpress?\\n\\n, [Definitely not the only ones...](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0738/6759/products/friendship-shirt-1_large.jpg?v=1421429667) \\n\\n, James Krause\\'s KC t shirt.

The video is about facebook likes specifically which I know is a big problem for people who are buying likes.  But [advertisers]((http://adexchanger.com/online-advertising/report-facebook-pulls-ahead-of-google-in-us-digital-display-ad-revenues/) are using facebook to purchase clicks for the targeted audience to go to their website/fb page, not necessarily to purchase likes.  The value is in people paying for targeting highly specific demographics.  I don\\'t know how to cite this but there are plenty of people making a living doing things like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2553d8/how_an_excon_turned_his_life_around_and_built_an/) using facebook ads facebook ads + shopify, + their website.         \\nFake accounts aren\\'t a problem in this respect as people don\\'t just click ad for fun and marketing companies do use facebook ads  \\n\\nIn terms of ads, my friends and I hate it when we see ads that are related to posts we made (ex. vacation, clothes) or our web history which means the targeting is working.\\n\\nWhen I need to look up somebody I haven\\'t seen in a while I search them on fb and usually find them using friends of friends.  Employers check fb accounts, and they probably won\\'t stop.  I don\\'t care if more adults than teens are using fb.  FB still has [1.2 billion active monthly users](http://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/) as of the last quarter of 2014 which is much more than it\\'s ever been.

It\\'s estimated [2.5 billion people](http://email.about.com/od/emailtrivia/f/how_many_email.htm) use email\\n\\nPeople put a lot of their pictures on fb, and fb lets people click a button to make super sentimental slideshows every holiday.  It hooks you.  You need to have a facebook account to see those photos, especially those in the past of when you were younger or of events you remember and you need an account so people can tag you.  FB Timeline, doesn\\'t really exist for twitter or instagram.  Your whole life is presented the way you wanted it to be presented on your timeline.  \\n\\nI know dozens of people who said they\\'d stop using facebook that ended up coming back after a few months.  You took so much effort on the way you wanted to present yourself and easier to market to people sharing their entire private life story.

Just now, right before I read your message, I reached out to Shipwire and said this:\\n\\n\\n&gt;I run a necktie slimming company on Shopify. Customers mail us their neckties, we slim them down and mail them back out. I would like to find a solution where after they place their order, a mailing label is automatically generated so all the customer has to do is print the label, throw their ties in a box, and ship them to us – any idea how to go about this?\\n\\n\\nDo you have any solutions for this?, I\\'m a developer not a designer so take my critisism with a grain of salt:\\n\\nOverall, not bad. It\\'s very easy to navigate and find what I\\'m looking for. The only negative that really jumped out at me was the main slider on the homepage. I\\'m not sure if it\\'s just the image selection or if it\\'s the arrangement but it just looks too busy. In my opinion, that space should be reserved for one clear call to action. \\n\\nI found one bug on your site: [Grid Issue](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u1ytie0zlbleqcp/Screenshot%202015-04-10%2009.19.25.png?dl=0)\\n\\nIf this is your first theme, then you are doing great. Congrats!, Bluehost would work, also. If you have an idea of your end goal, I could probably steer you a bit. \\n\\nIf you want to start selling product/service ASAP, Shopify and Squarespace are great. There are plenty of downsides to using them as well, but you can do a lot with you, and the have a full-blown site developed once money is flowing and you better understand the needs of the site., This is what we use with our store:\\n\\n* Vantage Analytics - Gives us an in depth view of our customers, also can help with targeted facebook campaigns\\n* Product Reviews by Shopify - gives reviews :)\\n* Contactified by Katz Web Services - automagically stuffs new customers into Constant Contact (there is also a mailchimp app for the same thing)\\n* Subuno - Advanced fraud protection - worth the money in keeping fraudulent orders down\\n* Product Upsell by Bold Apps - Tries to upsell the customer as they go do checkout\\n* Product Discount by Bold Apps - Allows you to easily schedule sales of products, even for just an hour\\n* AutoResponderMax - Followup emails after a customer orders, lots of options\\n* Exit Offers - Offers a last attempt to save customers who have something in cart who go to leave the site\\n* Swiftype - improved site search with analytics\\n* Bulk Discounts by Shopify - Sometimes its nice to bulk create coupon codes\\n* Sales Motivator by Bold Apps - Does a popup at the top of the site to remind people as they approach a goal.. for example we give free shipping for orders of 50 and over, and this lets them know how close they are.\\n* ShopPost - Easy posting of product blurbs to Facebook or Google Plus\\n* Forewards - Offers a rewards to people who post a link on facebook or twitter about us\\n* McAfee Secure - secure badge showing that we pass basic security tests - a feel good thing for customers.\\n\\nOf them all, Vantage Analytics is one of my favorites, they are great people who try to keep involved with their customers and are constantly improving their app.  We ran a smart campaign on facebook using their setup (targets people like our customers) and it was as easy as pressing a button to get rolling.\\n\\nWe also really like subuno, while we don\\'t have a lot of fraud, they have caught every attempt since we started using them.\\n\\nThe rest of the apps we like enough to keep and if paid, keep paying for them.  They all contribute to our store in some way, and I regularly review their performance and try out new apps and remove ones that don\\'t perform enough to justify keeping them., You can try in /r/forhire . Their documentation is on a request basis so I\\'m not 100% sure what it\\'s capabilities are or how difficult it would be to implement. There is this php wrapper : https://github.com/seancorgan/Endicia\\n\\nit\\'s a year old though. Oh, you asked for help earlier on here, platform is shopify. Might want to check here first : \\n\\nhttps://apps.shopify.com/integrations/Endicia\\n\\n, An implementation of the API should not be too hard. How are you planning on implementing this into your Shopify store though?, The [xkcd store](http://store-xkcd-com.myshopify.com/products/citation-needed-sticker-pack) sells citation needed stickers. , I think there are two main ways to make money from podcasting. Get a lot of scale or help solve problems for a niche. \\n\\nI see a lot of comedy podcasts on here but it\\'s going to be hard to get scale because people are already busy listening to Joe Rogan and WTF that it\\'ll be very hard to get scale. Not saying that it\\'s not possible just saying that it\\'s probably the hardest route to making a living. \\n\\nIf you\\'re solving a problem for a specific niche you can make money and not just from the podcast ads but from associated products. I have experience in building business focused podcasts to solve problems for business people. Within 4 months of starting I was making a couple hundred an episode and am now generating $1K a month in revenue from the ads and associated products and am in my 10th month. I plan on scaling my podcast business to $10K/month over the next year. Not just from my podcast either but the podcast is the platform that gives me an audience and clients. , Thank you! I will check these out. Bold Apps makes really incredible stuff. I originally went with 3dcart because they have a recurring subscription (physical product) module and nobody else did, but Bold makes this for Shopify, so that makes it easier to move platforms., I recently switched from BC to 3dcart.  What made you want to switch from 3d to Shopify?, http://counter-logic-gaming-store.myshopify.com/products/clg-classic-shirt\\n\\nUnless you mean CLG jersey., We partner with Shopify, Volusion and BigCommerce.  We are usually putting the smaller teams on Shopify, and so from what you\\'ve shared with us I would absolutely steer you there.\\n\\nIt\\'s absolutely the fastest way to improve your platform. You will out grow it at some point, but those are problem you don\\'t need to worry about yet., Almost like a sign from above, here\\'s today\\'s Blipshift shirt.  \\nhttp://blipshift.com/products/sall-good \\n\\n[S\\'all good](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0166/4148/products/sall_good_detail_grande.png?v=1428597504), Myrs are actually already apart of that set! \\n\\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0790/8591/products/Screen_Shot_2015-04-10_at_11.43.32_AM_large.png?v=1428680882\\n\\nIt\\'s in the same file with the tokens I\\'ve listed above. :D, Are you trying to do this all purely on the front-end or are you making a custom application?\\n\\nTo answer your questions broadly though, Shopify limits (for good reasons) the amount of products you can return at a time (250 is the max for the API) but I believe you can return 1000 on the front-end. \\n\\nIf you can explain exactly what you are trying to accomplish I can help you more specifically. , Wow, a screenshot and everything. You are awesome, thank you.  \\nExcellent point on the banner, Ill see if I can set up another snippet for a less cluttered look., It\\'s for front end only, for custom searching effectively.\\n\\nThe request limit is 50, at least it was when I\\'ve built sites previously and its stated in the documentation (though that might be outdated).\\n\\n, I have used DOZENS of carts and I love shopify. Is it the perfect fit for everyone? Of course not, but with what it sounds like you\\'re doing it should work wonderfully. There should also be an app out there that will allow you to automatically sync with your ebay store if you can not export a spreadsheet of your products from ebay itself. Take the plunge with a free account and see how far you get and whether or not you like it., Honestly, just read the [Shopify Blog](http://www.shopify.com/blog) end to end. They have more then enough great content on most of those topics for free., They really are nice.  I wear them all the time - just added a [black lake mix](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0276/5047/products/IMG_5492.jpg?v=1409422445) to my closet. \\n\\nI\\'d recommend that you size up.  The fit is pretty slim.  The mediums have somewhere around 18.5\" pit to pit iirc.  I have larges &amp; when they are new they\\'re actually still a little too tight.  The knit loosens up a little with wear though.   For reference, I\\'m 6\\'0\\', about 175lbs, 40.5\" chest., Maybe a red or yellow tie would pop more? \\n\\n[This guy](http://www.petershearer.com.au/library/catalog/suits/peter-shearer-wolf-kanat-adelaide-blue-check-suit-brooksfield-shirt-knitted-tie.jpg) obviously looks great; also imagine substituting in a tie like [this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0186/6406/products/11f-lmonaco130370mugonapais3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1394920642).\\n\\nThis reminds me: I really need cutaway collar shirts..., Shopify user here as well.  Also an initial adopter of the POS.  Really like shopify.  Very easy to design/use/integrate.  Security is fine on it, never had an issue.  \\n\\nThe only downsides to it that I\\'ve experienced are:\\n\\n* No carrier-rate based shipping on the mid-level plan.\\n* Reporting sucks on the mid-level plan\\n\\nOther than that, it\\'s a great platform and they are awesome to work with.  I\\'ve talked to the CEO on a Sunday before over an issue I\\'ve had.  They\\'re good people., You can absolutely bring in more products that 50 at a time, I\\'ve done it multiple times and I believe it\\'s up to 1000. I wouldn\\'t do that necessarily though as it\\'s a very slow request. \\n\\nI\\'m not sure what your skill level is but if you can accomplish your filtering task using javascript, then you can ajax the products in using multiple paginated calls. The way I usually do it is to make an alternate collections template and I return the products in json format using the JSON filter {{ products | json }}. Now you essentially have an endpoint that returns your products in json format at /collections/all?view=mynewtemplate.\\n\\nApologies if that is vague, but I can attempt to clarify further., My solution so far is exactly what you suggest :) Make a template with no layout, use the paginate liquid object to write out paging info into a json object, loop through the collection.products and write them into an array.\\n\\nThis works fine but, I\\'d rather not have to page as its an overhead and only implemented that when I remembered the 50 item limit.\\n\\nIf the limits not an issue I can drop the pagination, I couldn\\'t test it because I have &lt;50 products in my store. I guess I\\'ll create more products and see what happens.\\n\\nThanks for your responses, it\\'s good to see something other than spam in this sub ;), Overall, I\\'m really liking the design/colour scheme. The only thing I dislike is the product item boxes on the home page looking cluttered. If it was my theme I\\'d probably remove that and have the user click through for more information. Just my opinion. , There\\'s some huge clients on Shopify, are you sure they\\'d outgrow it?, Enterprise level Shopify user here (on Shopify Plus). We transitioned from Magento to Shopify about 8 months ago and it\\'s been on of the best things we\\'ve done. Very easy to work with and costs a fraction of what we had to pay to keep Magento running how we wanted it too. They\\'re making great strides in handling larger businesses as well (us being one of them. usamm.com)   \\nFeel free to shoot me any questions if you decide to make the switch. I\\'ve got an amazing development company I could recommend for it as well., We are about to release our Shopify app called [Credible](http://www.convertwithcredible.com/). \\n\\nIt shows recent purchases to new visitors on your site. Helps build trust and create urgency. Let us know if you want to be a beta tester! We\\'d love to get your feedback on it when we launch!, Thank you. Do you mean the front page collection or the products that are listed in the banner?, No problem. Also, look into the limit filter. That is how you can set the collection to return more than 50. , The front page collection. Out of curiosity, have you submitted the theme to the Shopify store?, HEY NO PROBLEM :)\\n\\nMy favorite Canada Nats memory was probalby going to Montreal. That was unreal! Just the whole trip and meeting all of the yoyoers I never met before there ;) Then going out for food after with everyone in such a magical city. That was a blast.\\n\\nProbably another memory was in 2011 when Ed came up and yoyoed with Dick Moffat on stage. That was pretty magical. http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0266/8037/t/2/assets/blog_dick-moffat-demo-sm.jpg?1159, ariven mentioned some good ones. we too like  \\'Product Reviews\\', \\'Bulk Discounts\\', and \\'Vantage\\'.\\nI would also recommend \\'Metafields Editor\\' by Webify Technology especially when coupled with the Shopify related products snippets ([Shopify manual](https://docs.shopify.com/support/your-store/products/can-i-recommend-related-products) ) it\\'s a bit of manual work but well worth it to keep your product pages from becoming dead-ends.\\n\\'Live Web Insights\\' by Yahoo was quite fun when we started, it shows you live visitor insights - but be warned it can be quite addictive!, Well no, the point my point was that demeanor and aggressive body language are what are threatening. Which of these people would you feel more comfortable standing next to, and why?\\n\\n[This guy]( http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0101/8362/products/141112_OkayPlayer5228.jpg?v=1416194476)\\n\\n[Or these guys]( http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/neo-nazis-in-Ukraine.jpg)\\n\\nEdit: I see what you\\'re saying, though. There is a bias against people who act or dress in a particular manner, even if it\\'s not necessarily threatening, and that bias can be reinforced by skin color. Racism is feeling threatened by the black guy in the white tshirt simply because he\\'s black., Do u have an instagram account? The links on the site take me to Shopify.\\nLooks like a great product! Keep up the good work., *Niamh stands at the edge of the water [in a bikini](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0162/0448/products/bobl_grande.jpg?v=1361480108), looking in and biting her lip nervously.*, I can see that. I have a carousel snippet that can be displayed instead. Once I start doing some advertising I hope to try two versions and see which has a lower bounce rate.  \\n  \\nI did submit to the theme store and got a canned response about it not meeting Shopify\\'s aesthetic standards. I think that means it needs to be more artsy, but who knows., Yeah, there\\'s no option in Shopify to stack coupons. Unfortunately we can\\'t offer 15% off the bomber, and then knock off another 10% off. \\n\\nIf you wanna get the l/s too I can hook it up with 10% off + free shipping. Feel free to shoot me a PM, 1. Sell other people\\'s shirt to see what is selling or to know if you know how to sell... Go to sunfrog.com, you don\\'t need a designer, you could sell other people\\'s design.\\n2. If you are confident that you have a design that would sell, ask a designer to do it for you or design it yourself.\\n3. Post to teespring, zazzle etc.\\n4. Market it to facebook groups, twitter, paid ads.\\n\\n*You could also post it to your website, shopify store and blog. Then use printful.com to print the shirt whenever some buys from you. They will take care of the inventory, you do the design and marketing. Unlike teespring, you don\\'t need to reach a specific goal., Hi, my name is Ivan and I am a web developer. I am currently focusing on customizing and selling themes for Shopify online stores. Check out my latest work at [caspian-theme.myshopify.com](http://caspian-theme.myshopify.com)., http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0301/9933/products/will_grande.jpg?v=1428078544, Packed Pixels, they can be bought [here](http://dovetail-technology.myshopify.com/collections/all)., &gt; Tiffany\\'s seems to have a ton of options.\\n\\nMy two favorite necklaces are from Tiffany.  The first one is a Frank Gehry-designed 3D torque cube necklace I got for my birthday a few years ago (I later bought the more common 2D torque square necklace...I sometimes wear them together).  It was limited edition, so it\\'s hard to find now (see: https://thealzblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/4_frank-gehry-torque-open-pendant_7-gorgeous-jewelry-collections-by-frank-gehry-for-tiffany.jpg)\\n\\nThe other necklace is one of my go-to, everyday necklaces: a single \"barrel\" necklace like this:  \\n\\nhttp://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0258/4165/products/T2eC16FHJHwE9n8igs_oBP54CB6fPg_60_1_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1376776148\\n\\nNeither of them has the Tiffany &amp; Co logo (I hate logos and refuse to be a human billboard).   They\\'re all very \"me\", very geometric (I\\'m a physicist and love geometry, hence my love for Tiffany\\'s Frank Gehry collection).  \\n\\nA quick final note: You can buy used Tiffany pieces on eBay relatively cheaply, but there _are_ counterfeits of the more common pieces, e.g., the \"Return To Tiffany\" stuff that\\'s popular.  Fortunately for me, counterfeiters don\\'t seem interested in the stuff I prefer.\\n\\nETA:  Tiffany\\'s sterling silver doesn\\'t seem to tarnish nearly as quickly as other silver I\\'ve bought.  I\\'m not sure how or why, but I never seem to need to polish any of my Tiffany items.\\n, Arda is usually my first recommendation for wigs, but they just had a sale and are almost totally out of stock. IF they restock soon, then their shipping times are very reasonable even for your time frame and price. Hope that makes sense. It looks like a [whooole mess of wigs will be available in another week or two](http://arda-wigs.com/pages/restock).\\n\\nI\\'m not familiar with the character but Google tells me you\\'re looking for shoulder length pretty voluminous blonde with straight bangs. \\n\\nIf they restock soonish, I highly recommend [Arda\\'s Inigo](http://arda-wigs.com/products/inigo) in your [preferred shade of blonde.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0121/6592/files/Blondes_redux.jpg?2992) It looks like Lemon Drop is still in stock at the time of writing, but that may well be too yellow to look good on you-- I know I don\\'t look good in anything that isn\\'t really ashy. This is what I did with [Inigo in Ash Blonde](http://40.media.tumblr.com/7e0afd45c56fcc6d6b9eb45f13d6de0f/tumblr_mj4dknClGC1qmimluo1_1280.jpg).\\n\\n[EpicCosplay](https://www.epiccosplay.com/shop-by-wig-color/blonde-mix-wig/) is also often highly recommended, but I just don\\'t think their fibers look as natural as Arda\\'s. That\\'s personal though. I have no experience with their shipping times.\\n\\nEdit: More on short Arda wigs: \\n[This](http://imgur.com/TMkiHVo) was one of my Inigos, directly out of the bag. You can see that it has quite a flip, and it makes me look too pink, that\\'s why I switched to Ash.\\n\\n[Pippin](http://arda-wigs.com/products/pippin) would probably suit your needs too. I don\\'t have one, but the difference between it and Inigo seems to be that Pippin has a skin top and Inigo has densely packed crepe hair at the base, making Pippin look more natural if you have a part, and Inigo fluffier. The ironed-in part on Pippin might be annoying to try to get rid of, but if you put the wig on a stand and pour near boiling water over it it\\'ll probably straighten out pretty well. Ardas are strongly heat resistant which is part of why I like them--you\\'ll be able to style and restyle your wig for any other blonde in your future. Pippin also looks like it will arrive stick-straight, while Inigo will arrive with a gentle wave verging on a flip at the bottom. \\n\\nAccording to the character sheet I saw, the blue on the feet is supposed to look like the rubber sides and toe of Chuck Taylors. I\\'ve seen people imitating it with turquoise ballet flats. If you must paint a shoe, DON\\'T get vinyl! Nothing sticks to vinyl. Nothing. Get some basic white fabric flats and water down your fabric paint so that it seeps into the fiber instead of sitting on top. You\\'ll lose the rubber \"Chucks\" look with a fabric shoe but it\\'s such a minor detail I wouldn\\'t worry about it especially on your first costume. \\n\\nMany [natural blondes](http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/37800000/Cinderella-Facebook-Profile-Picture-cinderella-2015-37820063-800-800.jpg) have dark brows, I wouldn\\'t worry about that too much, just make sure they\\'re well groomed. , [deleted], Very nice watch !\\n\\nI love black-dialled watches, so i just felt in love with the [Seiko SARG017J](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0243/0993/products/sarg017-a_large.jpg?v=1410423169)\\n\\nThank you for your post !, Try to invest those 100$ in shopify  http://www.shopify.com/pricing - You should also buy a domain!

Im not sure if woocommerce is open but its easy and works well for most cases. If you just want to sell stuff shopify and bigcommerce are eveb easier. If you are looking for an expensive difficult and powerful solution then Magento is worth a look. I use Joomla and Hikashop because my needs cant be met by other solutions at this time. , I\\'ve looked into building a shopify website, and will probably do something along those lines using WooCommerce.\\n\\nI really want to build the brand and get my name out there, but I don\\'t know where to start!, I second this. Start from setting up a store on shopify. Plus you can setup facebook/twitter/instagram pages/accounts. You can post pictures of your products, price and how to order. A lot of people are doing this. Ask your friends to spread it, contact influential people to promote it for free. 99% will refuse but still worth a try. You can also offer free merchandise to popular twitter account holders for promoting your store. , There\\'s also VendPOS, which is similar. Ultimately, we switched eCommerce platforms (from Magento) to Shopify for the POS system, though. The integration and support of the POS and site far outweighed any negatives of the system. , Wicked, that\\'s what I\\'ll do then, I\\'ll do it through shopify and use a drop shipper then. And try and grow the pages to reach a wider audience.. Do you know any good guides or articles on how to grow your audience through social media?, [Good News](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bfN%2BPBYnL.jpg), Night on the Sun [vinyl](http://www.interstate-8.com/images/releases/nots2.jpg) or [Japan CD](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdv07klit61rboahqo1_cover.png) , [BNOOS](http://www.wosound.com/images/buildingsomething.jpg) , [Baron von Bullshit](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YZfM7BI4L.jpg) , [TM&amp;A remaster](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/34/MMMoonandAntarcticaRe.jpg) , [Too Many Fiestas single](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/5432/products/GP709_cover_ec458bc2-cd94-42ce-9076-5f716bdb4f43_1024x1024.jpg) , and the [Ocean Breathes Salty single](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f5/OBSalty.jpg) are my favorite covers.

I\\'m going to be blunt, but please don\\'t mistake it for being rude. I\\'m here to help. \\n\\nYou aren\\'t going to find a solution that does this well out-of-the-box. If you don\\'t know how or where to get started, it means that you need to hire someone (like a technical cofounder) who does know where to get started, or commit to learning to program yourself. Something like a \"marketplace\" varies so wildly even in the examples you provided that one solution will never fit for all possibilities. Etsy and eBay are both marketplaces, but they are not the slightest bit similar. \\n\\nMy advice, if you have a solid niche and a good business plan for your marketplace idea, is to find someone to help you. This is a big task that cannot be solved with a Shopify or a Magento. Good luck with your search. , Check out this thread:\\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/3170e0/squarespace_vs_shopify_which_are_you_using_and_why/, Sounds yummy! I\\'ll buy some for bits when possible. Considered Shopify?, Since this is a huge question that one comment can\\'t hope to answer, I\\'m going to refer you to [Shopify\\'s How to Start a Business guides](http://www.shopify.com/blog/tagged/how-to-start-a-business). \\n\\nYou basically have two choices here: sell something that no one is selling, or sell something that other people are selling but in a vastly superior way. This is the key point to being successful. \\n\\nRemember that ecommerce software is merely a means to an end - don\\'t get caught up in a hypothetical this system vs. that one when you haven\\'t tried any yet. Give them all a spin - Shopify, PrestaShop, Magento, WooCommerce, and many, many more have demos or open source repositories for you to be able to evaluate on your own. If one of them seems to make sense for you, then choose that one and move along. You\\'re building a business, not an ecommerce store. \\n\\nTest your idea on as many people as will listen. This is important! You might think you\\'ve got a rock-solid idea, and if you do, that\\'s awesome. But make sure you\\'re not the only one who thinks so. Test, test, test. Then test some more. \\n\\nBranding and marketing are so important! Look at Dollar Shave Club - they took something that is sold almost everywhere, and made it super awesome. That\\'s a pretty good example of doing something vastly superior (and possibly different) to their competitors. \\n\\nHere\\'s the bottom line: Once you setup your store, you aren\\'t done. You haven\\'t even started. Have fun, good luck, and be prepared to fail early and fail often. Don\\'t give up on yourself, but don\\'t be afraid to give up on an idea if it isn\\'t going to work, regardless of how much work you\\'ve already put in. As long as you\\'re always working and always learning, you\\'re not truly failing. This is a long, difficult, exciting road!, Hello, \\nGood to hear from you!\\n\\nAre you saying we can use shopify to sell in squarespace with BTC? Im googling this right now..\\n\\nPs.

If you have a lot of products/images to import, this can be a pretty big pain point unfortunately. This isn\\'t specific to Shopify however, importing large quantities of data on any platform can be time consuming and cumbersome. \\n\\nDepending on how your data setup, you may be able to automate this using the API as I stated above. This would need to be evaluated on a case by case basis and will require programming knowledge. , This is the \\'study\\'\\n\\nhttp://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0245/4693/files/Aminolase_Clinical_Study.pdf?4215, Why not use Shopify? I come from a ecommerce background, and working with shopify it makes me wonder why not many are considering it for a restaurant/food delivery. It could also combine your POS with a online food order website., Squarespace is beautiful to work with but extremely limited in options to expand and integrate with other platforms.\\n\\nShopify is equally great to work with in terms of design, but you\\'ll have a vast array of integrations to handle any small or medium business needs. \\n\\nIt\\'s important that you GROW with the right platform. Otherwise you\\'ll be stuck moving information from one platform to another., As a business owner of go with the cheaper option for now. Yes, a lot of developers may chide you on your decision to not go wp, magento, etc etc, but you can set a goal for those things later if you need it. The rub is that you\\'ll pay more in transaction fees, but for the first year (unless you have a super hot product) you\\'ll still be saving money. \\n\\nThat all assumes, of course, that the shopify features are what you need. Emphasis on NEED. If your business process requires something to be done in a specific way and shopify can\\'t do that then your options are different. \\n\\n, The only time I\\'ve worked with SquareSpace was with limited admin capabilities on the back end *but* I will say that Shopify has constantly gotten excellent feedback from people who use it. Obviously there are exceptions but if you can swallow the monthly costs then Shopify is likely to take care of all your needs, especially in a simple manner., Oh! Haha it is scary at the beginning. At first you should only learn front carries - the best one to learn first is called the Front Wrap Cross Carry (FWCC). Then once you\\'ve got that sorted, look up some other front carries to play with. THEN, learn some hip carries! The Robbins Hip Carry and the Poppins Hip Carry are pretty cute. \\n\\nFinally, once your baby is at least 6 months old, and you\\'ve been wrapping regularly for a few months (3 months minimum), try some back carries. Back carries should only be done if your baby is 6 months + if you are an inexperienced wrapper because you need to make sure the baby\\'s airway is clear (and this can only be done if the baby can hold their head up/sit independently, and you can get them high enough on your back to be able to see them if you turn your head). When you do finally learn back carries, learn them standing next to your bed so that if you fuck it up you can lean backwards/crouch and gently put your baby on the bed. I also used my husband as a spotter so I didn\\'t accidentally flip my baby forwards over my shoulders haha.\\n\\nDefinitely watch a few videos of FWCC with a newborn and you\\'ll be able to see how the baby doesn\\'t fall out :D\\n\\nIn terms of safety once the baby is actually wrapped onto your body, the main things to remember are the [TICKS guidelines.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0526/3989/files/TICKS_guidelines_for_safe_babywearing.png?2069), I feel like I read the roof of the building shopify is in is open to the public, Basically everything else has the same problem, getting traffic.\\n\\nI\\'ve had items on big cartel, storenvy, and shopify and it just took more time than I wanted to spend to drive traffic when etsy was taking care of itself.

A basic Shopify account can be created quite quickly that\\'s true, but curating products and sourcing images takes a lot longer than that. There is a lot of thought that goes into e-commerce stores, the navigation needs to make sense and the site has to be user-friendly etc. I just wanted to share the site to get some friendly early-stage feedback, Shopify does, I made the mistake of opening our stores on Big commerce about a year ago.  They recently had a 4 day outage that impacted our stores with zero communication (still!). We\\'re in the process of moving our stores to Shopify and from what I can tell Shopify has a much better back end, customizing HTML is a snap and their application ecosystem is way better. \\n\\nYou\\'d be smart to go with Shopify IMHO, [deleted], I\\'m not sure the comparison makes sense. WooCommerce and Shopify both have free themes you can use with the option of spending $6,500+ on a fully customized website.

I mean, using your example, if you\\'re normally doing websites for $500, it\\'s sure good to know Steve can do it for $50.  But the problem is, there will ***always*** be someone doing it cheaper.  Now, I\\'m not saying hold firm on prices forever, blindly, and stubbornly.  I mean, I was doing e-comm websites in 1999, and charging at minimum $25,000.   People are getting better solutions from Shopify for a tiny fraction of that today.  Sadly, to keep charging top dollar, we all need to stay competitive and ahead of the curve.  But, resist the urge to discount simply \\'because\\'.  It\\'s a balancing act, I agree.   My biggest fear is the \\'race to the bottom\\'.  If all we ever do is charge less and charge less, and compete on price, it\\'s a no-win game.  My advice, is to hold firm on your prices, but constantly ensure you\\'re delivering value.  And more value than you did last year. , If you\\'re going for Chinese traffic, sure, but otherwise I wouldn\\'t bother. SEO for Baidu works a lot differently than Google/NA search engines.

I feel bad telling her to stop because I know she means well, but I really don\\'t want or need all the extra crap or clothes. Every time she visits she brings a carload of random stuff. This time it was curtains. My SO and I have very different tastes for decor than my mom. We have a pretty modern aesthetic, so when my mom purchases [gingham, floor length curtains with matching sashes, lace dividers, and matching top curtain](http://img2.wfrcdn.com/lf/79/hash/12083/9515579/1/Logan%2BGingham%2BCheck%2BPrint%2BWindow%2BTreatment%2BCollection.jpg)...Well... We just wont be using them... She also likes to bring us stuff that isn\\'t worn out or totally broken, but is still old or dated. These things are not sentamental, or valuable in any way and should probly just get donated, but she thinks \"we can use them\" (Think giving to working, but older stuff to college kids in their first apartment. \"we got a new microwave, give the old one to the kids!\") \\n\\nMy so and I are past this point, we can afford to purchace what we want and we really don\\'t want old area rugs from the 90\\'s or old furniture. She also brings decorations for the holidays if she\\'s visiting over them.

The product photos and descriptions are really good.\\n\\nHere are things I would change:\\n\\n1. The header seems to be too big/long. Maybe remove the padding on the top to get more on the screen on the first look. Right now even on a desktop half of the screen is the logo+header menu alone.\\n\\n2. Add more of a \"story\"/manufacturer approach. Right now the frontpage looks very clean, but also pretty cold.

One of the better Shopify setups I\\'ve seen on /r/Entrepreneur\\n\\nI have a few suggestions for you...and this is my experience having worked on 2 clothing brand launches (1 in fitness and 1 social movement/street wear worn by a few big celebs).\\n\\n1 ) Going forward keep your branding consistent across your products.  \\n\\n* The letter \\'e\\' on the Skeptics (official logo in your site header) and the hoodie are different.   \\n* You have a completely different script on a shirt below.  \\n* Another different script font on the baseball jersey (which is probably fine because it\\'s mimicking a baseball jersey).  \\n* A college type serif font on the long sleeve tee.   \\n* A \\'S\\' design that is only seen on one shirt and a hat\\n* A sans-serif font design that says Skeptiks that is only seen on a jacket.\\n\\nKeep your company branding consistent.  Focused.   \\n\\nPersonally I like the (is that Futura Condensed Black?) type on the button up jacket, the \\'S\\' on the hat and shirt, and your official logo that\\'s in the site header.  Why aren\\'t you using that header logo more on your products?\\n\\n2 )  If you\\'re going to use consistent symbols on the chest and sleeves of your shirt use it elsewhere on the site too as part of your branding.  Tell a story with them.  \\n\\n3 )  Up quality of the tshirts.  I can tell in the pictures that the quality of the tshirts that you\\'re printing on are lower.  The cut of the collar and the way that the fabric looks/wrinkles is a dead give away.\\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0827/1591/products/redeem_team_white_l_s_front_grande.jpg?v=1428903561\\n\\nBelieve it or not 100% cotton isn\\'t always what it\\'s cracked up to be.  The $.50 - $1.00 that you\\'ll pay extra for a better blend/cut will make a giant difference.  Plus you\\'ll be able to increase your prices.\\n \\n, Haven\\'t looked at the dendritic structure of 1018, my brother\\'s a blacksmith so we\\'re usually more for the slightly higher carbon content.\\n\\nAnd yes you are being deliberately obtuse, there is no way I can think of that you would imagine that I\\'m implying the SG of wood as a form of its sharpness. \"The material properties\" does not necessarily imply all of them\\n\\nHere, Pretend you have a thing made of anything that looks like this\\n[Belt...thing](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0225/4471/products/CaldeneVShapedBrowband_1024x1024.jpg?v=1387538687)\\n\\nLet us pretend that it is a cross section for a disc-like object. That point, especially if we elongate it and make it thinner will be able to penetrate most things, but as it gets down toward the end, you start having issues of surface area and pressure to deal with. \\n\\nWith steel, every time you sharpen it, say with a stone for example, you\\'re knicking off what are usually flakes, packs of steel crystals, and they\\'re really small, so the surface area they leave you with only has imperfections as small as the crystals. Wood has grain sizes that are visible with the naked eye. When you stone(sand) or file wood, it loses material in the form of exceptionally large fibres. This is the reason sawdust is considerably less dense than the iron filings that build up under a grinder. The imperfections left on the edge will be wider, and they\\'ll end up causing a far greater Coefficient of friction if you DO end up cutting a thing, but on top of that, they\\'re leaving the rest of the \"blade\" unsupported, so the pressure from hitting something will end up pushing the wood back into those holes and troughs, especially right at the edge. The effect on the edge of the edge is to immediately flatten and to begin to actively hinder the blade\\'s passage. The effect on the sides is to rip some of those fibres off and form splinters that act as dragnets through flesh. The blade then stops cutting and thus isn\\'t sharp.\\n\\nI guess it\\'s important to note the sementic aspect I mentioned earlier which requires a sort of Godelian meta. You can, in theory, have a very fine angle at the edge of an incredibly dense wooden (or wood-like structured) blade. But sharpness isn\\'t a measure of an angle, it\\'s the idea of how well something can cut. A single droplet of water can only take off the tiniest speck off a piece of granite, even at horrendously high energies. The trick then is to throw a bunch of droplets at those energies at the granite. This wood *can\\'t conceivably* cut, regardless of the angle it posesses, as well as steel because it immediately deforms and on top of that, it is impossible to get to that angle consistently anyway because of the **properties of the material** those properties being a giant list including how porous it is, the coefficient of friction of the surface on the edge, the coefficient of friction in relation to the pressure being applied to the surface nearest the point, the actual shape of the point, the amount of energy each fibre can stand before it is parted from its neighbours, and the interrelation between those **properties**\\n\\nAnd Potential Sharpness and (by extension) potential roundness can both be measured. It\\'s the reason we didn\\'t use wood to make the most spherical objects on earth. With what Units, I do not know, I\\'m too lazy to google them right now, Not possible., Any idea on the reasoning for that?, This is actually possible - Shopify has recently added the ability to edit the password page of a theme through the password.liquid template file (see https://docs.shopify.com/themes/theme-development/templates/password-liquid).\\n\\nYou can do anything you want with the template, so hooking up a signup form is definitely possible., That\\'s coz that\\'s how shopify works. , &gt; Work has so little to do with it, might as well not be mentioned.\\n\\nWork has almost everything to do with it (if we bracket out lotto winners and those who inherit money), it just has to be work directed the right way, and is still governed by the possibility of failure, which idiots mistake as the result being complete luck.

Shopify is what he wants to build but is not what is used to build it.\\n\\nAlso what the dude is asking is easily a huge undertaking and should have a team of developers.  Not one person.\\n\\nDon\\'t go with wordpress, it\\'s not an ecommerce platform.  I would probably go with Prestashop or Magento but even then that\\'s iffy.  Prestashop I know allows multiple stores but it assumes the admin controls all of them.  It\\'s also not very scalable on that front.  Magento is a beast and may have a module but still, not scalable.\\n\\nYou\\'d probably want to make it from scratch with a framework like Laraval, Yii, or Symfony., Worked perfect!  embedded Mail Chimp and the password page now is a landing page!, http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0034/2402/products/RD-Africans-5_Resized.jpg?v=1372258849, https://homestore-runner.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/compy-iphone-case, The code worked. I didn\\'t see it say anywhere on their main page that it was restricted to a specific brand. They claimed that they couldn\\'t restrict coupons because Shopify doesn\\'t work that way (I guess that is who does the tech side of their online store). They also insisted that I had to have seen the restriction (which I did not). They were very rude., They\\'re definitely growing fast (I think revenue has doubled each year for the past two years). They\\'re not profitable, though. They\\'ve been reinvesting their earnings into the business... probably a very good thing! This, along with information problems, may make it seem like this is a bit early. A profitable business can surely get a higher price for their shares when going public, allowing them to raise more capital in the IPO. Also, being a smaller business, Shopify isn\\'t extremely well known. This will have a negative effect on the price they\\'ll get per share as well. I\\'m sure there\\'s plenty more advantages/disadvantages of going public now. All this being said,  I think 100M is ~10% of their business. , If you\\'re just starting out then I would definitely recommend shopify as a platform, it has some good themes and you have a lot of room for customisation if you have some developer experience (or you can just learn along the way like what happened to me). There\\'s plenty of resources on adding features etc and their support is usually quite good. Happy to share more on my shopify experience via PM, all the best., You can buy it [here](https://homestore-runner.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/compy-iphone-case)., In my opinion, I feel like the Shopify store and promoting via pinterest/instagram/fb is the way to go for women\\'s clothes. I see a ton of stores on these platforms, especially instagram that are killing it because they have models wearing the clothes and are using popular tags that girls look for.\\n\\nAmazon is obviously huge and has a lot of eyeballs, but it would probably depend on what you are selling. Also, clothing is a gated category by amazon and you need approval, [If](http://i.imgur.com/7Ff8XM2.jpg) [I](http://new4.fjcdn.com/comments/Gabe+is+love+gabe+is+life+_5bccb1463b549b686177347f8d3958e7.jpg) [Knew](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/397/538/be6.jpg) [Anything](http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/gaben2.jpg) [About](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0290/8145/products/c18b08e0-a927-11e3-aa35-7be89e88daad.jpg?v=1394547398) [PCMR](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18hz9lsj30v5ipng/original.png) [I](http://new1.fjcdn.com/comments/The+new+valve+glados+external+hard+drive+get+a+free+hat+_f9a799e2bc96dad20edce1aa31a5c1b5.jpg) [Would](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18hzc1fhoy6q2png/original.png) [Post](http://pulp365.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/pc-gaming-master-race-gaben.jpg) [GabeN!](http://gamesforchange.org/festival2011/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Gabe_01.jpg), :) yeah, performance will probably not be a selling point of this... the goal is really to have a smart solution for internationalization when a proper solution isn\\'t available.\\n\\nMy specific case is a Shopify store, did you ever know that they don\\'t provide i18n support at all for their sites? The horror, specially coming from a Canadian company... oh well, Rob,\\n\\nIt is my personal opinion that you need to look at the motivation behind the add-to-cart action and make changes based upon those. Simply getting people to add to cart and pushing abandonments to the next step won\\'t help. The way to compel someone to add to cart, is to compel them to buy. It\\'s less about usability than you think.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that it\\'s amazing what people will do and the hoops they\\'ll go through if they want to buy your product. Unless your site is so bad and doesn\\'t meet the minimum \\'usability threshold\\', which I doubt given you\\'re using Shopify... I would focus on two areas outside of my previous post:\\n\\n- reducing bounce rate on the landing page (home page, or whatever the first page is) \\n\\n- optimizing people that add to cart.\\n\\nThese represent the two ends of the funnel that are actually the low hanging fruit. Without your analytics its harder to get into more detail, but I\\'m happy to help in any way I can. We do this for more established sites, but upstarts are even more fun. It\\'s a blue ocean. , Nice guide! The ECCC variant was recently added to Oni Press\\'s [online store](http://oni-press.myshopify.com/collections/new-releases/products/rick-and-morty-1-eccc-variant). Unfortunately it only ships inside the United States., Yeah, the sample size is still too small and the data still too volatile to read much into the actual analytics figures quite yet. And there\\'s no sense ramping up the advertising until I\\'m at least 90% comfortable with the full funnel, from landing page to product delivery. \\n\\nRight now, customers bouncing out of cart hasn\\'t been a significant problem (as you say, Shopify does a pretty good job there). But getting customers into the cart has been the bigger challenge, hence my current focus.\\n\\nBut the anecdotal news today is good on all fronts. Of the 16 paid visitors who showed up at the site, 7 stuck around and explored the site, 1 added to cart and that same 1 also completed his purchase. If I could do those percentages every day, that would be pretty impressive. We\\'ll see how the numbers shake out over time. ;o) , So great to read about another person in my shoes! I\\'ve taken the exact same steps as you have outlined above for my upcoming tshirt line (Planning to use shopify, Printful &amp; Facebook ads). Kudos on you for doing your research, I\\'m 23 so I\\'m quite impressed at how enterprising you are. In regards to question 4 my advice would be to start building a followership on  Tumblr/Twitter/Instagram. On Twitter especially there is a plethora of \"teenage girl\" typical girl\" \"average goals\" \"relationship goals\" accounts that have a huge followership so I can imagine you will reach a good number of teens &amp; young adults if one of those accounts retweets your stuff. Twitter does have a lot of spam bots unfortunately but certainly start with the free social media platformsbefore using paid ads. It will take some time to build some followers but it will be worth it, Let\\'s be honest, your *fiancée* (and about 90% of women I know) believe they are \"really good\" when it comes to women\\'s clothing.  And usually it\\'s because they spend so much time buying shit from stores they conclude that buying a ton of shit somehow makes them an expert.  Unfortunately, consuming a ton of sushi does not qualify one to start as a chef in Morimoto\\'s.  As JBob said, it\\'s an overcrowded and competitive market because it\\'s literally the default women\\'s business idea if you asked them to think up a business idea... the same as if you asked a college student for a business idea 90% of them would come up with a plan to sell T-shirts or trade in college books.\\n\\nThe best way to test if your fiancée has the chops to grow a fashion line is to start on Etsy and do some marketing with that small shop.  Feel free to explore starting a blog, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, FB, Snapchat, etc. for her marketing channels... the more marketing channels the better.  Again, literally hundreds of thousands of women try this and never scale because so many of them do it.  If her Etsy takes off, scale to a Shopify/AZ platform and go from there... it\\'ll be a good problem to have.\\n\\nClothing/Fashion done at volume is entirely about marketing.  In case you didn\\'t read that, it\\'s literally all about marketing.  It\\'s not hard to find or make unique things to sell, or even hard to find good deals... In fact, when you jack up the price on fashion items, it makes people more likely to buy them.  What\\'s hard is trying to stand out among the hundreds of thousands of other future Guccis, Pradas, and Ralph Laurens all trying to get the snowball of popularity rolling on their product.  The more niche-y she can get, the better., Shopify?, Have their info shoot over to an online payment processer.\\n\\nIn all honesty though, I\\'d probably just use shopify or something similar because it\\'s simple and easy. Or if it absolutely has to be in .Net and I\\'m feeling lazy, I\\'d probably use something like [this](http://www.nopcommerce.com)., This is a very poorly informed comment.\\n\\nMerchant Solutions revenue consists primarily of Shopify Payments (SP) transaction fees. Merchant Solutions costs are predominantly fees paid to SP\\'s underlying credit card processor. Those are variable costs linked to the volume of transactions processed. What you\\'re seeing is very likely the onboarding of high-volume merchants to SP with low-margin agreements.\\n\\nTo really understand the business, examine the changes in sales efficiency of the subscription business from period to period: (Sub Revenue * Sub Gross Margin) / Sales and Marketing Expense\\n\\nWithout access to changes in quarterly subscribers, sales efficiency the next best option for understanding if they have an effective and efficient growth strategy.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I worked at Shopify for a while., [deleted], u def. had few good points. thanks for the productive criticism. also your question about the licorice haters. good point.\\nu gotta store aswell?, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0273/6707/products/Chairborne_2_2048x2048.jpg, Shopify, [For white people](http://www.feitdirect.com/products/hand-sewn-high-naturale) [.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0192/8282/products/superclean-hi-toscano-natural-02-web_1024x1024.jpg?v=1415898779)\\n\\n[For black people](http://www.feitdirect.com/products/pntha-hi-black) [.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0192/8282/products/pntha_black_3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1415850705), Research shopify and how it works, and pitch it to him, you will still have to set it up, code custom things, and make a responsive and well designed theme. It\\'s still a lot of work. Don\\'t even try to make a full ecommerce site from scratch, don\\'t reinvent the wheel, you\\'ll suffer lol. , We partner with websites to include the functionality directly onto their site through a script include and site plugins (Wordpress, shopify, etc).  We also have a way of linking that image to pleenq.com that lets the users share content without requiring an extension download.\\n\\nSign up for the beta (which will come out in two weeks) and try it out.  I think you\\'ll see that our focus on only enhancing a user\\'s browsing experience and never taking away from it is something that brings a lot of value to websites that add the functionality to them.\\n\\nA great use case is that we\\'re integrating with a set of crafting blogs that want to use it to tell you what the ingredients in their DIY projects for each of the parts of the output product is.  So, imagine you highlighted a paper cutout, and linked it to the paper used, the dyes used, and the special tools to cut it.\\n\\nAll of these things promote the download of the extension, so that users can use that functionality outside of that blog, product page, etc., http://noveltypantscompany.myshopify.com/\\n\\nI successfully launched my novelty pants company.\\n\\nMy target audience is redditors.

It does seem like there will be some learning curve, from what I now so far this project would likely be done in iterations which should give me time to get up to speed. Once I know the exact requirements then either Shopify or Magento will be my goto. , Every season they have a new collection. [Saigon Cowboy](http://misterfreedom.com/saigon-cowboy.html) and [The Sportsman](http://misterfreedom.com/the-sportsman.html) is the latest for spring/summer. \\n\\nI was thinking about getting this [W+H souvenir jacket](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0161/7586/products/0X5A2240_1024x1024.jpg?v=1425406724) or the [Indigo BDU jacket](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0161/7586/products/0X5A2509_1024x1024.jpg?v=1427829705). I\\'m not sure which one I want more. I already have a couple of flight jackets, but I really like that souvenir jacket., Get these quick!  Currently I only have the 4 boxes on shopify - so if that\\'s all I get, there\\'s only like 30 sleeves left!  \\n\\nEDIT: added the additional boxes., I really like the Saigon Cowboy stuff too. If you don\\'t already, you should follow [Christophe Loiron](https://instagram.com/christopheloiron/) on Instagram. \\n\\nI was leaning towards that too. I like the [field jacket](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0161/7586/products/0X5A4258_1024x1024.jpg?v=1423174941) too, but I\\'m waiting for [this](https://instagram.com/p/yNXk0tGb3O/) FW version., [Relevant t-shirt](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/0022/products/United-States-of-Film_Blue_DESIGN_1024x1024.jpg?v=1425620839), Some quick thoughts: I\\'m also confused by the concept of the store, are you just trying to be cynical of liquorice but secretly love the sweet?\\n\\n**On product descriptions:**\\nI appreciate the humour you are trying to bring in your product descriptions, but consider shortening them as they are quite long monologues and very few will bother reading down to the actually useful parts. Consider maybe splitting the info into relevant tabs e.g. STORY, CHARACTERISTICS, SHIPPING [example](http://uprosa.com/products/iphone-5c-case-chromatographic-paper-blue?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=comment&amp;utm_campaign=reddit)\\n\\n**Shipping page: Typo**\\nbelow vs bellow\\n\\n**General - Currency:**\\nAlso who is your main target with this store? If you are based in Germany and most of your customers are European, why not display prices in euros? I am based in the UK and I see $. I know that Shopify has a method of implementing a currency converter but I haven\\'t tried it myself yet: [Shopify manual](https://docs.shopify.com/manual/configuration/store-customization/currencies-and-translations/currencies/how-to-show-multiple-currencies)\\n\\n**General:**\\nConsider adding a few more basic pages like an \"About Us\" and \"FAQ/Help\"\\n\\nBest of luck!, It comes down to whether this is a hobby or a business, completely different set of dynamics. Shopify is about time and directly proportionate to resource, it means to grow you need more hours of effort. Almost all of the small business platforms work this way, simply $30-50k to $70-100k revenue per employee. Amazon runs at 30% gross profit margin with 0-5% net profit whereas Net-A-Porter is 67% gross profit. Zalando have 80% returns rate whereas higher grade sites can be as low as 20%. So it\\'s all about where you want to position the store, the top 5% of sites generate 50% of all online revenue, that\\'s very different from being in the other 95% where it is very competitive. If you are looking for a top 1% solution we can refer your business plan to Consortium (sia.consortiuminter.net/boutique), otherwise Shopify is usually a good place to start as it has the best overall structure for niche sites.\\n\\nIn the 1% the customer chases you as you have trust, quality, and volume. In the 95% it\\'s about chasing the customer and that\\'s where the marketing comments come in, however being in the 1% is more about revenue &amp; automation and less about customer interaction, niche is about lower revenue but increased customer service. What you really want is an automated revenue generator and niche personal touch to compliment it, we do that via SIA but they are very selective about who they work with, well wouldn\\'t be in the 1% otherwise., Awesome! Glad you got it up and running :)., Hey there!\\n\\nThe requirements you\\'ve listed are only for developers who\\'d like to submit and sell their themes on the Shopify Theme Store.\\n\\nIf you\\'re building a theme for your own use, you can do pretty much whatever you like :)., I don\\'t really want to show it off necessarily, and I think the black duffle looks [dope](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0624/0605/products/filson_medium_duffle_bag_black.jpg?v=1412915241) \\n\\nOlive would look good, too. , What are you trying to do exactly? Are you trying to sell products? Shopify lets you set up a store front, collect CC, ship stuff etc, Jekyll http://jekyllrb.com/ It uses a flatfile markdown based data set organized like posts, and uses Ruby\\'s Liquid Template Engine (developed by Shopify) and lets you compile out a flat html site based on all the data.  It\\'s perfect for distributable documentation for any software and really simple blogs \\n\\nFor everything else, there\\'s DokuWiki (PHP) or Confluence (Java), Dang, it seems that every online nutritional listing is different from the one on my bag. What the heck? I\\'m going to contact them.\\n\\nI have made my own parmesan chips. Definitely excellent. :)\\n\\nUPDATE: I just called them, and they said that my bag is from a batch of their old recipe, but they\\'ve since [tweaked the recipe](https://coco-roons.myshopify.com/collections/snip-chips/products/snip-chips-cheezy-herb-truffle) and changed the packaging. More sugar, more carbs... Definitely no longer an option. , Thats an alright list, but I would like to make a few suggestions.\\nReplace every plastic cup/utencil/plate/bowl with **one** bowl, **one** sealable cup (I like mason jars), and **one** set of utencils. I prefer chopsticks. Go chopsticks. Also if you can get a cup/jar/bowl that has a handle on it, this is really useful. Get a [carabiner to attach your cup to your belt or pack.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0607/0325/products/lifestyle_pint_6150e84a-4eb1-4864-8efd-08ed4b0fce2b.jpg?v=1414793726)\\n\\n Also, **fuck glow sticks.** Get yourself [a cool light or something instead.](http://www.flowtoys.com/poi/glowstickingpoi/) There are a million to chose from. \\n\\nInstead of fold up chairs, which can be a pain to carry, I would suggest a few sheets and blankets laid out ontop of a tarp to create a floor space for people to sit. Throw in a bean bag chair and a few pillows, and you\\'ve got yourself a nice cuddle puddle space. \\nI\\'ve got to go, but I\\'d be happy to add more later. Happy travels!\\n, &gt; I dont have a web developer on my staff.\\n\\nDefinitely not Magento. Shopify seems to be doing really well these days., Totally agree about keeping both stores open.\\n\\nYou definitely don\\'t want to put all your eggs in the eBay basket. You\\'re building a business on \"rented land\" so to speak, which introduces a lot of risk.\\n\\nIf you were just starting, I would say it\\'s okay to just focus on your Shopify store (which is your website, which is \"owned\"). But, if you\\'re already successful on eBay, why stop?\\n\\nEach channel has its distinct advantages. On eBay you are able to reach a much broader audience, which you can possibly up-sell or turn into repeat customers on your new webstore. With your Shopify store, you have control over branding and can create a more \"you\" user experience. You can also leverage SEO and paid search/advertising strategies to bring in more people.\\n\\nDo NOT feel like you have to choose one or the other. The best way to grow your business is likely by using both.\\n\\nShameless Plug: If you need help, let us know...\\nhttps://www.nchannel.com/pages/shopify-ebay-integration/, Here\\'s a [PDF ad](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0569/8241/files/s1.pdf?14159862164944750963) from a market that\\'s walking distance from me.  I think everything here is insanely cheap, that\\'s likely due to living in southern California though.\\n, It\\'s shopify.  You can even accept Bitcoin!  :), Shopify IME is a dog compared to Magento.\\n\\nMagento Go is being discontinued.\\n\\nSo that leaves Magento Commerce.\\n\\nIf you are really expecting good demand for your brand or your products, though, you\\'ll want to look at Magento Enterprise.  Fortunately, migrating from Commerce to Enterprise isn\\'t too painful, so you can start small and grow later if and when the need arises., Well in my opinion (im a guy), I like labels that are more interesting and exciting looking. makes me more likey to try that flavor out.\\n[unicorns milk](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0234/0165/products/unicornmilk.jpg?v=1395984894) has a really boring label, and I probably never would have bought that juice except someone recommended it to me, From what it looks like on the website, the AIWB have the plastic clips. The standard IWB has dual metal clips.  [Check out this picture](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0173/8620/products/single_single_mag_holder_2048x2048.jpg).  I\\'d never go for the 3 rounder, it just looks too big.  I\\'m mostly leaning single, because I\\'ve only got 1 spare 8 rounder.  I keep telling myself I\\'ll get the grip extension for the 7 rounder, but haven\\'t.  My ProTac 2AAA sits in my right pocket next to my knife, so I don\\'t really need the flashlight portion. , Have you looked at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)?, Except for the checkout, right? That part is dificult to customize from what I\\'ve read online., Magento Go IS discontinued.  At first they pushed people to a combination of BigCommerce, Pixafy and Llama Commerce.  The latter two being just more Magento SaaS but run by other people.  Now they are pushing small business to Pixafy.  Llama commerce is now Nucleus Commerce.\\n\\nThere\\'s no need to look at Magento EE. \\nSource: [The Harsh Truth of Magento Enterprise, Tim Bezhashvyly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrxq8EH5jUU)\\n\\nIf you have specific requirements that are unusual and require some customization then Magento is probably your best choice.  Otherwise if you\\'re small to medium size and fit into the usual ecommerce mold then Shopify is a good choice.  They are really hard to beat, especially on support., I agree, Shopify or one of their competitors is the way to go.  No programming, will look good and work out of the box, no security issues and low cost., Check out shopify like /u/free_willy99 mentioned. Sounds like it will fit your needs best. , Just to add on to this a little, MagentoGO is coming back in another goofy form under ebay/magento called \"[Small Business](http://smallbusiness.magento.com/)\" and I expect about as much from it as MagentoGo. Small Business is there to really promote Pixafy. So if the op doesn\\'t like packing his whole virtual store up and taking the trail of tears back off of the platform like so many other MagentoGo customers did when they discontinued it, he should probably just stick with Magento Commerce. I\\'m sure they\\'ll be hyping it at Imagine.\\n\\nThe rules don\\'t ask me to, but for disclosure purposes I should mention that I work for a Magento hosting provider. \\n\\nOP, take care in your choice. I see people facing the reality of separating bad hosts and bad platforms. Sometimes if they are on pixafy/Bigcommerce/shopify, they have to go through a platform migration as well as a hosting migration. If you switch to Magento CE, you aren\\'t bound to any specific host or any specific developer. There are niche specialty hosts like my company that focus on things like performance and optimization, and others that focus on geographic availability. Alternatively, you could run it on a plain old dedicated server if you have the administrative expertise. Since it\\'s open, there are plenty of hosts and devs to choose from. Going with specialty niche hosts that live and breathe Magento frees up a lot of your time for more productive application. It might surprise you to know that the official hosted platforms like \"magentoGo\" or \"Small Business\" don\\'t always offer you the best administrative or performance expertise, but institutions like that are usually very strict and monolithic when it comes to adapting to industry best practices and progress., I\\'m third\\'n Shopify especially for the e-commerce., The majority of shared hosts aren\\'t PCI compliant.   No clue why people on /r/Entrepreneur continue to encourage people to go the self hosted route.   When in reality you\\'ll need a dedicated server or a PCI complaint shared host.  And I\\'ve had hosts that claim their compliant not pass a PCI scan.   \\n\\nThere are huge implications and fines for non PCI compliance.  Yet I bet the majority of the people dolling out this type of info have never heard those 3 letters in their lives.  \\n\\n(Note: Another self hosted option would be to send your user to a 3rd party processor when they hit checkout.  Which  is not very professional.)\\n\\nGo with Shopify.  It will be cheaper in the long run.  Stripe (if you were to go self hosted) and Shopify have the same exact fees 2.9% and .30 per transaction.  Consider the $29.99 a month charge on Shopify a hosting fee.  \\n\\nAnd just be happy that you won\\'t have to tack on paid module after paid module on to WooCommerce and you won\\'t have to sweat at night every time a new Wordpress exploit hits and you\\'re not PCI compliant until you upgrade.\\n\\nOne last thing:  My long winded answer...I know.   Stripe claims that they make you PCI compliant...but in reality they don\\'t unless you use their pop up payment module/widget. , Thanks for this. I actually have heard of PCI compliance and was involved in dealing with this issue for one of my employers. Good to hear that Shopify deals with this., I made a lot of good money being a PCI consultant for 2 small businesses.  Authorize.net their processor required proof once a year of compliance.\\n\\nIt became such a headache (getting them to use good passwords, moving them to the right servers, fixing exploits, upgrading Wordpress/WP-eCommerce and hoping it didn\\'t break the store each time) that I spent a year convincing both of them to go the hosted route.  Both are on Shopify now and one of them processes more than a million dolllar in sales a year on there.\\n\\nI lost $10k of income (@ $80/hour) a year.  Yet I have no regrets., I would pick Shopify over Squarespace. Either would suit you well though. You can hold off on filing for an LLC until you start seeing moderate - significant income from ads or merch. At that point I would register for an LLC for liability purposes. \\n\\nI\\'m curious about the blog. Can we see it? \\n\\nPS: PM me the link if you\\'re not comfortable posting it here., Those aren\\'t open-backed. That\\'s the closed EL-8, which has a [solid metal back] (https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0362/2465/products/Audeze_EL-8_Planar_Magnetic_Headphones_2.jpg?v=1420909595) rather than the grill of the open EL-8., i found [this hoodie](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0270/9167/products/SH15CMZH2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1415405372) at nordstroms rack in los angeles for 15 bucks in my size. imagine my surprise , I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s supposed to be the teeturtle turtle missed in with the pokemon theme/coloring. Here a [plushie version.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0267/4223/products/RARE-Turtle-Plushie_large.jpg?v=1426306245), A lot of Vendors I noticed are using Shopify. I know TVC uses it as well., [The Canley Cup is going to be getting some heavy usage over the next few weeks.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0209/4636/products/THECUP.jpg?v=1427385889), I am just very wary buying from a shopify especially regarding illegal goods. It adds a layer of tracking for anyone looking and is very obvious what you are doing. , I am in the exact same boat as you.\\n\\nI have seen a lot of companies NOT put the currency beside the price when listing their products online in USD, especially Canadian companies.  I see a HUGE issue with this and it is very deceitful and scammy in my opinion, especially because the exchange rate is very bad right now.  So the customer thinks they are paying $50 when in reality their card is charged $65 (or whatever the exchange rate is that day).   \\n\\nI\\'m guessing you\\'re dealing with the issue of Canadian customers being turned off of your product after knowing/seeing the actual price they will be paying.  \\n\\nI recently was looking into this and you can only process payments using one currency or you will have to create another shop (like what you\\'ve already done).\\n\\nWhat I suggest and what I will also be doing for my own store is having a drop down menu showing the different currencies.  Although the customer will still checkout using the USD price, they will know what the exchange rate is by the drop down menu.

I currently use it for my eCommerce store and it\\'s great. Easy to setup, manage, and customize.\\n\\nI\\'m not exactly sure what you mean by \"provide me with the best commission payouts\".

Here is the list of apps that I couldn\\'t live without.\\n\\n1. Mailchimp for Shopify (Collects the emails of my buyers)\\n2.

You will have to work with collections and tags. It isn\\'t hard to figure out, but it isn\\'t intuitive. , Just to repeat--if you search, you can find Manga Studio brushes all over. There is an account on devArt that gives them away, and you can get a collection of 200+ [here](http://frenden.myshopify.com/collections/manga-studio/products/manga-studio-5-brush-super-set) for $15 US.

I think it looks pretty safe! Looking forward to hearing about your experience. :D, This is interesting to think about because there is not one set way for entrepreneurs to go about their business. \"Entrepreneur\" is quite the loose term. It\\'s easy for me to understand why most people insist that I find an industry that interests me; I don\\'t want to hate what I do. What I\\'m trying to say is that, practically any industry will interest me as long as it\\'s an operation that I have designed. It may not be incredibly successful in the beginning, but sees progress. That\\'s what interests me.

Ascend Acoustics used to partner with Hsu; now they partner with Rythmik - that says it all.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for pure output for the dollar (along with good sound quality as well), I\\'d take a serious look at Reaction Audio: http://reaction-audio.myshopify.com/collections/subwoofers\\n\\nHsu and PSA also make great subs for the money.\\n\\nSVS, IMO, has fallen off from the performance/price race. They still make great subs, however., The original can be found on this [blueprint](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0653/4479/products/WatersPoster2ITEMSHOT_1024x1024.jpg?v=1414720855), I do the same.  Someone wanted me to build them an ecommerce site recently.  I just sent them to shopify and they couldn\\'t be happier.  I normally would have no problem building it for them, but when my schedule is full and their are on a shoestring budget....sometimes Shopify or Squarespace is all they need., You\\'re definitely going to need to get hair removal, whether it be laser or electrolysis. As another reply said, Groupon is a good place to look for affordable laser, just make sure you also read reviews on the place.\\n\\nAs another poster said, makeup may not be working out, but dermablend makes a damn good foundation and concealer that might do a better job for you. Also keep an eye out for concealers with an orange base or an orange tint. Enter Pronoun makes a \"unisex\" makeup line including [a concealer](http://enterpronoun.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/ipsum-ridiculus-porta-2) specifically formulated to be good at covering beard shadow.

(thats what I did for awhile until i had enough.. and then built a website on magento...), I think we all know who the parents are...\\n\\nhttp://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0249/1977/t/2/assets/slide-image-1.jpg?11836815016859533461\\n\\nand its obviously not a kid, its a new cat, FYI - I´ve talked to the support because of the various colors of this stand\\nand most of the pictures are renderings. \\nJust one picture shows an real prototype which is showing the real color of the wood.\\n\\n[http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0046/6182/products/Watch_05_fce9f045-c14e-4c64-b2a6-efb943519944_1024x1024.jpg?v=1426898931], Those would be good... of course it would help to who what your product is to give you true feedback on my thoughts...  Limitedrun is still down and Shopify doesn\\'t include anything about a product., Your idea of the perfect soft-serve cone is dangerously close to the  \"[pile of shit emoji](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/5180/products/Poop_grande.jpg?v=1415395151)\", Also I wouldn\\'t build it from scratch, I\\'d use a platform like Shopify and bill the price of that to them as well. Building your own ecommerce may seem like a good idea, but there are lots of small things that make it very hard, taxes, shipping, billing, transactional records, all that stuff., I\\'m surprised to hear you are unhappy with Bigcommerce. We have a customers who are very happy with it.\\n\\nShopify is probably your next closest option. It\\'s a similar kind of platform, but has just been around longer. It\\'ll have a bigger app selection, just because the community is bigger.\\n\\nThe other alternative I\\'d recommend is Magento (it seems others have too). If you want more development control, Magento will give you that freedom. It\\'s not hosted unless you go with the enterprise plan, but again, you are sacrificing convenience for control. Magento\\'s app ecosystem is huge, and so is its user base., I\\'ve had extensive  conversations with both Brian from Rythmik and Jeremy from Reaction Audio - they are both extremely knowledgeable and provide top notch service; you certainly wouldn\\'t go wrong with either.  What is your room size?  The FV15HP is a beast in every sense of the word, but Reaction Audio\\'s Echo 18 will end up overpowering it just based on brute force: http://reaction-audio.myshopify.com/products/echo-18?variant=1107637857\\n\\nI noticed you  mentioned DIY as well. If you\\'re good with construction, yes, this would provide the most value. I, for one, am not, so alas, I must rely on purchasing a finished product :(\\n\\nRythmik actually supplies DIY kits using their own drivers and amps if you want the sound quality as well as getting more value: http://www.rythmikaudio.com/diy.html, thanks for all this. i was looking at using either shopify or opencart as a base and then working from there. i was going to charge roughly £700-£1000 or do you think thats too much or too little? not really sure to be honest. i was thinking about offering hosting and maintance as well at £15 p/m? thanks, Honestly I used woocommerce before but I use shopify and it has been great thus far. Very simple and easy to use, with a mobile app for payments or checking stock etc. , Hosting is too low I can tell you that. You become the first person they contact when the site\\'s down or they think it\\'s down. Every little problem with the site becomes your problem. Just personal opinion but I don\\'t deal with hosting for this reason. \\n\\nMaintenance should be X hours per month @ your hourly rate with additional hours being billed out. If they don\\'t use X hours, they still pay the flat rate. Have to be careful with this since they could nickel &amp; dime you to death with small changes. Rush changes are always billed as an hour of work even if less time is required. You want them to consolidate their changes instead of doling them out 1 by 1.\\n\\nOpencart itself is fine, the lead developer is a bit of a jerk which turns some people off since he\\'s the primary support for it. Shopify, I don\\'t use it, it should reduce the hosting expenditure but I rather have the ability to host the solution. \\n\\nFar as price, answer the above questions. What level are you providing? With shopify I assume it would be customizing an existing theme, so it\\'s probably within the ballpark. If they have/want a custom design w/ implementing, it\\'s probably a little low. For opencart, same applies.\\n\\nYou\\'re quoting pounds so if you aren\\'t in London or other metro area, the price might be ok. I treat London as being equivalent to NYC or SF in the states. 50/hr in those locales would be too low. But rates and quotes are subject to lots of variables, location, experience, etc. \\n\\nAlso if you\\'re about to be evicted or starve, everything changes drastically right ?, I\\'d highly suggest Shopify, we use it at work for all ecommerce sites and haven\\'t found a better option. It just does everything the best. I\\'m sure open cart is decent as well, but a lot of big companies are using Shopify with great results. , **WARNING: LONG POST AHEAD**\\n\\nHello there!\\n\\nMy partner\\'s cousin will be getting married at the end of this month at the location similar to [this](http://stonesoftheyarravalley.com/wedding/). In the invitation, it was stated that the dress code is formal attire, so when my mom came to visit last month, she actually got me a pretty top ([Front](http://www.sheike.com.au/image/cache/data/products/SUM%2014/28307_F_BLACK-800x1200.jpg) and [Back](http://www.sheike.com.au/image/cache/data/products/SUM%2014/28307_B_BLACK-800x1200.jpg)) and skirt ([Front](http://www.sheike.com.au/image/cache/data/products/TRANS%2015/28551_F_BLACK-800x1200.jpg) and [Back](http://www.sheike.com.au/image/cache/data/products/TRANS%2015/28551_B_BLACK-800x1200.jpg)) for the wedding. I don\\'t know if it makes any sense but the idea of this outfit is that I would tuck the bottom of the top into the skirt and and the entire outfit would actually look like a black tea length dress with the knot at the front of the top showing (like [these](http://imgur.com/a/vGoAq) - sorry for the grainy photos).\\n\\nFor shoes, I will be wearing one of the following pairs of shoes: [these Grey Wedge](https://images.truealliance.com.au/brand/rockport/product/A11842_1_large.jpg) or [these Brown Boots](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0408/1685/products/Bourke_oilybrown_1024x1024.png?v=1422582443). The main reason that I have chosen these two pairs of shoes are because I already own a pair of each. They are really comfortable and I would rather be comfortable for an event like this than be cringing at every step that I have to take.\\n\\nMy current situation is that I really love this outfit and would really like to wear it to the wedding. However, I do have a couple of problems regarding it at the moment:\\n\\n1. I\\'m situated in Melbourne, Australia, and the days are getting colder. The top features thin straps and that would not help me with the cold, so I would like to get a shrug or some form of outerwear to help with that. On top of the cold weather, I am not entirely comfortable with my arms showing and have always preferred to wear tank tops and short sleeved tops with a cardigan of some sort. Would you please help me by suggesting some form of outerwear (i.e. shrugs, cardigan) that I can wear with this without ruining the outfit? It would be great of you could also suggest something that is not black - I\\'m really scared to look as if I am attending a funeral.\\n1. I do not know how to accessorise for an event and outfit like this. Like I\\'ve mentioned, I really do not want to look as if I am attending a funeral instead of a wedding. I do have some accessories but they make the outfit look a lot more casual than I would like.

Okay put it like this... if I alone pass out flyers at a party, cool. I meet people 1 on 1 and talk about it. Great. But now imagine 10 people in a group passing out the same flyers.

A lot of the answers here will revolve around implementation for a larger setup that\\'s more custom, something for a larger company maybe (or even cloning Etsy).\\n\\nThey\\'re all pretty accurate, although if you\\'re just looking for a store, something like Shopify would be great and would allow the person making the items to focus on that instead of all kinds of store/billing/user logic and other hassles.

They are a company thought use Shipedge, a cutting edge software WMS (warehouse management system) that was designed by a company I work for (I am software support specialist). The software allows the customer to keep track of their entire inventory, plus full transparency with the warehouse and fulfillment process as well as integrations with the majority of all selling channels out (Shopify, WooCommerce, FBA, Ebay, etc.). IFS is a great company and has 100s of other clients and I know they run extremely efficient warehouses. I believe they have 4 warehouses, 1 in California, 1 in Utah and 2 in North Carolina. Plus you get some extremely good customer support if you ever need anything. I work at the one in central NC.

It collects issues 1-11. The print run was limited to 1000 copies. The second edition has been solicited and it\\'s going to be 80 dollars cover price, not 100. It\\'s a fucking gorgeous book. I prepaid 90 something for the copy I ordered at my job. This is a *steal*\\n\\n[Here\\'s a link that actually shows you the product you\\'d be buying](http://oni-press.myshopify.com/products/the-sixth-gun-hardcover-gunslinger-edition)\\n\\n, [Electra Omega Prime.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0407/9789/products/omega_prime_ceruse_2048x2048.png?v=1402979576) Best Les Paul clone. , It looks like an out of the box dropshipping website from 2008 (except the design is slightly more modern). What platform are you using to run this site?\\n\\nIf you are using wordpress, opencart etc. I would highly recommend that you buy a theme (say from themeforest such as [this](http://themeforest.net/item/mediacenter-electronics-store-woocommerce-theme/9177409) which is modern, clean and follows the \"online tech shop\" look. If it reminds me of buying from other tech shops then it is good, as opposed to reminding me of a scam website. \\n\\nNOTE: this is just a random theme I found in 1 min search that seemed like it was designed for technology websites. I have no relation to it.\\n\\nI would not buy from you because it feels similar to websites that are scams. Generally when I buy from unknown local NZ sites I check to see if they have a physical address, phone number or give out their email. Those generic contact forms give me no confidence of their being an actual person on the other side.\\n\\nYou also need a better logo in my opinion. It doesn\\'t need to be a masterpiece of creative artwork (your selling gadgets, no one cares if your logo is unique) but you want something that looks good. It can simply be the name written in a good choice of font. With such a simple design brief you should be able to get someone to make you one for $30 - $50 on one of the freelance sites. It won\\'t take them long but they should know what looks good (if you are not confident in your own design abilities).\\n\\nYour product range is strange. Why are you selling some of these things? Do you hold stock or dropship or something? I would narrow it down. If you want to do dash cameras, just do that and increase you SKU\\'s with accessories related to dash cams.\\n\\nAlso because you have so few products (not a bad thing) it looks very empty when navigating through categories and then seeing small pics. With say 10-20 SKU\\'s you can afford to have slightly larger pictures of the products (like the front page of the theme that I linked).\\n\\nDo you really need all that social media? I can\\'t imagine how Pinterest would be beneficial. Keep it to 2-3, and to be honest who want\\'s to like a FB page of a shop like this. Same with twitter, instagram etc. I can\\'t imagine you would have much luck getting active engagement. If you want to advertise on FB or Twitter then it is probably best to get a few likes/follows (either honestly, dishonestly or through a prize competition or something. You don\\'t need many 1-2k likes for a company like yours will be enough to make it look active enough) and then try and drive traffic directly to your website.\\n\\nWhen I ran a small website, almost no one would create an account when buying, so I got rid of that option. People just didn\\'t want to remember another password and have another account on a website they won\\'t be going to all that often.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the advantage of offering Paypal? I mean until you have sales you won\\'t know what people prefer, but my guess is that it will either confuse people, make them click back to try out the different payment options. If you credit card payment is good and easy, it should be fine, although I can understand that Paypal is well known and increases trust (I guess).\\n\\nMy opinion on paying people on freelancing websites to \"improve pagerank, get you to the front page on Google etc\" are risky at best. I did it once and got good results initially (1st or 2nd position for \"mens shirts\" in NZ and a few other searches) but it required constant work or I would just fall off the front page, so I had to keep paying this guy every few months. I payed him twice, and eventually I fell completely off the radar (as if Google\\'s algorithm had determined that whatever got me to the front page was bullshit.)\\n\\nMaybe you need to do some cool driving (on a beach, offroad, on a racetrack,  donuts etc) for your videos because right now they are pretty boring and the way they are named means that they are not going to be found by someone searching on youtube.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Just saw your using Shopify, as I went to the checkout page. Maybe try the Classic theme, or consider buying one. , [quite right](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0185/3344/products/JackLeeCrown-0338-Edit_1024x1024.jpg?v=1428644745), Magento for the last 5 years, moved to shopify. Can\\'t see going back unless magento 3.0 is like amazing. Oh wait 2.0 has been in the works for like 3+ years! , Something about shopify does look more polished. Aren\\'t their templates really pricey though?, Before you go buying anything you need to ensure that you actually have a market for your product. The easiest part of building a business is obtaining the product to sell. It seems daunting now, but trust me, that is the easy part. The hardest part is SELLING the product. Shopify posted an article talking about the best performing companies. Hands down the companies that perform the best are the ones that know who their customers are and have them signed up to buy BEFORE they even launch.

It\\'s great stuff, really. Much easier to stitch with than tiger thread since it\\'s not braided and you won\\'t pass the needle through your threads inside the leather.

Probably setting himself up for a good 6-8+ hours of drinking. Steam Whistle is a good opener because you get free beer with the tour and end up buying yourself a 6 pack on the way out as well (or maybe even [das boot](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0366/5325/products/boot2L_1024x1024.jpg?v=1399987337)).

The head is magnetic so it stays attached to the body., Do you have pictures of the polish? Do you have a logo? Do you have accounts on instagram, twitter, facebook and google? Have you started your marketing yet? Do you have a name for the business and a domain? Once you have all of those, how do you plan on getting people to follow you? How are you going to reach those 15-25 middle to upper middle class ladies?\\n\\nPresales are the way to go. You need pictures of the products though. So contact the manufacturer in China and have them send you some pictures. All of the social media marketing can be done for free. Once you have grown a following on the social media channels, setup Shopify and use the 14 free days to make enough sales to pay for Shopify and your first order. The other way to go is to sell it here in Reddit. Setup a Google form and ask for paypal email addresses in the form. Actually, do that, do it now. I bet all of the guys here in this Reddit will buy one or two and give them to girlfriends, wives and daughters. But I want to see pictures first!\\n\\nI\\'m cheering you on. I hope you succeed. I\\'m with /u/guydawg I would send you the money just to pay it forward.

I\\'ve been in the identical situation and ended up using HopShopGo to get around it., Ideas aren\\'t unique... and even if it\\'s really new... like Facebook... I am confident that 99% of people cannot execute on it... plus at some point you are going to have tell someone, if you want to get customers. So tell us more, but if you don\\'t want to that\\'s cool as well.\\n\\nMy advice on the tech stuff is to try www.weebly.com to set it up in literally 5 mins with no tech experience.. it won\\'t be perfect, but it will look half decent. If you just want to put up a landing page to see if there is demand, then just use a simple free tool like instapage.com. If it\\'s a subscription box try www.cratejoy.com. Wordpress and Shopify are legit options once you are more sure it will work, then invest in a designer and make it look professional on something like Shopify!\\n\\nI\\'d also recommend thinking about marketing strategy / user acquisition channels, because doing this cost effectively makes or breaks the biz. \\n, I\\'ve got some good news for you, you were not the only one!\\n\\n[Proof I] (http://mtv-tv.mtvnimages.com/images/flipbooks-1/justin-timberlake-best-of/justin-timberlake-may2000.jpg)\\n\\n[Proof II](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uKGOA-tZhHs/T1-eHggLZWI/AAAAAAAAHoo/j_jzC9Fag1Y/s400/Simpson+and+Richie%2527s+past+style+blunders+%25289%2529.jpg)\\n\\n[Proof III] (http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0189/8378/files/04-justin-timberlake_grande.jpg?2153), I\\'m doing something like the model you mentioned at hometownpint.com.

Authorized reseller list on praxis site is helpful.\\n, His shop doesn\\'t seem to offer a Bitcoin payment option even though it uses shopify. Or am I missing something?\\n\\n**Edit**: I asked them and got an answer:\\n&gt; Unfortunately it\\'s more complicated than that.  We have so much custom code in the back end of the store to get API working and whatnot that just toggling something on shopify usually causes a lot of bugs or crashes the store.  There are a fair number of requests for bitcoin though so it might get added at some point.\\n, Agreed. As It stands, it\\'s a nice list and a good resource, but it lacks so much value which is well within its potential. I\\'d say ideally convert it into a table and add a few additional columns of the most pertinent information. What exactly these columns should contain is probably best left up to the community. I could see a post with something like, \"We\\'re updating the platform list and converting it into a table. What information would you like to see on this table?\", doing the trick quite nicely. Then rework it into a table and rely on the commenters to help categorize the entries and populate the additional columns.\\n\\nSome ideas:\\nPlatform Type: SaaS, On-Premises\\nLicensing: Free, Purchased, Rented\\nSource: Open, Closed (Are there any closed source ecommerce platforms? Probably not, though I suppose hosted stuff like Shopify wouldn\\'t really be considered open source)\\nFeatures:  [RB - recurring billing], [CG - configurator] (like built to order PCs), [CZ - customizer] (like t-shirts with custom designs), [C - coupons], [E - email marketing]\\n\\nAll of this is just off the top of my head and is probably far from ideal, but you get the idea. There\\'s an opportunity to put so much information in something like this, and create a resource that someone can use as a great starting point when researching ecommerce platforms. At the moment, we have an excessively long list with no supporting information that basically requires you to click through each item and research them individually., I noticed you haven\\'t mentioned one of the key terms you should probably be looking for: theme. Try googling \"Shopify themes\" or perhaps \"Shopify templates\", and you\\'ll probably have much better luck finding a good selection, and hopefully will be able to find one which fits the bill., [Here](http://i.imgur.com/PAORset.jpg)\\'s how I like my steak. Get a big fat steak (the more marbling the better - the further down [this chart](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0072/5172/files/beef-marbling-standards-chart_large.jpg?101419) your steak looks, the nicer it\\'ll be), grind salt and pepper over both sides and let it sit for 45ish minutes.\\n\\nGet a frying pan on medium-high heat, sear the steaks on both sides for ten seconds. Take them out, melt some butter or margarine in the pan. Steaks go back in 4 minutes the first side, 3 minutes the second.\\n\\nLet them sit for a minute or two before cutting in and they\\'ll be super juicy - cutting them straight away will just let all the juice run away without a chance to be absorbed back into the meat. If they\\'re thick enough they\\'ll keep a fair bit of heat.\\n\\nThere\\'s a bit of an art to getting steak right (you may want to let it go four minutes on side 2 if you\\'re worried about undercooking it, especially if it\\'s like an inch thick), but that\\'s pretty much all there is to it. All you need is good steak (go to a proper butcher if you can), salt, pepper, and a little butter. I never really cooked much, but when I started forcing myself to cook, steak was one of the first things I worked out.\\n\\nYou can deglaze the pan with some red wine and some other things and make a sauce (cheap sherry, worcestershire sauce and a dollop of cream makes Diane sauce which is very tasty), but a good steak will stand on its own.\\n\\nAlso my brilliant new job at Circular Quay has just turned into \"we\\'re moving into an office in St Leonards next week\" and I\\'m not sure I want to stick it out.

I, too, think decaf is gross,  but we brew [Bowtruss Brazil Almedras](http://bowtruss-retail.myshopify.com/collections/coffee/products/decaf-brazil-almendras) and another decaf blend at my shop.

You should also check out Uncommon Coffee Roasters (they\\'re based in Michigan).\\n\\nAnother suggestion (though not exactly foolproof) might be to look for abnormally expensive decaf. The decaffeination process typically removes a lot of flavor from the beans. There are decaffeination methods that preserve these flavors, but (from what I\\'ve heard) they are incredibly expensive. Ergo super pricey decaf. I\\'ve never seen any locally, but I\\'m not a huge coffee connoisseur. It might be something interesting to look into., I went through this analysis myself (I also had Etsy in the mix) - wrote up what I learned were the trade-offs and stuck it on my site. In case this is helpful for anyone else out there: http://bizzy.io/marketing-idea/etsy-vs-shopify-vs-woocommerce/, It is a \\'bombilla\\' used to drink \\'yerba mate\\' (prounounced matay), traditionally from a small dried gourd. Modern mate sets are usually some sort of a wooden cup.\\n\\nhttps://www.google.com.ph/search?q=mate+y+bombilla&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=675&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fH41VbKUPM7n8AXnjoDADw&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ\\n\\nIt\\'s an acquired taste but it\\'s brilliant once you get the hang of it. Argentines drink mate multiple times a day. It is usually shared amongst a small group of people, wherein everyone takes a turn drinking as opposed to everyone having their own mate.\\n\\nEDIT: I love mate so I\\'m going to expand my answer.\\n\\nThere a lots of brands and variations of the \\'yerba\\' itself. Of the big widely distributed brands I prefer La Cruz de Malta.\\n\\nhttp://mpe-s2-p.mlstatic.com/juego-matero-argentino-mate-bombilla-y-yerba-cruz-de-malta-22657-MPE20234353849_012015-O.jpg\\n\\nThe drinking process is pretty ritualistic and quite fun. Normally a small group of friends sit around, fill a gourd with \\'yerba\\' and pour hot water over it. I prefer to drink \\'amargo\\' (bitter, without sugar) although many people drink it with a small spoonful of sugar. One person will usually drink all of the tea out of the gourd, refill it with hot water and then pass it to someone else. Sometimes people drink with hot milk instead of water. It also comes in tea bags and can be prepared like traditional tea, known as \\'mate cocido\\'. In other parts of South America, mate is consumed in similar or somewhat varying ways. Brazilians often drink out of much larger gourds, while Paraguayans drink \\'tereré\\' from hollowed out bull horns using ice cold water or juice instead of hot water.\\n\\nhttp://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0240/9803/files/terere.edit.jpg?317\\n\\nThere are a lot of immigrants in Buenos Aires from Paraguay and I have seen them frequently drinking \\'tereré\\' using cola flavored juice.\\n\\nhttp://i01.i.aliimg.com/photo/v2/117589373/COOL_UP_COLA_FLAVOURED_POWDER_DRINK.jpg\\n\\nMate sets can be purchased on Amazon, but they\\'re unreasonably expensive when you consider that mate is pretty much the cheapest thing in Argentina. Either way, I\\'d recommend it if you haven\\'t tried it before. It\\'s a great habit to form. Just know that if you learn to drink mate anywhere other than in South America, you\\'ll just be a lame hipster.\\n\\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Taragui-Yerba-Mate-Bombilla-Leather/dp/B007V650EM/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1429571960&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=yerba+mate+bombilla\\n\\nEDIT: President Kirchner and Pope Francis sharing mate.\\n\\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Pope_Francis_with_Cristina_Fernandez_de_Kirchner_4.jpg/1024px-Pope_Francis_with_Cristina_Fernandez_de_Kirchner_4.jpg, One of my friends has [this shirt](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0537/4221/products/neverforgettibravery_grande.jpg?v=1410520348), but I don\\'t have any pictures of him wearing it (probably for the best). , [[Hammer Vaporizer 42 dollars off.

Maybe an entirely new template like these; http://goo.gl/ZA6bVD , http://goo.gl/egf1pA , http://goo.gl/O7kIrO , http://goo.gl/o9iiVC (the best ones iv\\'e found on Shopify).\\n\\nAlso, i am in production of a video for the website which will displayed under the three categories.

Is it big commerce, shopify, wordpress with WOO commerce or something else? I\\'ve worked with each of those, and the fixes you seek shouldnt be too complicated (except for perhaps the paypal, but that should only require you to set up a PP account and do a few other easy things). \\n\\nLet me know. , explain [this one](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0224/3435/products/engrish_tshirt_10002_larger_1377938369.png?v=1377938382), A few caveats first. My aim is to constructive and honest. I am not trying to tear down what you are building. I can see it has some promise and you are heading in the right direction but you have a *long* way to go.\\n\\nFirst up the design is terrible. I am assuming you did it yourself and there is obviously a learning curve here so I don\\'t want to discourage you from developing it more but I would suggest either scrapping and starting over or getting someone else on board. \\n\\nThere is a lot that does not work at a very basic aesthetic level (gradients/rounded corners/the word-art style logo - all very *1997*).\\n\\nThe bigger problem is there is a lot that doesn\\'t work on a structural level (my path through the site should be: this is what we do &gt; this is why you need it &gt; this is how you buy it - instead you are throwing your users in at the deep end and assuming they know what they are looking for).\\n\\nThis problem extends to how you are pitching the product. I would assume if you know the terminology you are using (distro/linux/names of distros etc) then you can mount a drive yourself. \\nYour target audience are newbies (right?). You need to explain what each version offers in simple terms (give them a way to search? You want a distro to do X/Y/Z - why not try CentOS). Explain what you are selling (why do they need a USB? Why can\\'t they have a CD? These are questions you clients will ask. It doesn\\'t matter if they have not spotted there netbook doesn\\'t have a CD drive. Some will ask).\\n\\nSo what do you do? My two cents would be\\n\\n- Look into a WP template or Shopify if you have zero funds\\n- If you can invest in the business (you need to invest to grow) then get someone onboard who can deal with the web-side of things\\n- Look into rewriting/developing on the site. Any you write *anything* on the site ask yourself - will my client understand this, will my client know what X terms are\\n\\nOne problem I have not touch on is building up a relationship with clients (once you have some). What would be a big disadvantage with any other product (Linux is complicated!) is a big advantage for you to draw clients back. I would look at creating low-mid level tutorials for Linux basics (how to install an external HD, how to add a printer etc). This would allow you to build up a blog and drive traffic to the site as well as helping your existing clients get started., I like the layout, the graphics, BUT for me, it\\'s all a bit much with the ENDLESS too cute to be true descriptions, blog posts, etc.  \\n\\nA bit overboard for me. A little is nice; a lot is DEATHLY., Here is a link to the first issue of CBLDF DEFENDER, *\"a new free quarterly news magazine coming to you from the front lines of the fight for free speech.\"*\\n\\nhttps://archive.today/kf4iL#selection-609.2-609.100\\n\\nhttps://archive.today/o/kf4iL/http://cbldf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CBLDFDefender_Issue01_sm.pdf\\n\\nAnd if you really want to strike a blow against pro-censorship people like Mark Waid, you can buy [THIS](http://cbldf.myshopify.com/collections/books/products/daredevil-by-mark-waid-vol-1-hardcover-signed-by-mark-waid) signed copy of Daredevil, written by Mark Waid!  All monies go to the CBLDF to help them protect comic books from those ~~SJW\\'s~~ moral crusaders who judge them *offensive*, and demand they be withdrawn from sale., I\\'m guessing the number of sales is pretty low, so maybe the no-frills solution is best: just to list the items on a webpage, along with the price in your local currency, and a \"we take bitcoin - email us\" message. When they email you, you generate a new address and email it back, along with the price in bitcoins.\\n\\nThe slightly more up-market version is to create a shop. Either use a hosted solution etsy or shopify, or host your own, and use something which supports one of [Bitpay\\'s plugins](https://bitpay.com/bitcoin-for-ecommerce).\\n\\n, Found this imagine in my search for WW1 Propaganda, and this is a \"remade\" piece of American propaganda during WW1, Titled [Destroy This Mad Brute - Enlist](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0117/3662/products/destroy-this-mad-brute.jpeg?v=1403238841) which is supposed to symbolize German aggression and activities during the war. The fact that the creator has so obviously altered it with no real meaning is what gets me, and the image itself is quite terrible\\n\\nI think the creator wanted to show that the targeted perpetrator uses \"Family Values\" to rob people of their personal freedom, wielding false \"religion\" as another weapon. All in all, it\\'s pretty nonsensical, Credit/Debit payments or e-commerce sites experience similar issues. For example, try using Shopify and credit/debit payment systems even if you\\'re just selling e-liquid. They\\'ll tell you that you\\'re not allowed to. It\\'s becoming ridiculous. \\n\\nThis is not even remotely a Paypal only issue., [pied piper](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0262/2091/products/piedpipertshirt_thumb_large.jpg?v=1398361155)\\n\\n[game of thrones](https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/game-of-thrones-logo.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=750&amp;crop=1), [Vengeance RDA](http://advanced-vapors.myshopify.com/products/authentic-vengeance-rda-by-paradigm-modz), Hey I am one of the founders of ReCharge for Shopify great to hear your feedback!

How about the CEO of OMERS, one of the largest pension plans in the country, or of Shopify, a posterchild of Canada\\'s new knowledge economy? , Yes, definitely! \\n\\nThe only annoying part is getting the original (non-NATO) strap off. For that, it helps to have a [spring bar tool](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0175/4286/products/WW_STRAP-TOOL_5.jpg?v=1349027145) but you can probably do it with a little screwdriver.

I have an account set up to run on my shopify store but haven\\'t gotten anyone to join just yet, not the biggest of priorities on my list but still could be useful in the future. Have any suggestions. i know you say call up an affilate network. care to elaborate?, by maybe an inch or two? and the concave is a bit deeper plus wheelbases 23-25 which sounds about perfect for me.\\n\\n[More Info](http://pantheonlongboards.myshopify.com/products/2015-pantheon-logos), [Here yea go!](https://rideit.myshopify.com), I have read of it, of course, and even considered buying a [rubber ducky|(http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe?variant=353378649) for fooling around (I know there\\'s a difference, but the attack patterns would be similar). \\nBut for once, I have to date not heard of any actual incident with this (it\\'s only a matter of time, but still a good sign) and I would imagine that the limits of the hardware (usb-drives don\\'t really have a lot of processing power) will work as a deterrent to use this security gap. \\n\\nSo in the end, yes you\\'re right, this will be used to penetrate systems and if I was responsible for IT security in a critical environment I\\'d have yet another reason to punch people for using usb drives, but that doesn\\'t mean there\\'s a reason to panic. There\\'s an infinite reservoir of bugs and possible exploits, many of which are more convenient to use. And you don\\'t need to run faster than the grizzly chasing you, only faster than the slowest member of your group., Go with Shopify if you want simplicity. For $30 a month you\\'ll get stripe built in to the platform with no configuration necessary. With Woocommerce you\\'ll need to setup a payment processor like one of the ones you mentioned. Right now Braintree is waving all fees on your first $50,000 in revenue. , So, I would have to be selling so much that the Woocommerce fees are less than the $30 per month and the difference in fees? Thirty bucks seems cheap to stop worrying about this. \\n\\nSo, Shopify makes Woocommerce unnecessary, that\\'s what you are saying?, As the apparent decider of who\\'s reputable or not, who do you consider a business leader if not the founder/CEO of Hootsuite, Slack/Flickr, Shopify, OpenText, and OMERS ventures?, What browser are you viewing it on? I\\'ll connect with Shopify support., If you haven\\'t decided on a platform for your site yet, then I\\'d recommend Shopify. Really simple and they have some slick single product templates. , Here is my confusion though - I\\'ve been buying things with a PayPal button for like 15 years. If it\\'s really better, why does Shopify even exist? Obviously Shopify is selling something compelling, but I can\\'t figure out what it is.\\n\\nAlso, there are a huge number of serious complaints about PayPal, which I\\'m concerned about.\\n, &gt; Why is it not ethical?\\n\\nIt isn\\'t exactly \\'ethical\\' email marketing if those email addresses didn\\'t expressly consent to being on a mailing list. Because they are previous customers this falls into a sort of \\'grey area\\' where you can email them, but should attempt to get them to consent to being on a mailing list right away before messaging them again. ie: Email blast that asks them if they want to subscribe to a newsletter, while giving the rundown of the new Shopify shop.\\n\\nIn Canada there are fairly strict anti-spam laws, dunno how things are in the US. Mailchimp is also very strict about spam rules too. Last thing you want to do is trigger a spam filter that gets you blacklisted as its a pain in the ass to get unblacklisted., They are two entirely different ecommerce platforms. Shopify is great because it has everything built in and ready to go without needing much configuration or expertise. Hosting, follow up emails, blog posts etc. it\\'s all ready to go. Woocommerce can do everything shopify can do or more, but will require a lot more effort on your part., Honestly, there is nothing wrong with PP or Shopify, which uses Stripe as a payment processor. Paypal is fine aslong as you are doing everything above board, have good record keeping etc. Any problems I have had, a quick call to my account manager and I\\'m sorted. Sometimes have to verify information etc.\\n\\nI just made a long ass video about which CMS to use, seems it might be helpful to you. I talk in the first few minutes about Shopify and Squarespace, who should use them.\\n\\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/33eoj3/after_many_discussion_with_clients_and_endless/, First off, thank you so much for your input. This kind of free advice is what makes this subreddit awesome.\\n\\nI\\'m just going to write a statement, and I was hoping you could correct if for me if anything is incorrect.\\n\\n\"I am going to choose Shopify on my Wordpress site, because Shopify will make Braintree, Blue Pay, Base Rate, and other processors unnecessary. I won\\'t need to use Woocommerce, or Authorize.net, I\\'ll just be able make a button that says \"buy now\", and then insert Shopify. I won\\'t need a merchant bank, a processor, a gateway, or anyone else, just Shopify. Money goes from Shopify to my bank account. I will pay for this convenience through higher fees.\", Shopify and wordpress are 100% separate. There is some shopify plugin for wordpress but I don\\'t believe that is applicable here. Each is a completely distinct platform. Woocommerce is essentially a plugin that gives wordpress ecommerce functionality. Whatever you have created on wordpress would need to be rebuilt on shopify. On either shopify or wordpress (via woocommerce) you will need a payment processor. Shopify has this built in via stripe. On wordpress (woocommerce) you will need to add processing. This could be as simple as a Paypal button or a more elegant solution. Either platform will require you to pay a processing fee of approximately 2.9%. On wordpress you pay that to whatever processor you select and on shopify that goes to stripe. In addition to that 2.9% fee, shopify also has a $30 a month fee, but that includes hosting.  , Ahh, so I would have to completely eliminate my Wordpress website then if I went with Shopify. That changes things, and makes it Shopify vs Wordpress, not Shopify vs. Woocommerce. That is part of what I was confused about.\\n\\nIf I wanted to keep my existing site, I would need Woocommerce, and then something like Braintree? Could I still use Stripe in that context in place of Braintree?, &gt; If I wanted to keep my existing site, I would need Woocommerce, and then something like Braintree? Could I still use Stripe in that context in place of Braintree?\\n\\nYes, and yes. \\n\\nThink of it more as Shopify vs. WordPress + WooCommerce + payment processor of your choice.\\n\\nAs mentioned before, Shopify is a really good option for $30/month, Reviews, website, brochure (pictures of food and mention easy/little/no cleaning). \\n\\n1. Reviews- perform a google search for personal chefs in your area. Make note of the types of sites that come up. If they are listing websites (like Yelp) find out how to be on those sites. Then generate reviews from friends and/or previous customers. Do this by sending out emails with clear instructions and a link.\\n\\n2. Website- do this soon, it should be on the sites that post your reviews. You can easily create a website through many sites- I recommend Squarespace, Shopify. Stay away from sites that want you to put their domain in yours (example: theirname.yourdomain.com). Create a simple MOBILE friendly (find \"responsive\" designs if you can pick out a design) website with at least a main, about, pricing, contact, and menu page. Those pages should have a couple paragraphs worth of text, a pictures with a caption if possible, and a good title with the keywords you\\'d want someone to find if they did a google search. And finally- a happy, nice looking photo of yourself will put potential customers at ease.\\n3. Brochure- Microsoft Publisher should have some templates. I\\'d use that same photo on the website in your brochure. Talk about your features (look up \"benefits vs. features\" to explain this) and include photos of meals prepared, a clean kitchen, happy customers (you get the idea) to complement these features. Always include a Call To Action and your contact info and website. \\n\\nHope this helps- good luck!, So the choice is between Shopify (all-inclusive resort), and Wordpress + manual plug ins and additions (nice cabin close to the beach, with best food in town 250m away).\\n\\nThe former is much more my style, but the latter is very compelling from a time management perspective.\\n, I\\'ve been in web dev for about four years.

They just redesigned some of their dashboard functions which improved our experience even more. They offer templates that you can use to get started or modify as needed. Blog posting is integrated as part of the software. They offer several different levels of service so you can start small and then pay more and integrate more features as your business grows and you become more savvy as an ecommerce business. There are also specific apps that you can purchase independently to connect Shopify with other selling platforms or to enhance the buyer experience (upsell, conversions, etc.). Taxing is integrated into the software and you can modify to a certain extent as needed., Thanks!

And if you\\'re just starting out with html, creating a good and secure webshop is going to take a while..., Like with a WiFi Pineapple? http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple?variant=81044992, [Fred Perry canvas sneakers.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0236/8435/products/IMG_8824_grande.JPG?v=1426264077), I fundamentally disagree with many of the premises and arguments in this article.\\n\\n&gt; 1. Ruby on Rails is a web application framework.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; It is NOT the same thing as Ruby. Ruby on Rails is basically a collection of shortcuts written in Ruby that lets you build web applications – basically websites – really quickly. The benefit to learning a web application framework (like Ruby on Rails) before learning a programming language itself (like Ruby) is that you’ll make quicker progress in the beginning, you’ll have a real site that you can share with friends, and you’ll see how the things you’re learning actually apply to the things you want to be able to do.\\n\\nThis assumes that all beginners should be web developers, and should want to be web developers. It also assumes that the best way to learn programming is to learn rapidly + build apps quickly. I think instead, it\\'s more important to slow down and start with the fundamentals + acquire a solid base to help prepare for future growth.\\n\\nIf the beginner is somebody who is not intrinsically interested in programming and computer science, and just wants to get a website up-and-running quickly, then sure, RoR is a good choice. I see a lot of entrepreneurial-type and business-type people with this mindset.\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s important to note that startups and entrepreneurship is only a small, small aspect of computer science and programming, and that you\\'re doing an incredible disservice to beginners to imply otherwise.\\n\\n&gt; 2 Some of the biggest websites in the world are built with Ruby on Rails.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Basecamp, Airbnb, Bleacher Report, Fab.com, Scribd, Groupon, Gumroad, Hulu, Kickstarter, Pitchfork, Sendgrid, Soundcloud, Square, Yammer, Crunchbase, Slideshare, Funny or Die, Zendesk, Github, Shopify.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Enough said.\\n\\nThere are many other websites that are build in other languages. \\n\\nThat said, I think this bullet point is a good argument as to why RoR might be a viable candidate, but is not strong enough to demonstrate that RoR is _the_ language to teach.\\n\\nAlso, nitpick: Groupon at least is [migrating away from Ruby](https://engineering.groupon.com/2013/node-js/geekon-i-tier/).\\n\\n&gt; 3 Lots of startups are hiring for Ruby on Rails.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; It’s not the most in-demand thing to learn for jobs in general – there are way more job openings out there for things like Java, PHP, even Python – but in terms of working at a startup, great Ruby on Rails developers are some of hardest people to find. This is mostly because…\\n\\nValid point.\\n\\n&gt; 4 Ruby on Rails is full-stack.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Unlike most languages – like (HTML/CSS, Javascript, Python, and SQL) – Ruby on Rails covers both the front-end and the back-end. That means one Ruby on Rails developer can build an entire web application, without having to rely on someone else to build the back-end or front-end for them. A nice side-effect of this is that if you learn Ruby on Rails, you’ll end up learning a bit of HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Ruby along the way. That’s not the case at all if you just start with any of those languages.\\n\\nNot necessarily -- the same can be said for other languages like Python if you use the right framework. Another counter-example would be PHP. With JavaScript, you also have Node.js, which can be used for the backend.\\n\\n&gt; 5 Ruby on Rails has a thriving community.  \\n&gt; 6 The Ruby on Rails community is very beginner-friendly.  \\n&gt; 7 There are a lot of great online resources for learning Ruby on Rails and Ruby.\\n\\nFair.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard some rumors otherwise regarding point 5, but I don\\'t know enough about the Rails community to contest that, so I\\'ll concede that point. \\n\\nPoint 6 and 7 in particular are probably the strongest arguments in this article.\\n\\n&gt; 8 Ruby itself is a forgiving language for beginners.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; At the end of the day Ruby on Rails applications are mostly written in Ruby, so it helps that it has a few features that make it especially good for beginners to learn. Unlike Javascript and many other languages, you don’t need to remember to end your lines with a semicolon (;). Unlike Python and some other languages, whitespaces and tabbing doesn’t matter. A lot of the times, you can leave out things like parenthesis () and curly brackets {} and it doesn’t even matter! Ruby knows what you meant. On top of that, Ruby is very readable. Check this out:\\n&gt;\\n&gt;     5.times { print \"Odelay!\" }\\n&gt;\\n&gt; This little example (courtesy of Why) does exactly what it says. Try reading it out loud. Five times print “Odelay!” Compare that to the same thing in Java:\\n&gt;\\n&gt;     for(int a = 1; a &lt; 6; a++){\\n&gt;         System.out.print(\"Odelay!\");\\n&gt;     }\\n&gt;\\n&gt; The second is much harder to read and understand as a beginner.\\n\\nI think the syntax thing here is a bit subjective. The problem with the ruby example is that you end up having to teach many more concepts in order to fully explain what\\'s going on (blocks, procs, and lambdas) and end up having to segue into talking about functional programming, which I think is a bit excessive.\\n\\nIn contrast, in the second example, the syntax might be a bit clunkier, but the overall cognitive load is lesser.\\n\\nThis applies to other things as well -- for example, many Ruby frameworks and libraries (including Rails) makes fairly frequent use of metaprogramming which is definitely not something a beginner should need to know.\\n\\nIf your goal is to get something up and running, fine, those features are handy and convenient, but if your goal is to learn programming, then having to deal with those advanced features from almost day one makes it that much harder to learn and acquire a good grasp of the fundamentals.\\n\\n&gt; 9 Ruby on Rails hides a lot of the stuff you don’t need to know.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; You won’t need to know any SQL to use a database in your Ruby on Rails application. That is awesome. In most cases, Ruby on Rails will just make an assumption about how you want to do something unless you tell it otherwise. That makes it particularly easy for beginners who aren’t going to know or care about customizing every little thing about their application when they start.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Another example is the beautiful way that Ruby on Rails treats pulling in third-party code and keeping it up to date for you. Also it does a bunch of security stuff for you for free, like preventing SQL-injection in most cases, cross-site scripting, session hijacking, and much more. Other languages assume you know how to do that stuff on your own. It also comes with it’s own server for running locally.\\n\\nI disagree that we should be hiding things from beginners -- it obscures what\\'s on and prevents them from grasping the essentials. \\n\\nBut again, this comes down to the \"learn quickly\" vs \"actually learn\" difference in mindset.\\n\\n&gt; 10 Ruby on Rails teaches you development best practices.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Because Ruby on Rails makes a lot of assumptions about how you should do stuff, it forces you to do stuff the commonly accepted way, at least at first. This includes RESTful resources, MVC framework, testing (it includes a testing framework by default), and much more.\\n\\nOther languages and frameworks also do this as well. Rails doesn\\'t hold a monopoly here.\\n\\n&gt; These are only a few of the reasons I could think of for why a beginner should learn Ruby on Rails. Honestly, if you don’t already know about programming, most of this stuff will go over your head. But the point of this article is to convince more experienced developers to stop telling beginners to start with stupid languages like PHP, and also to show beginners that there are significant, and well though-out reasons for a beginner to start with Ruby on Rails, even if you don’t understand what they are.\\n\\nAssuming that our goal is to teach a beginner web programming (which again, I don\\'t think should be the default choice), see http://pgbovine.net/teaching-web-programming.htm for an alternate viewpoint and approach., In probably 99% of ecommerce cases, you don\\'t actually need anything like Magento. A hosted solution like Shopify where someone *else* worries about database queries, performance, maintenance, support etc. is pretty handy and the trade-offs are minimal for *most* small businesses., Similar to [Stelton Pure Black](http://media.madeindesign.com/nuxeo/divers/9/7/972cf21b-343b-4125-a306-b5f0a8370fd2.jpg)\\n\\n[The set](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/6702/products/opt-Pure-black-set_6_grande.jpg?v=1339696132), What I have learned in the last few years of trying different avenues of ecommerce, it\\'s possible to test a market segment for quite cheap. In terms of clothing what I would do is look at trends selling on top ebay or Amazon stores (not mainstream brands ofcourse ie gap or American eagle). Study the material combinations and then try finding a supplier from alibaba or aliexpress. Setting up the store front can be relatively easy thru shopify or woocommerce. If you are trying to do something customized in terms of clothing design, try implanting your designs thru photoshop. You can get an idea of your responses by studying your analytics.

If you want to get started in this then start with aliexpress/alibaba and look for \\'supplement manufacturers\\' that can package/bottle your products. If you want to try it out, start with some of the more popular supplements that kind of fall under the nootropic category like l-theanine, caffeine, choline, uridine, fish oil, etc. These are common enough that just about any supplement manufacturer has them in house and ready to slap your label on it. Shop around for product quality and see who can give you the lowest minimum order requirement, some go as low as 50-100 bottle minimums. \\n\\nIt sounds easy, but trust me it\\'s work ;) , Not me [my shoes are very important in my design](http://www.furaffinity.net/view/15815550/)\\n\\n[They\\'re actually real too](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0219/2704/products/gen2wfpf2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1368483338), Don\\'t have pictures but here are some that I saw:\\n\\n[This](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0706/6455/products/silvergramophone.jpg?v=1425521518)\\n\\n[Dark red shirt with this woman on it](http://kellianderson.com/projects/assets/images/project_images/nmh5.jpg)\\n\\nTan and olive green colored shirts with [this on them](https://noahliebermanmusic.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/neutral-milk-hotel.jpg)\\n\\nI also saw a shirt with [this](http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/news/57791/3be1f064.jpeg) on it after the show but I didn\\'t see those at the booth when I was there before the concert.

This is the one thing keeping me from selling on Amazon. Currently I have a product I sell from a shopify store and don\\'t need a UPC for every product. Thoughts?, I was confused about this.\\n\\nYou buy one UPC (barcode/number) per product, that one product say you have 1000 of  model 001 wood sunglasses, they all use the same barcode the same UPC you bought for 1.99. \\n\\nIs the product you sell on the Shopify store your private label product?  If so just buy a UPC, you input it once into the Amazon listing page and its over and done with.  The next step is getting the barcode stickers on your product packaging and shipping them to an Amazon FBA warehouse, Great job!\\n\\nI am starting to sell beef jerky in a restricted geographical area (Eastern Europe).\\n\\nCan you tell me what is the Shopify theme you are using?

The problem you have is that no traffic is coming to your site to begin with - you need arborists coming to the website before you can even begin to assess what parts of the site are working and which are not. 100 visitors a week can basically be rounded down to 0 for a number of good reasons.\\n\\nSo even though I can think of a dozen site improvements just off the top of my head, I will suggest you leave the site alone and work on getting qualified traffic (aka people who actually want to buy this equipment). You\\'re either going to have to put in serious time and effort to learn how to do this yourself, or hire a company that specializes in online marketing and you feel is capable of getting you results.\\n\\nGoogle Adwords is a complex system, but if you put some time into learning it (everything will take time), it IS very low hanging fruit. If you are promoting to people that are looking for \"tree climbing harness\" (no idea if that\\'s a real keyword), they are coming to your harnesses section, and consistently not buying over hundreds of visits, then you know there\\'s something wrong (price? website?). You should at least be able to get buyers this way, even if it\\'s at breakeven (it\\'s a lot easier to worry about figuring out profitability once you get over the hurdle of finding customers in the first place).\\n\\nThat said Adwords is one source of traffic. There are many others, and many good resources on learning traffic generation. It\\'s not something I can just write up in a Reddit comment. However Shopify has done a tremendous job of providing great beginner guides here:\\n\\nhttps://ecommerce.shopify.com/guides in particular https://ecommerce.shopify.com/guides/make-your-first-ecommerce-sale is a great starting point since you are in the position of needing your first sales.\\n\\nI also always recommend: http://www.quicksprout.com/the-definitive-guide-to-growth-hacking/\\n\\nA few tips:\\n\\nIf this is going to be your full-time business, seriously consider hiring a consultant/marketing agency because it is a LOT to learn and implement. Yes it\\'s also hard to hire a good consultant.\\n\\nGo to where the customers are. Not every strategy makes sense for every market. I don\\'t know anything about arborists, but my first thought would be \"how do I reach them?\". I would pickup the phone and dial 100 tree care companies and ask them about how they buy (people are surprisingly willing to talk to you for research) and I\\'d try a soft sell at the end to see if they are interested in my site and actually buy (people pulling out wallet is the best test for whether they want what you are selling). That would give me tonnes of good information to start formulating what traffic generation strategies might work. \\n\\nSome traffic strategies take far longer than others. Figuring out adwords for the first time might be a month long project, whereas achieving consistent SEO rankings might mean 6 months to a year to get results. Calling up companies can be done in weeks, a content marketing strategy may take months.\\n\\ntl;dr: no amount of website changes will get you the sale, you need to focus on traffic because unlike a marketplace like eBay, having your own store doesn\\'t provide this to you, and you either need to be willing to invest significant time to figure this out, or invest in an expert to help you., Squarespace! 4square is the check-in app! It looks like she didn\\'t use it, because her site is made by Calpernia and the shop is made with shopify, Hi well done.

You have to build an audience and create your sales channels. There is an article in the shopify blog that says the best performing companies build their audience BEFORE they launch. All of the people you sold to know ebay would be good audience. I dont know if ebay allows you to email people you have sold to, but I would get all of those email addresses and send them a \"hey we just opened!\" I have a feeling that violates eBay\\'s TOS. But that is essentially what you need to do. Find qualified buyers and direct them to your store. \\n\\nThere are many ways to do that. Facebook and Google Plus are good starts. So are Twitter and Instagram. \\n\\nYou should also try to connect with arborist bloggers and have them write articles about your store. Find tangential bloggers and have them write about your store. Do a google search for \"how do I get bloggers to write about my site\" and check out the moz article. It is a gold mine. \\n\\nKeep plugging away. I am about three months ahead of you. The sales will come, but you need way more traffic to get those sales. , Or any other platform. Sick of Magento and want to move to Shopify? Your front end doesn\\'t care.

It must be pretty easy to migrate the SPA to Magento2.\\n\\nI also wouldn\\'t chose Shopify or any other cloud provider: Your data does not belong to you anymore. What if ... you\\'re dependent on a 3rd party ..., Ooookay... Ill shut my eyes and try and squeeze some sleep back in. Ive tried in different browsers, with different payment methods.. And it seems to be the Shopify page where I get stuck. Thank you, please know, I wanted to be one of your first buyers for this. *SadFace*, That\\'s really weird! :( I keep getting orders in so it\\'s either an isolated thing or a problem with mobile. I think there\\'s a way for me to test the checkout option using Shopify, so I can probably try to recreate the incident when I\\'m not past my bedtime lol.

If you tuck your pants into them and wear skin tight jeans, then yes it will probably be considered feminine. However, the boots were created for locomotive engineers, they are about as masculine as it comes. They have also been the go to boot for motorcycle culture for years, even before Marlon Brando made them famous in *The Wild One*. They are a staple, a classic. No one can \"claim\" them. It\\'s like saying that because girls wear jeans, men can\\'t wear jeans because they\\'re now feminine. \\n\\nHas there been a large influx of girls wearing engineering boots? Yes. My girlfriend has two pairs in fact, but I still wouldn\\'t call them feminine. In fact, I don\\'t think she would either.\\n\\nDo I have a pair myself? No, not yet. I\\'m saving up for a nice pair of Nick\\'s or WESCO\\'s in a brown roughout, reminiscent of [Ace Wilson\\'s](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0258/1087/products/IMG_8548_large.jpg?v=1387243088).\\n\\nAlso, because I\\'m a pedant, technically the boots you\\'re looking at are harness boots. Everything above still applies to harness boots as it does to engineering boots. Hell, you could make the same correlation with cowboy boots, riding boots for women with jodhpur boots for men (albeit this is a bit of a stretch), boat shoes, Converses, Vans, Doc Martin\\'s, flip flops, running shoes, the list goes on and on., https://skp-ts.myshopify.com/products/the-super-solo-cup-full-print-shirt\\nCheaper and cooler in my opinion. , Netto havde [lakridschips](https://osuma.dk/custgfx/5709497002645.jpg) på tilbud for et par uger siden.\\n\\nOg Selleberg (som laver helt fantastiske produkter i øvrigt) sælger [disse](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0665/1183/products/KirsebaerLakridsWeb_1024x1024.jpg?v=1414144204)., I have a logo, I just haven\\'t figured out how to make shopify display it. I have read that LLC must be displayed since that is my official business name. \\n\\nThe \"sheets\" are canvas and the wrinkles aren\\'t a huge concern, it gives it a rustic look. The products are to be used in a barn. Even if the sheets were of a concern to a customer, I highly doubt that would be a dealbreaker for them. I have the most detailed pictures of any of my competitors. I researched that ahead of time. Most of the way my site is presented, comes from how I have seen my competition present things. I\\'m not competing with Banana Republic here and I\\'m not trying to create a \"high-end\" niche for homesteaders. \\n\\nI know ads on the site where you are selling something is usually a no-no but I do have competitors prices on my site and people searching for milking machines will get other competitors ads and click on them to check them out and I do get money from those clicks. One of the selling points of my product is the prices are far lower than my competitors so I want them to check out other sites. \\n\\nThe Welcome paragraph does need to be reworked, I agree with that. \\n\\nNow after that critique, is any of that making me not look like a legitimate business? , If it helps, I tried on iphone 6 and the newest ipad, I tried with google and safari, paypal and card. It wasnt until I hit Shopify that I encountered \"The total of your order has changed, please be aware of changes before completing your order\" and that was on both devices. It worked with no problems on laptop. I hope its just isolated to me, and the orders are flooding in. You is shamaze 👍 , Thank you, that does help!! I\\'ll try calling Shopify as well and seeing what\\'s up if I can\\'t replicate it :), we\\'re actually looking at Shopify since hubby is a software/web guy and it has apps to let us sell in person through the online inventory and payment system, [Link](http://phantom-glass.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/pg-for-nexus-6)\\n\\nAlso **PGNEXUS6** for 15% off., is it the bags? are you being a reseller for them?\\n\\nIf they are hand made, even if you didnt hand make them, I think you can sell them on etsy... \\n\\nBut shopify sounds like a great avenue to go towrd.\\n\\nI keep meaning to look into it, but i get over whelmed by it all, I just released a podcast episode this week with an entrepreneur that went on Shark Tank, got a deal with Daymond John, but then afterwards they both decided that the deal wasn\\'t great for both parties and didn\\'t go through with it.  \\n\\nThe good outcome though was that she still regularly talks to Daymond John and Mark Cuban.\\n\\nLink to the episode: http://shopifymasters.org/freshlypicked/, I\\'d much rather own his [father\\'s shades](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0108/4672/t/5/assets/blog_Kim-Jon-Ill-happy-stunner.jpg?594) than Un\\'s ball.  His dad was a much better dictator and dresser...  Long live Ill, son of the Great Leader!, Well we already sort of knew each other, but we hadn\\'t really gone out yet, but one Valentine\\'s day we were chatting over office IM and I told her, \"Hang on, I\\'ve got a Love Letter for you.\"\\n\\nSo I proceed to walk up to her station and hand her a copy of [this!](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0567/8889/files/LoveLetter-components.jpg?520678849731)\\n\\nMy unreliable narrator-ness remembers her as being visibly flustered as she thanks me, and I get back to an IM message that essentially says, \"You dick!\"\\n\\nIt really helps when you\\'re both into gaming. :D, Oh, same here.

I\\'d prefer an official one from Charlie Wagers, though. For now, I\\'m using it as my [iPhone background](http://i.imgur.com/IQLwAru.jpg). , Java, in college, left after I got my associates because I found it too costly and slow. Learned so much more on my own. So I chose to go the PHP route. I wanted to build web applications really bad. Spent WAY too much time researching languages and frameworks. Finally just chose PHP and went at it. I started with codeigniter, then jumped ship to laravel 3. Still use laravel today, its fantastic. Then I naturally progressed to javascript (jquery). I still explore new technologies all the time. But, 90% of the time PHP, javascript, mysql gets the job done. I am now into learning node and angular (MEAN) stack. Although I read a lot of bad things about mongo. BUT same goes for PHP and PHP is a great web language. Where all this got me? I have fairly new shopify app that generates some cash flow and I work for an agency that pays pretty well. No regrets.  , Get best hosted solution to setup your website on Shopify’s servers at Interloper Inc, that takes the hassles of server management out of the picture. So get ready to contact Shopify Ecommerce Developers now. \\n, I have attempted to block all shopping related sites, including Shopify and Paypal checkout, but these options aren\\'t readily available on the phone, which I have recently abused in the past two months as a shopping outlet. I\\'m still trying to figure out better ways to limit my impulse purchases so these tips really help! , i started with squarespace, that was pretty easy to do with zero html skills, but it was a bit restrictive as to what i could do with it.\\n\\nthen i used shopify, learned a lot about html/css while messing with a theme, but the system is a bit clunky and both front/back end doesn\\'t look or work as well as squarespace.  but superior for ecommerce.\\n\\nnow i\\'m on wordpress (namecheap domain + hosting) and i\\'m not sure if i\\'ll ever go back to the rest, the amount of themes / plugins / control / support available is just insane compared to everything else.  \\n\\nas with most recommendations in this sub, just pick one and run with it, your business isn\\'t dependent on which platform you choose to run your website.  launch your shit, get your users, be more familiar with what features you need, then switch platforms if necessary (or hire somebody to do it for you better than you could yourself)., Check out Shopify.\\n\\nIt is (in my opinion) the easiest, \"all in one\" provider.  Domain registration, hosting, domain emails, shopping cart, website themes, etc.  There are also a lot of apps available that plug right into their platform (customer reviews, cart abandonment, etc.)\\n\\nThe only drawback I\\'ve experienced with them was the email.  You are able to register as many \"xxxx@yourdomain.com\" emails as you want, and have them forwarded to any email that you currently own.  This is great, but the problem comes when you want to SEND email out.  It isn\\'t from the \"xxxx@yourdomain.com\" address.  I had to get Google For Business to be able to do this., Shopify is your best option. It\\'s like the wordpress of ecommerce platforms, they do everything very well. Check them out!, Thanks, I had not heard of Shopify, this is mainly for a blog-type site but I do hope to maybe host ads to possibly make a revenue, will look into it for sure., I just opened my shop. \\n[http://l-dopa-shop.myshopify.com/](http://l-dopa-shop.myshopify.com/)\\n\\nHere\\'s a 25% off coupon code if you see anything you like: SHOPSTARTER, The shop is open!\\n[http://l-dopa-shop.myshopify.com/](http://l-dopa-shop.myshopify.com/)\\n\\nHere\\'s a 25%-off coupon if you see anything you like.

I believe you can submit DMCA takedown requests to redbubble as well and they should take down any infringing stores.\\n\\nHow import is the marketplace size to you? As it stands, my service is *not a marketplace*, and it does not send any traffic to you, in exchange for costs over 50% lower than S6. It\\'s more like a free Shopify that prints on demand, as it just sets up your own store for you.\\n\\nDo you think the reason people don\\'t care is because it doesn\\'t seem like you would get any sales without a marketplace? Is the primary motivator of setting up a Society6 is that people browsing on Society6 will buy your stuff?, Thank you so much. I have a Society 6 store but decided to build a new store recently, I have these prints and one other available, still working on adding a backlog of other designs :)\\n\\nmax-morin.myshopify.com, &gt; Do you think the reason people don\\'t care is because it doesn\\'t seem like you would get any sales without a marketplace? Is the primary motivator of setting up a Society6 is that people browsing on Society6 will buy your stuff?\\n\\nI do, yes. The reason S6 and RB can get away with crappy royalties is that they make up for it in bulk sales. The artist ultimately sees more money from lots of small sales than they would from dramatically fewer large sales. That\\'s why it\\'s so hard to topple those websites even when they give artists such terrible rates. \\n\\nI\\'m not really a potential client, I just have prior perspective on this stuff from having run an Etsy store for a while and now running my own independent store on Shopify. I totally understand the need for good print-on-demand services, but you do have to stand out for some reason. I don\\'t think solid royalties is really going to be enough for you., Thanks, that\\'s very elucidating. I figured that somewhat, which is why I go after the top sellers on S6 who have their own marketing power, and people who run their own shops. However many artists have told me that Society6 generally does not send very many sales (1-2 per month)...\\n\\nDoes your independent store sell prints? My service is actually closer to Shopify than it is to S6, in that it lets you list your own products along with print-on-demand., Thanks for the replies guys!\\n\\nCan Shopify be self-hosted? The address to any of the sub-domains should preferably be sub-domain.mainplatform.com, not sub-domain.shopify.com. Can it do that?\\n, Oh wow... this looks really good!

We\\'ve moved many a client off magento ( and many other platforms ) onto Shopify. A 1:1 perfect migration is very expensive in terms of resources. The data never lines up and there\\'s always a ton of crap you need to weed out. It always sucks. Always. Cart2cart is a workhorse but don\\'t rely on it 100%, you\\'ll have lots of manual work to do.\\n\\nFound its usually best to try and motivate the client they are starting fresh with a new site and to start fresh with data and reporting. Shopify\\'s interface helps to sell this mindset. Have them archive all their data to retain history and keep an instance of the old site running for a few months just in case it needs to be referenced. It\\'s shocking how unimportant a lot of that data is. After 30days ( or your companies return policy ) it\\'s amazing how fast that old data gets forgotten if it\\'s not actively business critical.\\n\\nEdit: typo, I think scarves made out of it turn out absolutely stunning!

It\\'s like the wordpress of ecommerce platforms, they do everything very well. Check them out!\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the extent of \"quite a complex...\" means in OP\\'s post, but because Shopify *is* the Wordpress of ecommerce, it doesn\\'t handle complex very well. I\\'ve had clients that have asked us to move them to a Magento instance because Shopify couldn\\'t satisfy their business rules.\\n\\nIf you have a simple ecommerce site and are willing to live with limitations, then go for a hosted/managed solution like Shopify or Magento Go. Else, you really need an actual ecommerce framework that you can customize. Of course, customizing Magento is like trying to turn your pubic hairs into silk...., The most important things are customers and referrals. :) \\n\\nAs for a website, you can use things like  shopify, square space, and weebly. In this modern day, you don\\'t have to spend a great deal to setup a nice looking website. All of those I mentioned offer free versions or trials.\\n\\nAlso ask yourself how you\\'ll do order fulfilment. Is the audience of this business going to be local or very large? Are you going to ship pies yourself? Just bring business to your location?\\n\\nOne thing about selling on the internet is finding an audience. Often times things like teaching on youtube can build trust with an audience, and build a brand. If your audience is large enough, and you can convince even just 1% to pay you for your services, that may be enough to make it worthwhile. It may not even be with selling pies but other things you can do. Who knows!\\n\\nLearn and read as much as you can about doing business on the internet. Sites like news.ycombinator.com are helpful but they are way more oriented towards tech.\\n\\nFinally, don\\'t be afraid. :) , Holy shit.

With meta fields you can attach any additional info to a product e.g a secondary description, a video embed code, etc. Meta fields are a powerful native Shopify feature but you cannot access or create them natively in the admin, you need to use a tool or an app to create and edit them. \\n\\nOn Mobile so pardon for not linking but check out  FreakDesign\\'s ShopifyFD and Custom Fields chrome extensions. There\\'s a bit of setup involved ( follow instructions in his docs ) to create the meta fields and then implement them into your theme, but once they are set up it is easy to edit these right in the Shopify admin by using the custom fields chrome extension without having to add special wrapper code in your descriptions and using css or jquery to manipulate it.\\n\\nNote this does require some developer knowledge to initially setup in your theme, but once it\\'s running, the custom fields chrome extension makes it very easy for non-technical people to edit this information without having to know html. Good luck!, Thanks a lot for your feedback!\\n\\nIs the manual work required for the products, the customers/orders, or both?\\n\\nThere are only 150 products on the site, however there are approximately 1000 customers, 1500 orders.  The products are easy enough to correct because there aren\\'t that many, however the customers and orders would be much more time consuming.\\n \\nAnother concern is losing SEO--the company has spent much effort and $ on gaining SEO.  Cart2Cart claims that it can preserve SEO by maintaining category and product url\\'s.\\n\\nAs I understand it, some work needs to be done by a developer to maintain the SEO including generate a sitemap\\nsetting 301 redirects for all pages, and\\ncreating a custom 404 page.  I\\'m wondering if I should just have a dev migrate everything and do this other stuff at the same time?  I need to get this right as there is a lot at stake, the store can\\'t afford to take an SEO hit., Hi Ladies :) \\n\\nThis sub has been a little quiet lately so I was hoping we could start discussing our spring favorites!\\n\\nMy top three picks are:\\n\\n1) [Kimmie Crops](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0320/3241/products/0314059-020AU811519ARAB-4_grande.jpg?v=1396131868) from 7 For All Man Kind. They have a 26\\'\\' inseam (whooo) so there isn\\'t too much fabric left over when I roll them up a little bit. I picked the medium dark wash because it\\'s the most flattering color on me. I purchased these from Belk a month ago when they were on sale for $138. \\n\\n2) [Supergas](http://www.superga.co.uk/images/products/verylarge/b51c4fd3340776a20b5d4cab4441581a.jpg)-- an Italian classic! I\\'ve owned white Keds, Vans and Converses but Supergas have to be my most favorite canvas sneaker. Not a lot of girls on my campus have them except for the ones who vacation regularly in Europe (no joke...) and Madewell fans. I\\'m contemplating getting the navy pair of the platform pair in the near future.\\n\\n3) [Linen tanks](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/women-modal-linen-tank-top-136327.html#69~/women/tops/tanks-and-camis/tank-tops/~) from Uniqlo. These babies are loose and easy to dress up and down. I also just ordered some of these [drape tanks](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/women-drape-tank-top-158024.html#56~/women/tops/tanks-and-camis/tank-tops/~) and I\\'m pretty sure they will be a new staple as well. \\n\\nMy style is very laid back and since I\\'m usually in summer school or doing on campus research from May- July, I don\\'t feel the need to dress up too much :) , I just wrote a whole thing and my login timed out so this will be a brief version as I\\'m on mobile.\\n\\nWe had one store with about 7k skus in magento and 10k blog posts from Wordpress. With Shopify, just changing all these links and launching fresh will give you a big seo hit upfront, but google is pretty smart and you\\'ll soon be way back up in organic search rankings ( Shopify is great with seo if you set up your theme correctly - use schema.org and open graph to add extra power ). What was more important was maintaining all the years of backlinks from social posts and other blogs and such linking back to the site.\\n\\nSo in this particular instance, we exported  all the magento and Wordpress urls into a spreadsheet and ran some formulas to convert them into Shopify-friendly urls. The systems all have different url structures and we need to know what the Shopify equivalent would be.\\n\\nOnce we had all the old urls and the new Shopify urls we wanted, we created a quick and dirty \\'app\\' we just ran through the command line to bulk create these redirects through the Shopify api https://docs.shopify.com/api/redirect. I\\'m oversimplifying here for the sake of discussing concept, but it worked great.\\n\\nAfter running the custom app and creating the redirects, we added in the new products in bulk fresh through Shopify\\'s product import csv file making sure the product handles matched up to what we imported as redirects. We used Shopify\\'s Wordpress importer to handle the blog posts. With a bit of tweaking and trial and error, we got it all working and preserved all the links and never took a big initial hit on seo and more importantly didn\\'t kill everyone else linking to the site.\\n\\nIt is a task for a developer but it definitely can be done. And while I wouldn\\'t say it was a fun process. It was certainly more fun that just breaking everything and way more fun than spending weeks entering everything back in manually. Good luck!\\n\\nEdit: lots of autocorrect iPhone typos. , [still my favorite shirt](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0128/9452/products/Carry-Hard_b739e9bb-79c8-4a76-812d-adc9deec148e_1024x1024.png?v=1429083652), http://enbluetec.myshopify.com/products/copy-of-premium-one-w3-triple-dock-charging-stand-for-apple-watch-iphone-and-ipad\\n\\nI ordered this..

People see that there is no harm in seeing the final cost of the item without risking their credit card. Muon will always have a percentage of customers doing this though, try comparing yours to industry averages  \\nOr more likely they realise at the end of the checkout process they have to do a direct deposit which is a lot riskier then a credit card transaction which can be cancelled. That drives them away. \\nI would make sure that your reasons for using bank deposit are clear or you make it clear that this is your chosen payment method. Also from experience make sure you provide an order number straight away which the customer can use to see if there order has been fulfilled. \\nIf you can confirm that it isn\\'t a simple fact of customers being driven off by the idea of having to direct deposit (I am Personally hesitant to do this with any store that does not have good feedback an reviews), then I guess you could try to make the checkout process a bit more \\'committing\\' or as easy as possible for the customer. Maybe have a order notification sent to the customer with the items and order number and all your bank details + amount saying \\'your items are being collected\\' , Per you\\'re questions, I agree that you should run this from home for a while. You can normally do the startup in the evening/ weekend and keep your fulltime job during the day. \\n\\nSpecifically, you\\'re question about the pro\\'s and con\\'s of running your own business. I\\'m not sure if it just my experience, but I felt as though when I had my own businesses on my resume it negatively impacted getting another job. I ended up calling myself \"lead programmer\" since it seems to convey your skills without making people think you\\'re going to jump ship. When they do ask about it, I simply say that it was/ is a side project I have. \\n\\nOne major expense for companies handling physical objects is the cash management system. If you are planning on doing most of your work online, you\\'re fine. However, systems like Shopify\\'s POS system can cost 1000+ depending on what equipment you already have., Side projects are awesome for your creativity, to boost your resume, and to practice skills that you might not otherwise use in your normal day job. I was underutilized in my previous day job, and managed to bring five side projects to market with nights / weekends work. it was the only thing I had to talk about that time period during later job interviews.\\n\\nI\\'d recommend setting up something on squarespace or shopify to give yourself a more professional look. go for it!, Recently i\\'ve picked up:\\n\\n- [Wings and Horns Field jacket](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0161/7586/products/0X5A2520_1024x1024.jpg?v=1429290589)\\n\\n- [Viberg fatty calf derbies](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0211/7310/products/DS_Black_Fatty_Calf2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1429569655)\\n\\n- [White Mountaineering x Barbour quilted jacket](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0051/7042/products/QuiltedStitchJacketNavy1_cbe876ff-76c9-43f0-ba03-a169f833405a_1024x1024.jpg?v=1427570588), Why did you use Shopify?

If you cant figure out how to remove those little rivets or blocks, then I have to wonder if you can tie your shoes, or check the oil in your car.\\n\\nI could remove one of those magazine limiters in the same time it would take to fully load one. If you are mechanically inclined enough to figure out how to load and work a gun, then this is simple.\\n\\nEspecially when school shooters(the ones that actually succeed) tend to spend a lot of time practicing, modifying their guns, hell some of them spend time researching and building bombs.\\n\\nDrilling out a 2cent rivet is quite literally no problem to anyone actually intent on causing this sort of carnage.\\n\\nThe other loophole magazines are commonly available in stores, everyone up here owns them, and all sorts of rednecks remove magazine limiters on their own even just for fun(despite it being very illegal).\\n\\nMagazine limits are the functional equivalent of selling sports cars with a block of wood glued underneath the gas pedal to prevent people from speeding or street racing.\\n\\nIf my description is long it is because i was trying to be informative. If you want it in terms that the average criminal can understand: \"Look man, this 15 round glock mag only loads ten rounds! oh look at that rivet on the side of the mag, what happens if I pull that out?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nRegardless, some of the deadliest school shootings in the USA have been done with 10 round mags(like Columbine, or Virginia tech, or sandy hook, where he compulsively reloded magazines with more than half the bullets still left in them), because even with limited magazines, you can easily carry more of them and swap them out in [1-2 seconds.](http://i.imgur.com/a38pw24.webm)\\n\\nIt is a solution in name only. Even under ideal circumstances(criminals regress to pre human lack of knowledge about tool but still manage to operate firearms, loophole mags stop existing, the current million unlimited mags suddenly dissappear) they only possibly affect a very tiny statistical outlier of actual firearms crime, and not enough to make a real difference given that mags can be swapped out in seconds.\\n\\nCanada has been restricting mags for decades, and yet people shooting at cans still have them illegally. A potential shooter is 20 seconds with a drill away from loading up however many bullets they want. What makes you think the USA would have better compliance?, I\\'m looking for help to create some screensavers with graphics that exist already and  have them uploaded on my Shopify store [shopgasoline](http://www.shopgasoline.com) freebies (so users can download them). If you can help me with that, I can help you with learning French (for example!). Thanks!, Shopify is a good platform.\\n\\nSome of their biggest stores are UAV sellers., I\\'m in the process of setting up my first Shopify store and was planning on asking for some direction on implementing this type of integration. That being said and for what it\\'s worth, you have my vote., Been there done that x 100. I wouldn\\'t do it with the current platform. There\\'s no upside unless you have a plan to turn the monthly maintenance into something substantial. I\\'m moving nearly all my clients off of monthly billing.\\n\\nWhat I recommend is that you put your name in the hat as being another designer/developer who thinks Squarespace should build better tools for site managers and builders like us. I\\'ve beat the horse to death talking about this to them and I\\'ve seen no progress in over 3 years of this new platform.\\n\\nShopify\\'s Partners Program has everything I wish Squarespace had, including recurring revenue for sites you setup, themes/apps tied to your account, and more.\\n\\nPlease submit a feature request for this at customercare@squarespace.com so they have another data point., mknweb i\\'m working in this business.\\n right now i just call customers meet them buy their smartphones or tablets... but this is time counsuming so i figured i would start a website like your so i don\\'t have to constantly call, arrange a meeting, test the device etc, in my country there is only 2-3 websites that specialize in the recycling business and they are crappy so i\\'m pretty sure i have my chance\\nbut the problem is that i\\'m a complete noob when it come to Ecommerce, i don\\'t know what plateform should i use to make a website like your\\ni tought about shopify but i don\\'t know if it\\'s suited for my need since i\\'m not going to sell through the website just buy from customers\\ndo you have advices ?, [Jane &amp; Rye?](http://jane-rye.myshopify.com/collections/femme/bague) They\\'re from Montreal!, I love your site.  I totally would use shopify knowing what I know now.  Great value, usability, etc.\\n\\nRetail is a tough business.  Any retail.  You\\'ve already got traction and the rest is just adding on to that.  Good news.  People love new clothes!  \\n\\nI checked out your social media accounts.  There\\'s really nice work there; keep it up!  Your twitter engagement is off for your follower count, but that\\'s all I saw that was \"off\".\\n\\nOn your website, do you have a way to add a block to your header or footer?  If so, I would create a view of all of your sale items, organized by their discount percentages, so people can jump right too them then link on every page to those items.  It\\'s a solid draw for any retail site, as price is probably our biggest differentiator.\\n\\nEven a menu link to those items would help.  I wouldn\\'t hestitate to say something like \"Check out our 50% off items from popular vendor 1, 2, 3\".  Price conscious folks are going to be all over it.  Anything at 20% off or more is heroin for savvy shoppers. 40% is irresistible and I think you have items even lower than that.  Get them to add that to their carts and maybe they\\'ll keep shopping and items at regular price.\\n\\nI used to have two vendors that had strong customer loyalty and offer 20% off on everything they did even the latest release.  A discount none of my competitors would do.  I received a lot of buzz from that.  I did it for a year and it was a great way to build my customer base.  The point is to build the customer base more than profit per sale.  Profit per sale is important, of course, but my goal is to get you to purchase regularly and your business is perfect for that, as well.\\n\\nI would keep drilling into your sales history, looking for purchasing patterns and emailing those guys when new releases come in.\\n\\nA way to get some more social media attention is to hold a contest.  Get people to do something interesting for a prize: gift certificate, visa gift card, apparel, whatever.   Possibly even a call-to-action without the award to ask users to share them wearing your apparel out and about it and hash tagging it.  Then you re-share it throughout your social media accounts.  Instant content and no work for you.  I would have a page on your site that features all of those contributions (as appropriate).\\n\\nYou want original content for your site, shareable items on social media, etc and that\\'s a fun way to do it.  One of my big dreams is to have a mobile app, so it\\'s easy to share this directly to my site.  , Canada Computers , NCIX , Shopify , chairs4gaming, Rogers, Bell , Telus, Blackberry., We\\'re not making a great deal of profit on the tshirts and $24.99 is actually par for the course. Unlike other companies making bitcoin tshirts we are using premium garments and screenprinting methods; we don\\'t want to sacrifice quality for quantity. Ordering in multiples of 100+, the blank t-shirts alone cost us $10. Then you have to factor in design work, packaging materials, cost of screenprinting (screens, inks and labor,) hosting a shopify website, freebies that are included, etc. Of course we can always use cheap tshirts and an inferior method of printing direct to garment; its definitely an option. This is one reason I created this post, if people are looking for cheaper options we can make that happen. The tradeoff is that the shirts won\\'t be as comfortable and the designs will fade after 2 or 3 times in the washer., What about Paywhirl?\\n\\nhttps://apps.shopify.com/paywhirl-recurring-payments, [Chicago Diner](http://chicago-diner-webstore.myshopify.com/products/the-new-chicago-diner-cookbook-w-bonus-pack-2) Best vegan diner food from Chicago.

I realize this is probably(?) just a shopify template, but I loved that it scrolled to the side rather than pushing the form info down. I only went this far because I didn\\'t feel like filling out info.\\n\\nMy only complaint in the Checkout is where it goes \"PayPal or Customer Information\". Might want to give it a similar title like \"Credit Card\". It threw me off a little, but I was browsing your sight while smoking a bowl. \\n\\n\\nOther than than, looks great. How big is the operation?\\n\\n\\n, Good points. I was just planning to use Stripe\\'s webhooks to get a notification whenever a subscription was charged, and our app would just create the order in Shopify. That way we manage all the customer and subscription logic within Stripe, and I don\\'t have to build out any front-end UI.\\n\\nBut that doesn\\'t give customers any way to cancel, and doesn\\'t handle inventory levels. So you\\'re right that we would need to build the subscription logic ourselves, too., Hi, thanks for your reply!

That includes workarounds, such as inserting custom code into the product descriptions.  , Stop! Don\\'t use Wix. It\\'s so simple to create a professional website with Wordpress. Wix isn\\'t as SEO friendly as Wordpress so could damage you in the long run. Have you looked at Shopify for an eCommerce store?\\n\\nAs far as subscription payments go, there are plenty of plugins etc that you could use. MoonClerk, Chargify, ChargeBee etc.\\n\\nWhen you say the availability is awful, what do you mean exactly?, Have you checked out a SaaS product like Shopify?, Why do you think one will outgrow Shopify? I have a little shop that I wrote myself (webdev), integrated Stripe and Bitcoin payments, coupons etc. It\\'s all running fine.\\n\\nJust can\\'t stop thinking that it would be better for the business to not have to worry about coding., Okay! I\\'ve stopped. I wont use WIX then. Do you know of any online courses on how to use Wordpress or is that not needed? I have not checked shopify out, never heard of them. I will now though!\\nOkay, thank you so, so much! Great suggestions! \\n\\nWell, I mean that they have really bad websites and buying their products is really bothersome. You really have to try and search to find out how to get them, and thats not very good is it! It\\'s all just to inaccessible. So I\\'m trying to set up some solutions that looks good and is easy to use for the consumer.

Will definitely be implementing this note.\\n\\nI use Shopify and yes, I do it all myself, Would you be able to use shopify and cratejoy? for example use shopify on your main page.

Shopify\\'s concept wouldn\\'t technically work and would be a poor experience.  , You can edit HTML/CSS via the template editor in Trial.  \\nI talked to staff and they told me that CSS in product descriptions is blocked for all user levels, paid or otherwise., I talked to staff and they told me that CSS in product descriptions is blocked for all user levels, paid or otherwise.

As the Open Bazaar sites are decentralised, it also makes them independent services that can\\'t be lent on like companies can lean on Ebay et al. in order to shut down their business, even though what they are doing is not in fact illegal., Interesting.

We offer a series of coffee classes to the public. Proper coffee brewing involves looking at the process from a scientific perspective. Present the club as a brewing methods club. Learning the composition of the coffee itself (the acids, lipids, gasses, etc- and how all those things affect taste) How their chemical make up changes during brewing, and how each method of brewing does different things. (For example- a chemex brings out more acidic elements of the bean, causing it to taste more fruity. While french press has no paper filter, so it does not strain out the lipids and you get a coffee with a VERY different mouth feel. \\n\\nLet me know if you need any help!    \\n\\n\\nTo give you an idea of what kind of things to do- look at the classes different coffee companies offer:\\n\\n**Irving Farm**: \\nhttp://www.eventbrite.com/o/irving-farm-coffee-roasters-4179185945\\n\\n**Joe the Art of Coffee**: \\nhttp://joecoffeeshop.myshopify.com/collections/classes\\n\\nCounter Culture:\\nhttps://counterculturecoffee.com/learn/course-catalogue, [Slightly Higher Res](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0211/4926/files/P-MegaBeer_Zoom1001_192c6a82-7682-4102-affc-d5dc08ca4bef.jpg?8482)\\n\\nI saw this posted by Deadspin a year or two ago. , TSM has their own store :\\nhttp://solomidstore.myshopify.com\\n\\nI don\\'t know if UOL has something, but you might want to try and find a design at redbubble.\\n\\n, I\\'m thinking of getting [these deerskin boots](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0051/7042/products/DeerskinRanchBoots_1024x1024.jpg?v=1417305272).

He can\\'t send payments to customers from shopify can he? Or reliably store bank account information for every client. , Consult the [chart](https://i.imgur.com/Dt1bhC8.jpg).\\n\\n[better quality, not imgur](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0211/4926/files/P-Pasta_Zoom_0806.jpg), I mean it would suck for you to invest $5k to startup, then get no traffic, have no demand, and lose your 5k. You could get started on a hosted platform like big commerce, shopify, or non ecomm platforms like weebly and square space, and the most you would be out is a few hundred bucks and a little time., Our site is on Shopify, so it was seamless to use their processing. The fees aren\\'t too bad for the volume we\\'re doing. If we had higher transactional volume, larger transactions, etc I\\'d look into negotiating a better rate through a major card processor. There are a number of processing options - but in reality they\\'re all pretty similar unless you\\'re transacting a ton (then you need to work with someone that can customize a plan to your needs and get you better rates).\\n, eBay and Amazon are fairly easy, things like Magento with M2EPro plugin will do it and it\\'s all free minus the cost of hosting. Though it\\'s still going to be FAR easier if you choose one or the other. inkFrog is great but it only does eBay listings from Shopify, BigCommerce, and Highwire. \\n\\nPersonally I\\'ve gone to Wordpress with WooCommerce and eBay plugins, the used items I sell just don\\'t lend themselves to Amazon and both Shopify/BigCommerce weren\\'t getting great SEO results even though Shopify with inkFrog was dead simple. I got a proper server for WordPress and made sure my page load times are under a second, keep a decent blog with no copy/paste content, and it gets the best results for me.\\n\\nCL, not going to happen. Even if a piece of software took your listings and put them on CL your listings would get ghosted as you\\'re most likely posting more than once per account every 48 hours or so. CL you\\'re best using automated posting software and getting/making a whole ton of verified CL accounts, then post a generic ad for your company rather than trying to multichannel list items to them. Doing CL ads well is an entirely different ball game., Wayyyyy too much technical jargon on there. Great for people like us, not so great for the general public.  Definitely doesn\\'t say \"simple\" to me. \\n\\nIf this is aimed at the same demo as Shopify and Square and the like then you need to dumb down your pitch.  Do it in the top paragraph.  Create relatable images.  Leave the technical stuff for when you scroll down below.  \\n\\nIf it\\'s aimed at an entirely different demo then I stand corrected.\\n\\nQuick Edit:  You\\'ve done an amazing job on your product.

I launch publicly May 1st, i\\'m hoping to get a few sales., Yeah.  This campaign is more technically inclined but I might create dumbed down brands in the future.\\n\\nI want to get the platform out there, and from there I want to work on customer facing implementations.\\n\\nHowever, I\\'ll be offering shopify style services early on, and will try and funnel end users to it instead of the campaign.\\n\\nIt\\'s for a wide range of people and not everything applies to everyone, but I\\'m going to try and order it more logically like wading into a pool.\\n\\nEdit: I\\'ll definitely be creating a new campaign image minus the jargon.

If you are setting up a ecommerce website, consider getting a one stop shop like bigcommerce or shopify., The problem with Shopify is not the fixed ~50/mo cost. It\\'s the commission fee. \\n\\nI know you are going to say 2% is nothing.  It is. Margins in eCommerce are razor-thin. Especially if you run a drop shipping business.\\n\\nWooCommerce is great for &lt;1000 products. Also, if you have experience with Wordpress, then WooCommerce is a no-brainer. The interface of WooCommerce is like Wordpress. You\\'ll feel pretty familiar with WooCommerce once you add a couple of products.\\n\\n&gt;Basic shipping calculation (including flat rate) and product variations are essential.\\n\\nWC does have some basic shipping calculations, based on regions. \\n\\nProduct variations work fine in WooCommerce. Although, in my opinion, if you have dozens of variations to add - the interface doesn\\'t come as handy and it\\'s quite fiddly.\\n\\nYou said you have ten products, but you didn\\'t mention how many variations you have to add. One thing I learned in eCommerce is not to think products but think variations. Most online software use variations as a reference point, and not products., so what should i do ? go with magento? shopify?  bigcommerce? wordpress? something else ? i\\'m lost\\n\\nkeep in mind that i already work in this field but instead of having a dedicated website, i just arrange a meeting with my customers and buy from them but this is time consuming, this why i would like to setup a website, just get the same shoes in girls sizes. sk8 hi, af1, stan smiths...pretty much all sneakers recommended on here look good on women\\n\\nthen just get some tight denim or joggers and wear a white black or gray tee. basic but you\\'ll look better than 95% of chicks out there\\n\\nnot super streetwear but damn this chick looks good: http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0166/6656/files/stan_smith_d_grande.jpg?10048, I do on PolyPlane.com via Fastwagon. \\nI also do via Shopify for YawningFish.com. \\n\\nBecause I pay an integrated fee on YF, I feel like this is a much better experience for my customers.

Buying online is common place these days, and buying online is global. Everybody knows that the currency is as stated and billed in the vendor\\'s currency, and your CC will handle the conversion to your local.\\n\\nDo you advertise that you are a \\'Canadian Company\\' and act all Canadian, eh? ......and then find friction when your Canuck customers see USD\\'s on their CC bill? Almost to be expected, I\\'d think. The messaging is wrong, why would a Canadian company bill in USD\\'s?\\n\\nI ran a Canadian based shopify store, and we billed in Canadian dollars, and over 90% of our sales were to Americans. Never an issue with CDN $ product prices and shipping costs converted to USD\\'s by our clients credit card companies.\\n\\nIn short: no need for 2 sites, but you need to clean up your messaging and set better expectations for your clients for currency issues., Could you provide more info about the local Cleveland shop?\\n\\nJust a shopify store... and I think it\\'s fair to be a little skeptical seeing the way people are always trying to push their T\\'s via Reddit.

Did any of these places inspire your art? Write about that and let us know. It looks like you\\'ve had some great success as an artist, so I\\'d like to know more about you, but not in the sense that everything is Christopher does this. Christopher does that. I want to know more about you in the sense of your art, how these places inspired you, and how it helped you create. \\n\\nFor your email newsletter at the bottom, there is absolutely no reason to sign up.

The more email subscirbers you get, the more you can lead people back to your site!\\n\\nI don\\'t have a lot of advice for your site, but I hope it helps a little. \\n\\n, [How about this?](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/0002/products/OrangeDunkPrintStore_grande.jpg?v=1420829209), That is Shopify\\'s Liquid. , Recent Submission history for SkidmarkSkatemag:\\n\\ndomain submitted from|count|%\\n:-|-:|-:\\n[skidmarkskatemag.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27skidmarkskatemag.com%27+author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|68|66%\\n[i.imgur.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27i.imgur.com%27+author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|14|14%\\n[vimeo.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27vimeo.com%27+author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|4|4%\\n[facebook.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27facebook.com%27+author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|4|4%\\n[youtube.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27youtube.com%27+author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|3|3%\\n[imgur.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27imgur.com%27+author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|3|3%\\n[youtu.be](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27youtu.be%27+author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|2|2%\\n[digital-skidmarkskatemag.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27digital-skidmarkskatemag.com%27+author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|1|1%\\n[joom.ag](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27joom.ag%27+author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|1|1%\\n[meeksterbraustore.bigcartel.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27meeksterbraustore.bigcartel.com%27+author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|1|1%\\n[cdn.shopify.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27cdn.shopify.com%27+author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|1|1%\\n[joomag.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27joomag.com%27+author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|1|1%\\n\\nsubreddit submitted to|count|%\\n:-|-:|-:\\n[skateboarding](/r/skateboarding/search?q=author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|86|83%\\n[skateboardcirclejerk](/r/skateboardcirclejerk/search?q=author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|7|7%\\n[skateparks](/r/skateparks/search?q=author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|2|2%\\n[funny](/r/funny/search?q=author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|2|2%\\n[Models](/r/Models/search?q=author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|1|1%\\n[funnyvideos](/r/funnyvideos/search?q=author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|1|1%\\n[Skatespotsonreddit](/r/Skatespotsonreddit/search?q=author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|1|1%\\n[gifs](/r/gifs/search?q=author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|1|1%\\n[Bondi](/r/Bondi/search?q=author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|1|1%\\n[Instagram](/r/Instagram/search?q=author%3A%27SkidmarkSkatemag%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|1|1%, If you\\'re just looking to create a site as soon as possible, then go with Wordpress.

Unless you can sell your product as super-premium, I think you need to reevaluate your pricing.  I don\\'t necessarily think that your site is going to do you any favors.  There\\'s a time for whitespace and monochromatic color schemes.  This is not that time.  You need huge overwhelming super-satured posh images to flip the visitor into a \"wow\" mindset.  [Something like this, maybe.](http://infinity-39.myshopify.com/), Great work! Getting it started is the hardest part. Also know that you are going to be flooded with advice, blogs, etc suggesting you do things that may or may not be relevant.  And as a small business owner jumping into the world of ecommerce that can be very daunting and overwhelming to try and figure out what advice and suggestions to take, what platforms to use, etc. - So take what I am about to say for what it is worth. \\n\\n1.] Because you are using Shopify, I would try and have your email popup happen on the second page or after a click.  Currently, you are asking the visitor to subscribe to your email without really knowing who you are.  And after they click exit, they won\\'t be prompted again to subscribe until their next visit.  But if they click into your site, they have obvious interest and the likelyhood of an email subscribe conversion increases greatly.\\n\\n2.] Before spending money on ads, promotion of any kind, or even reaching out to bloggers - all very laborious, most of the time expensive, and the results not always have a positive ROI / ROE (return on effort).  The big question is: WHERE DOES YOUR MARKET SPEND THEIR TIME?  Your bread and butter market probably doesn\\'t spend their time searching on google. And your inventory doesn\\'t seem to warrant heavy ad spend, because its unique one quantity items. You may spend $1,000 dollars on accident because people were interested in an a dress that was purchased by the first buyer.  Google ads work best when hyper specific, which means, until you have a larger brand awareness and larger inventory plus a large marketing budget, Google is likely not to warrant the best results.\\n\\n3.] So I would assume that your audience is the fashion forward, the one who is unique, puts effort into their wardrobe, and likely photographs their finds, and outfits.  So I would take to Instagram.  And you have in some regard.  But I would suggest going a step further.  Who has bought your items in the past? Look at their instagrams, see if they are wearing any of the purchases they made from you. Then feature them. Give them credit. Free.  People in photos result in higher engagement.  Also, take note of what they are wearing these items with - other brands, accessories, etc.  Are they style bloggers in doing streetstyle photos, are they formal events, are they everyday business? This gives you a good idea of the context by which you should style these photos.\\n\\n4.] Actionable: Identify Instagram users who have purchased your products or consistently engage with your photos.  See if they have posted great images wearing your products, or products that fit your market.  You are a curator of vintage apparel so promoting vintage broadly is ok.  For instance you see that one of your followers has a great photo wearing a 1955 Sleeveless Dress, along with a Brand A shoes, Brand B jewelry, and Brand C clutch.  The photo was taken by her best friend who is a photographer.  You get the image, either by screenshot (dont use repost app) or by downloading it various ways.  And you write something like this: \"We are absolutely in love with how @username is rocking this #vintage 1955 Sleeveless Dress paired with @BrandA pumps, @BrandB necklace, and @BrandC clutch at the Rock the Raffle event last night in DC. #yourhashtag #ImportantAudienceRelevantHashtags\" Tag the photographer, user and brands and even the event in the picture and post!  Rinse, repeat. \\n\\nYou may not see immediate results, but over time, and shouldnt be that much time if you stay at it, you will have a following coming to your feed to see the amazing features you have of vintage wear.  And...  they will want to be featured.  So in your bio, include a statement that say use some hashtag to be featured.  The important thing to remember is that you are building an audience of those interested in vintage wear.  It may not be immediate, but as you grow this audience you will have much higher rates of conversion because you are in front of your audience.  And its free.  \\n\\nAs you move forward, fold your products into the feed, but make them relate to the context.  Almost as if they couldnt tell that you were selling them on something.  But because they love it, they will try and get it if it is available.  Each time you post a product in your feed, change your website url to that product so that they can easily get to it.  These are one of a kind items so once your audience is engaged and interested, by the time you post your next product, the last will be gone and you can change the link without hesitation.\\n\\nBuild your community, feature people, recognize your audiences context.  Instagram is truly an amazing community, but a much greater tool if used correctly.  I would be willing to share more tips and thoughts if interested.  I have successfully done the above with and for numerous companies now and currently am carrying it out for a company.  With 30,000 followers (all real and organic) in 3 months, and almost 5,000 engagements a day.  PM if you have any questions.  I apologize for the long message, it likely has a lot of mistakes., I recently discovered moon cheese. Very satisfying crunchy snack! \\nhttp://moon-cheese.myshopify.com/products/cheddar-moon-cheese, What ecommerce platform are you using?\\n\\nUse a third party payment gateway. I am also in the process of rebranding and rebuilding an ecommerce website and my client already has an account with authorize.net CIM\\n\\nThis means that whenever credit card data is entered, its securely transferrd to authorize.net, who handles the charging of the credit card. This ensures you are PCI compliant. Because of the CIM functionality, I store a token for a customer which can be used to retrieve their credit card information from authorize.net, and allows the customer to re-use their card if they come back for a follow up purchase. \\n\\nYou may want to look into a full-fledged solution like shopify. But NO NONO, do not store customer credit card data under any circumstances.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested, i\\'m using https://spreecommerce.com/ which uses https://github.com/Shopify/active_merchant and it supports a LOT of payment gateways., Did it all by myself, pretty simple.\\n\\nStarted with the Startup Theme\\nhttps://themes.shopify.com/themes/startup/styles/home, Wow this can\\'t be for real?\\n\\nHire a company who knows what they\\'re dealing with.

I still had to cut it off since I hit Reddit\\'s maximum characters allowed.\\n\\n-----------------------\\n\\n##**11 months ago I quit my job and have had over 13,000 orders since.**\\n\\nHow did I do it? I\\'ll tell you how! This start-up guide is for wantrepreneurs that want to leave behind their cubicle and create fantastic opportunities for your family and jobs people cherish - just like I did. Shopify is a robust platform that enables anyone to start selling something today.\\n\\n##Where to start... isn\\'t that the hardest part?\\n\\nThe best method is to find products that interest you and get creative juices flowing. Go on Alibaba.com, Etsy.com, or google \"shopping\" search for product ideas. Alibaba is a huge amazon-like company for wholesalers and manufacturers to show their goods. The nice thing about this website is that these companies can also make custom items for you, whether it be apparel, electronics, or more unique offerings. Start off small and stay focused. To date, Shirtwascash, has mostly stuck to just t-shirts and now we\\'re finally in a position to really expand on that. We make everything locally and I\\'m glad we did but a lot of others source their products elsewhere.\\n\\n**You don\\'t need to change the world to change your life.** Too many entrepreneurs, especially within start-up culture, feel the need to create something revolutionary and untested. One of the companies that first got me thinking outside of the \"change the world\" mindset was an awesome brand selling beard kits and supplies for men. They had an awesome brand, concise message of quality, and he was doing 5-figure sales every month. Finding a niche that interests you is very important but not necessary.\\n\\nNiches are very important, however. Make sure you know (and preferably can relate to) your target audience. Somehow within the saturated apparel market, Shirtwascash was able to stand out as unique, fun, and our quality keeps bringing people (and their friends!) back. I suggest your mindset me more about \"I can do this better than website XYZ\" rather than \"what is something that\\'s never been done before?!\"\\n\\nOnce you have some products you\\'d like to create, buy wholesale, or sell in general - it\\'s time to move on to the next step!\\n\\n##Creating the perfect brand should be easy!\\n\\nBranding is super important. It builds confidence in your potential customers if done properly and gives their memory a point of reference in the future. Making your brand stand out is the most important part to really make a sustainable business that converts to sales. Shirtwascash got it\\'s name from a random poster online. While we were testing the idea for feedback, someone commented \"those shirts are cash\", and it stuck. I spent very little time picking colors or other non-essential timesinks. Just stick to the necessary things and develop it as you go.\\n\\nOnce you know the products you want to sell, the name, and have a general idea about how you want the brand to look, create a Shopify store for a free trial. Our blog about \"How I made $40k within Shopify\\'s Trial Period\" may interest you to know how we launched.\\n\\n##Setting up Shopify\\n\\nWe are going to briefly go over how to set up Shopify. You can skip this if you\\'d like because it\\'s rather straightforward if you have experience online. That said, I highly suggest you create / modify your own theme, add the products, and do all of the heavy lifting. This is one of the most simple aspects to learn and if you\\'re too lazy to figure this out, you\\'re probably not going to succeed.\\n\\nThe first thing is to create an awesome looking store. Shopify makes this easy through Themes. There are free options and more professional ones. If you just want to test this out, keep your costs down as much as possible! Go with a free one. You can view all of Shopify\\'s themes here. We bought ours from their store and I customized the hell out of it. Making the perfect theme takes time and effects sales, but your products are more important and will drive sales (if people want them).\\n\\nOnce you find a Theme you want to use, customizing it is the best time to really create that perfect brand. Selecting colors and making minor adjustments is usually built into the Theme you bought. Go to Online Store -&gt; Themes on the left and you\\'ll see something like this:\\n\\n*[Missing image]*\\n \\nNow you can play with all of your Theme\\'s options on the right and see how it looks in real-time on the left. If your theme doesn\\'t have a lot of options, you should consider finding a new one.\\n\\n##Once you have awesome website, add products!\\n\\nAdding products on Shopify is really easy. Just click \"Products\" on the left and \"Add a product\" on the top right. You\\'ll see something like this:\\n\\n*[Missing image]*\\n\\nCreating your Theme and adding products will be a trial and error thing but once you get the process down, it\\'ll go really fast. Be sure to add products into Categories to make the customer experience better. Also, pictures are king. Real product pictures is an art but you don\\'t need to spend a lot of time doing that in the beginning. Just get some products up, make the website look trustworthy, and try to make some sales.\\n\\n##I don\\'t have enough money to start a business (and other wantrepreneur excuses).\\n\\nThis is probably the most common excuse I hear from wantrepreneurs. The good news is, you don\\'t need any money to make money! You might need to change what you\\'re selling or how you\\'re initially selling it based on your finances. I highly suggest not spending ANY money until you have sales. If you can\\'t drive sales, then why bother gambling the kids college fund?\\n\\nNow that you have an idea for products and a brand, you could try something like Kickstarter to get started but I suggest just sticking to Shopify. In the descriptions of your products and marketing, say This is a pre-order the most awesome blah. Or something like that. Do a pre-order over the span of two weeks to a month and set your initial sales goal to $10,000. Why $10,000? Because that\\'s what my pre-sales were, duh!\\n\\n##Okay, I have a website but NO ONE IS COMING!\\n\\nEvery first-time entrepreneur thinks customers will drop everything, spill spaghetti from their sleeves, and take out their wallets when you launch. Sadly, this isn\\'t reality. You have to drive traffic and then the market will let you know if it\\'s a good fit / product. Keep in mind that pieces of this step could (and probably should) happen before spending time creating a website. Market validation is the most important factor here. So, how do you drive traffic? Good news: there\\'s this thing called \"the internets\" !\\n\\n**Where you should post** is completely based on what type of products you sell. Since you did such a good job of knowing which niche you want to go after when selecting products, you should be able to find people that care on: Reddit, Instagram, blogs, Pinterest, Google+ groups (yeah, they\\'re alive), Wanelo, Polyvore, forums, twitter, facebook groups, and a ton of other places. If you have a particular type of design, try googling it\\'s keywords and see what comes up. Make a million accounts all over and create genuine posts for them.\\n\\n**What kind of posts you create** is based on your product type and the community you are posting to. If they like personal stories, make your story personable and be real. People like a well-written expression of what you\\'re doing. When we launched, we focused on getting out \"4chan designs shirts\". People loved how crazy that idea seemed and our products. Your posts can range from written posts looking for humble feedback, images of the products on relevant boards, and really anything. Being creative here and doing a lot of Googling to see what others (and competitors) did is extremely valuable.\\n\\nWe also suggest making your first potential customers feel special - because they are. I\\'ve been extremely community-focused since day 1. Our users were truly a part of our company from the start and watched us evolve. Which is another side point... internet people are stupid but not dumb. They\\'ve seen all types of advertising and marketing before. Make sure you are being real when you post and you understand how that community expects to be spoken to. Getting replies, upvotes, likes, etc, is the most important goal. Starting an email list (mailchimp.com) is an important tool too. Use that list to announce launch and keep people updated on orders.\\n\\nAnother trick is to use your competitor\\'s success to your advantage. Go to similarweb.com and type in your competitor\\'s websites. They will show you a lot of information for free. With this website, I can pretty much figure out how other apparel companies are generating sales online. It\\'s very useful.\\n\\n##People are coming but NO ONE IS BUYING!\\n\\nOnce you sell awesome products and put them in front of the right people, you should start to get sales. Keep in mind that 1% to 3% of the traffic you generate should convert to sales. If you are getting people to your website but no sales, then either your products need to be changed, how you present them, or you need to get the right type of visitors. Selling dog food to cat owners isn\\'t going to work out.\\n\\n*[Missing image]*\\n\\nIf you believe you have the right kind of traffic but still no sales, then it\\'s going to be that your products just aren\\'t up to snuff. My rule of thumb is that anything I think is awesome, is stupid and won\\'t sell. That is one reason I built my business to be user-submitted (crowd validation) designs but you can test your market in a lot of ways. I suggest not using your personal friends as your source of feedback. They won\\'t tell you the truth and probably know how much you want their approval. Anonymous internet people is my go-to and it\\'s free to talk to them. Here\\'s the formula for sales:\\n\\n**A Brand People Like + Truthworthy Website + Awesome Products They Want = Sales**, An okay read, but very little hard logistical information. I would not recommend it to anyone that isn\\'t looking to be sold on shopify.\\n\\nSorry op. , Have started working on [back handsprings](http://www.mindspillage.org/braindump/bhs.webm) on the floor (without using the [giant foam block](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0338/2113/products/boulder-green_1024x1024.jpg?v=1390866074) to catch me). Hoping to get it without a spotter soon!, The amount of legitimate companies selling through Shopify would surprise you then. I\\'ve seen the full range of potential uses and brands., This may be a dumb question, but from an execution standpoint, how do you communicate sales to the distributor to send the dropship? Is it something that you batch reports on a daily basis or do you have an arrangement where Shopify sends a notification to ship to the different distributors?\\n\\nThis is interesting timing for me, because I am looking to set up a online storefront where I\\'m selling product that I assemble and stock, but I would like to augment it with additional products to dropship., My thought is some innocent soul saying \"Hey, I like Peggle\" and googling for pegging, because they are related, at least by words you might use to describe the two \"games\".  Then they come [across this image](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0186/7330/files/pegging2.jpg) (nsfw/nsfmales).  They exclaim, \"My goodness!\"\\n\\nPondering the idea for a moment - the once clueless individual is now excited with the thought of trying it.  Their \"gaming\" life after-all has become boring and dull.\\n\\nThe female viewer sees this and says, \"I have mastered Peggle and will show my skills with moving balls on my significant other! What fun!\"\\n\\nThe male viewer sees this and says, \"I have always wanted to play Peggle with another man, but was always afraid something might go wrong.  But now I can try with my significant other.  She always says we don\\'t spend enough time snuggling!\"\\n\\nI am a redditor relationship fixer in many ways.  Repairing couples relationships through the power of Peg-gle., Not dumb at all, and it\\'s actually a pain point that I still haven\\'t automated.\\n\\nI communicate all of my orders to the distributors in Excel files via email. The file will have PO#, Name, Address, City, State, Zip, product SKU, and Quantity for each order, and that\\'s it. The distributor then handles the rest and bills me the next day for item cost + shipping + drop ship fee.\\n\\nShopify lets you export an/all orders in .csv, so it\\'s pretty easy to just open that baby in Excel and copy/paste the necessary information. \\n\\nThere are apps to automate this process, so I think if/when things get more sophisticated and it takes more than 10-15 minutes/day I\\'ll cough up the app fee, but from what I\\'ve seen it can be like $100/month for the app so it\\'s not particularly cheap, and in the meantime I\\'m just planning on doing it manually since it\\'s not a major time sink., Hey man, great read. \\n\\nI also had some success with shopify (www.Dicksbymail.com) and got over 30k in orders within the trial period. \\n\\nI got a bit lucky with going viral, but it\\'s an easy platform to use and it doesn\\'t take much to hack away some success.\\n\\nCheers to you man., I\\'m not talking about using Shopify, I\\'m talking about hiring a designer to take care of design for you.\\n\\nLike most of the legitimate companies do., Sent a bag of dicks to a friend, he posted on imgur and the the internet lost its mind. Top post of imgur within a day and shared on multiple blogs soon after. Only did like 3 interviews (a local dude, buzz feed and vice) because I was focused on sourcing product and fulfilling orders. Because of the jump to success I also looked into selling the site, but wound up taking on US partners (I\\'m Canadian) who were already established with a company and lawyers to make the whole thing easier. \\nThings have died down but still averaging 100 orders a day. \\n\\nI\\'m looking to still use shopify in the future for any other business ideas I have. Simple to use and very customizable.  Though I was a bit surprised they never tried to contact me to offer advice once we hit 6 figured inside 3 weeks., * Undergrad - Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

This theme is called Ella by HaloThemes. It\\'s paid, little over $100 I think. It kicks ass and their customer support is on point. I\\'ve found that the best Shopify themes are found outside the actual Shopify theme store. Check out http://themeforest.net/., &gt; Though I was a bit surprised they never tried to contact me to offer advice once we hit 6 figured inside 3 weeks.\\n\\nI think it has become more often an occurrence than you\\'d think now. My AMA had a shopify employee stop by and say we were the topic of their internal emails that day and gave some kind words but they really aren\\'t an incubator.\\n\\nI have noticed some opportunities they create for others though. Mostly within their self blogs but, funny enough, I literally emailed them this morning asking if they had other opportunities I didn\\'t know about.\\n\\nFeel free to email me anytime you want to bounce an idea off someone or anything.\\n\\nPS: I *highly* recommend entrepreneurs to check out Shopify\\'s blog. It is one of the more valuable resources I\\'ve found., If I went to this school I\\'d buy a ton of these:\\n\\nhttp://store-xkcd-com.myshopify.com/products/citation-needed-sticker-pack, I bought [these](http://one-off-fabrication.myshopify.com/collections/led-turn-signals) today.\\n\\nWith [this replacement relay.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BFXJGAQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\\n\\nIf you put those on the front, you\\'ll also [need these things.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00389Z5EG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), Have you thought of using a service like Ordoro? They integrate with Shopify and automate dropshipping. They also have a free tier., I really like that theme but I\\'m not really proficient with shopify and I don\\'t want to spend another 1000 bucks for a website + 500 for a professional photoshoot to test my idea.. do you really dislike the current website that much?, [I\\'ll just leave these here](http://harebrained.myshopify.com/), 1) Wave for accounting. It\\'s free. Also for quarterly sales reporting Shopify\\'s reporting system makes sales reporting easy and breaks down sales tax by county for you, so it never takes more than  a couple hours to do.\\n\\n2) Yep there\\'s a phone number listed on the Contact Us page. I use Google\\'s free phone number thing that just routes it to my cell phone. So I literally answer customer calls on my cell phone at my desk (again, this is my full-time job so I\\'m not answering it while I\\'m working a different job). I don\\'t have it very prominently displayed on the site because for now I\\'d prefer to handle things over email (I use Zendesk), but occasionally it pays off and eventually it will become more of a factor and I\\'ll have to outsource phone customer service. Yesterday a guy actually placed an order over the phone after viewing it online - heh., Shopify does a great job of fraud detection and prevention, so I primarily rely on that. Between my two stores I have only had one or two fraudulent orders that made it out the door and resulted in a chargeback. \\n\\nSo actually earlier this week a guy placed an order for an $1800 printer that can be found elsewhere for about half that, and it turned out to be fraudulent. He later tried to buy the same printer under a different name. In this case for example, the transaction was attempted 4 times on 4 different cards before it went through, and Shopify flagged it as high-risk. It shows every detail for each payment attempt, and outlines other details (such as purchasing through a proxy) that can be indicative of a fraudulent order. I contacted him and requested a scan/photograph of his ID, which he sent me a fake image of, so I cancelled the order and refunded the card.\\n\\nThey\\'re few and far between, but anytime Shopify notifies me of a high risk order I just follow up and make a determination., I started again literally yesterday, so I\\'m hardly an expert (YET). I\\'m still on my first prosthesis, an Osser Mauch, which for pedaling purposes is essentially the same as anything else in free-swing mode I suppose. Here\\'s my day-one lessons:\\n\\n1. Get a strap or a foot-cage or something to hold your foot on the pedal. I went down to my bike shop and found the cheapest version of [something like this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NUKcyMkBL._SY355_.jpg), and installed it on just the left side (keeps my right foot free for stopping).\\n\\n2. Mounting/dismounting is the hardest part, especially if your a left-side amputee and have a normal kickstand. The shop guy showed me [something like this](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0265/3155/products/IMG_2828_1024x1024.jpg?v=1379307539) in a catalogue and I should be getting it in next week, see if that\\'s better. In general though, getting on and strapping up is awkward -- the \\'female\\' frames, with the swooping body shape, might actually be smarter, since then you can stand normally in front of the seat and handle all the footwork more comfortably, but my ego can\\'t handle that.\\n\\n3. I *think* I\\'m going to need to raise my seat height a little bit, since I\\'m really slamming against the max-flexion angle at the top of my stroke..... Plan on toying with that today, or, knowing me, I\\'ll just keep thumping along and pretend I don\\'t notice. \\n\\n4. I was getting tired super-fast and wound up googling some tips, turns out you lose about 80% of your power on the affected side, so expect a really good workout for not a whole lot of time. \\n\\n5. Socket-wise, I\\'m in suspension-only right now and a little loose until the weekend.... it wiggles on me a tiny bit, but it\\'s not really noticeable until I\\'m done. the socket rotates a little bit as I\\'m going, partly because I\\'m sweating so much in the liner and that thing just loves to run away when it gets damp. It\\'s not really a problem, just something to be aware of so you\\'re not surprised when you finally stop.\\n\\n6. No crashes yet, but the shop guy was pretty concerned about how to ditch when one foot is strapped in. Best answer I\\'ve come up with so far is \"Don\\'t,\" but if you think of anything better, I\\'m all ears. In general be mindful of wiping out, I think that\\'s probably an ordeal. , Thanks for your response. Honestly, because of this post, I\\'m going to look at getting set up with at least one distributor as soon as my LLC paperwork is processed, although I may not use Shopify or go the Google Shopping route.\\n\\nOne thing to augment your point #6 - you can use camelcamelcamel to pull historical prices for specific products on Amazon. It\\'s not Google Shopping but it is another great data resource., Thanks for the response - I did some research and I agree, there\\'s no reason to pay extra to file the LLC, it\\'s so simple.\\n\\nDoes it matter if the LLC has a name similar to the niche or shopify store name? I\\'ve been meaning to set one up for a few things I\\'m working on and I was hoping to use the same one for multiple projects., Practically every website is going to have html and css... An ecommerce site will have a database (SQL based most likely) and a server side language (php,python,node.js, etc). Most ecommerce sites will also use some javascript on the front end.\\n\\nCreating an ecommerce site from scratch is no simple task, even for a seasoned developer. Check out some ecommerce CMSs like woocommerce for wordpress, opencart, shopify, magento, prestashop, the list goes on. 9 times out of 10, these premade systems will do everything you want and more., Thank you for the well wishes! I\\'m very eager to open down there and immensely appreciate all the support the city and the community have given me so far.\\n\\nDo you know a service we can use at the brewery to accept Bitcoin?  We are currently looking in to something simple like Clover or Square for our payment processing in the tasting room.  Neither of them handle bitcoin. \\n\\nAs for paying a kickstarter with bitcoin, quite ironically, there are kickstarters to try and convince kickstarter to accept bitcoin. I found this article online though... http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-payments-kickstarter-shopify-twitter-made-possible-through-stripe-support-1488798\\n\\nNow that I think of it, Amazon accepts Bitcoin, so their square-like equivalent might make it possible..., Im pretty sure this is it... \\nhttp://becautoparts.myshopify.com, Hello,\\n\\nI have been recently looking at plate mounts for plate mounted switches.\\n\\nIs there any difference between the plates that have [Square holes](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0314/6133/products/R8WMZvi_grande.png?v=1400693720) to the ones that have the little [tabs in](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/HysRQnJiupQ/maxresdefault.jpg)., Yea thats what I mean.

Neither in my drawn schematic nor my actual wiring is that push button hooked up from common to NO.

Highly recommended., Here are some pictures of genuine product. The difference is more pronounced on some pairs than others. In fact, my two pairs (one worn, one DS) are slightly different.

If you run your own cart software you\\'re vulnerable to attack every single time a new exploit is discovered unless you patch it instantly, which nobody ever does and nobody ever can. , http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0105/4542/products/fun_grande.jpg?v=1395258404, Thanks! We\\'re definitely very lucky to be in the position that we are. The process is pretty automated. Our store, as well as our customers, all use Shopify as a front end, so the orders go from there, to Shipstation, and then get managed by SkuVault. We\\'re by no means a large volume company though. We\\'re pretty efficient for the volume we have, but we\\'d be absolutely crushed if we had 5,000 orders to get out in a day. That being said, we have no intention of being at that point with our clients. Our goal is to help people get to that level, and then hand them off to someone who specializes in that type of volume.\\n\\nWe offer a lot of flexibility in how the clients are set up though. There are a plethora of sales platforms that would easily integrate with the system we use.\\n\\nAs for pricing, we don\\'t charge rent for storage. We charge a flat rate processing fee just for handling the order itself. Then we charge a pick fee based on \"how big of a pain in the ass it is to pack\", and then shipping. We don\\'t mark up shipping, but we do require that we charge shipping on our card. Our Amex Business card allows us to pick different categories for point multipliers. Since shipping is one of the options, we took the 3x point multiplier on that and it allows us to get essentially 2% back on the shipping costs we charge. So we just bill the client for the exact postage they use and then make our 2% on the cashback. The idea for this came from some discussions about how large retailers handle their Adsense spend. They essentially try to break even on the ROI for their advertising spend, and then get 2% back on the card they charge everything to, increasing their margin by that amount. So they are getting new customers, which is inherently expensive, but still able to squeak out a profit on the transaction. For us though, the real money maker is the processing and packing fees. We also charge a per-conversation customer service fee. We charge for every inquiry that comes in regardless of the length of the conversation. If they\\'re just asking a simple question, it\\'s the flat fee. If it\\'s a long email chain, it\\'s still the same flat fee. It puts the onus on us to be super efficient with how we handle every one of them and keep our labor costs down.\\n\\nThe real hurdles mainly came from having to figure out how to handle large amounts of inventory effectively. It\\'s really easy to lose track of overstock when you\\'re in the thick of holiday season and the likes. A lot of the organization and streamlining came when my wife came on board full time and helped organize everything on a detailed level.\\n\\nCapital investment was a big thing too. We were lucky that the TxHumor.com store was doing so well that it could fund the warehouse buildout pretty easily. The warehouse rent itself is a steal for the part of Austin it\\'s in, so that helps. We also worked with a warehouse equipment liquidator to get shelving. We got enough shelving to store 1,600 normal sized boxes for only $3,600, plywood included. It was crazy cheap., A LOT of Shopify stories on here lately, or maybe it\\'s just me being cynical. Still, I found the post interesting, thanks., Volusion is indeed an outdated shopping cart. Since you have a high number of products, i wouldn\\'t recommend easy to start shopping carts like BigCommerce, shopify, etc as they are very user friendly but not scalable.\\nTo handle high number of products, you need a feature rich platform which is scalable. According to me, your best bet would be Magento. As its *open source, *can customize the way you want, *has lots of features and is *very scalable and the best part is their *community version is FREE.\\nAlso to its much affordable to hire magento developers to get your magento site customize than BigCommerce or Shopify, etc.\\nI am in the process of switching from BigCommerce to Magento for more features and scalability. I got lucky enough to find a good developer who made me a Magento website - nice looking one - in around $700 customized to my needs with mobile ready version and i bought the Hostgator Business plan hosting which is about $12/month you get your private/dedicated ip for your server , unlimited domains you can host, email hosting, and a private/dedicated SSL - (v.important). So all and all i spend about $900 on my website - which is good for 1 year and from next year, i just pay the hosting fees which is $12/month. \\nAnd i am so happy to see all the amazing extensions available for magento - you can really take your business to next level with these extensions., Do you accept bitcoin as a payment method?\\n\\nI don\\'t see it listed alongside the other payment methods at the bottom of your site.\\n\\nBut its a Shopify site, and Shopify makes it **REAL** easy to accept bitcoin.\\n\\nSo?, [Update!](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0159/4298/files/HWG_Newsletter_40_-_salute_2015.pdf?5510651607815006605), Shopify has an API, have you searched online for scripts that do exactly what you described?, Although I agree with you, versusmedia have a project listed under their \"Magento\" tab that turns out to be a Shopify site., We posted this in /r/shutupandtakemymoney last week and a few people mentioned that we should post it here since we proudly accept bitcoin. \\n\\nFYR we run our store on Shopify which offers amazingly easy bitcoin integration with Coinbase. \\n\\n&lt;3 bitcoins, I think there are some exclusions to the sale and Alden might be one of them.

It seems like you have really figures out the ins and outs of drop shipping. You mentioned that you need to form an LLC. What if I already have inventory on hand and do not need a \"distributor account\" and just want to push it through Shopify? Do I still need to set it up? I heard that taxes are more complicated with an LLC and it is only beneficial if your net income is above a certain range. , Love that you are kicking butt in the shipping costs!! \\n\\n I\\'m working on that plugin for my shopify store to aggregate the \"affiliate offers\" other stores like yours have on my sauce... kind of like amazon does \"available at X, Y, Z\"  - that way I can just concentrate on bulk-orders, and get my customers better value by directing to you., http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0713/5179/products/pom-photo_large.jpg?v=1417566147, [Yup.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0044/9802/products/FW13-Journeyman-Product-11_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1416616596), [Positive Quote for Today,] (http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0188/8284/files/quote371_large.jpg?1434), Shopify is crushing it.

We started on eBay and Shopify at about the same time last year. We received our 50th order on eBay about 4 months from launching, and our 50th order on Shopify after about 6 months.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nStarting out we did the following:\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n1. Asked our Facebook friends to like our page and share (early outreach helps a ton!)\\n2. Whenever an order was placed on eBay we included a small note thanking our customer for their purchase and directing them to our website (get as many as you can toward your most profitable channel!)\\n3. Posting every day on Instagram (find a community of your potential customers!)\\n4. Going to Anime Expo (go where your customers are!)\\n\\nInstagram helped us at first, as there are a lot of people interested in Anime (our particular niche) posting up there all the time. We did a lot of liking and following there. Going to Anime Expo here in Los Angeles helped get the word out and gave us a nice stream of visitors to start out with. Other than the passes and $50 worth of fliers, there was no cost and it resulted in our first couple of sales on Shopify.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nOne thing we contribute to our success was our photography. Our pictures are by no means amazing, but most of our competitors used pictures directly from the manufacturer. We found that they in no way did justice to the item (most of the time) so we take the extra time to take and edit our own pictures, even if that means a delay in getting everything up.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nWe aren\\'t the fastest growing store, but we\\'re doing okay. :), Here\\'s what\\'s worked for me so far.  First thing I did was make a small stockpile of candles in every scent.  Then I farmed out a bunch of candles at cost to friends and family to get their feedback.\\n\\nI got a good amount of info back, and I adjusted the recipes accordingly.  Once I was ready, I started up a Shopify account and built a website within a day.  Etsy as well.  Think of Etsy like a mall. It\\'s good, but crowded.  There are lots of other retailers selling similar items.  \\n\\nShopify gives your store it\\'s own URL, so it looks more professional, but it\\'s up to you to promote your page.\\n\\nI contacted a few brick and mortar stores in town, and got one to carry my candles.  Their percentage is steep, but it\\'s getting my name out there.  I\\'m also working on getting a spot in a local farmer\\'s market this year...just waiting to hear back from the organizers.  The market will be my best venue I think, with people looking for handmade, artisanal items.  If your city/town/hamlet/village/borough/metropolis has a store that sells locally made stuff, look into that.  If they\\'re soy candles, try health food stores, wellness stores, and new-age stores.  For the new-agers you might want to concentrate on natural oils, extracts and scents that are rumoured to have healing qualities.\\n\\nOther than that, shamelessly plug your stuff.  Give out some freebies to people who will talk about your products.  Make sure your social media friends know that you\\'re making them.\\n\\nHope that helps!, Thank you!

Also, if it\\'s a 3 speed it\\'s definitely a VNB though a late VNB should be 4 speed. The taillight is the one used on late VNB/VBBs, early Sprints..

I have a background of 20 years in freelance art/sculpting.  I started the company last summer when I couldn\\'t find any phone cases that weren\\'t boring, generic clones with a sticker slapped on them.  I jumped the gun and put out a kickstarter last year before I reached out to any media and fell short of the goal.  Was contacted by a few big name case makers but none of the deals to license were what I was looking for.  So I sold a bunch of stuff and bought the materials and equipment to start making them myself.  We will be launching the first run for iPhone 6/6+ and Galaxy s5/s6 over the next few months.  Other phone/device models coming, and more designs as well.  Currently working on the Shopify store.  \\n\\n**Are you looking for anything?**: Connections to take it to the next level.

In other words, is inventory being deducted from the same place? Shopify can be used as an ecommerce platform, and if your inventory is shared they also have Shopify pos which can be used in place of square.

Other times the Ruby magic can make it very hard to track down bugs for hours.\\n\\n&gt;Python takes a more direct approach to programming.

Especially the animation that re-arranges products as you click through categories \"Top sellers\", \"leathers\", etc. \\nI have a product and I am building a website for it. I used to know how to make a decent website five years ago, but things have changed quite a bit. I was considering using Weebly or Shopify and then learning Wordpress and transferring all content over. How much time did you spend on your website? Do you wish you used a ready-to order template and put your time elsewhere in retrospect? , There are an infinite amount of sandwiches you can make. But, only a subset are edible, and a small amount of those are tasty. You\\'ll notice that as a pattern, most sandwiches have bread, some leafy greens, a meat, a cheese, etc. Subway is a popular sandwich chain which offers a value to sandwich eaters because they have a bunch of common ingredients for most sandwiches all in one place. This allows you to make really fancy and tasty sandwiches without a lot of efforts because *most* sandwiches you make will have these common ingredients. \\n\\nYou *can* ask for extra servings or odd combinations. Or if you\\'re really sure what you\\'re doing, you can reopen your sandwich and add your own ingredients. But Subway is popular because they make assumptions about what kind of ingredients you want and make it super easy to make really good sandwiches really fast with a reasonable degree of customization.\\n\\nA web framework is the Subway of web development. Developers of RoR know that most web applications have certain features and functions, so they package them together and organize them so that most of the code you have to write is custom code for your unique application instead of having to write basic necessary features from scratch. This allows you to make web apps very quickly and easily.\\n\\nJust like bread, meat, cheese, and veggies, web frameworks will have all the packaging to create routing, views, controllers, and models which behave as you would expect. There are built in options to customize your framework (like asking the Subway lady for an extra serving of onion). Or, the whole thing (RoR) is essentially a big Ruby file organized in a certain way, so if your Ruby skills are good enough you can make it do *anything* with a little extra work (taking your sandwich home and adding your own smoky chipotle jam which Subway doesn\\'t have but you know that you like). \\n\\nThe consistent organization and conventions in RoR make it easy for collaborators to jump in to your code and work with you. Just like how you can walk into any Subway in the country and still get that same sandwich or customize a sandwich with the same rules as your home Subway.\\n\\nFor your server questions:\\n\\nAnother feature (sandwich ingredient) is a built in web server (webrick) which allows you to see what the code you\\'re working on live. But webrick is very light and simple, not generally meant for production use. Typically, to get your app online there are a number of spiffy services which specialize in running powerful servers meant for web applications, things like Heroku and Digital Ocean. Read about those services, as they are really helpful for getting your first web apps deployed.\\n\\nMany frameworks exist, but Ruby on Rails is particularly popular because of how easy/readable Ruby is and how large and helpful the community and documentation around RoR is. There are many popular Ruby on Rails web applications running such as Hulu, Github, Crunchbase, Shopify, Twitter (originally, but has moved to a different backend), Groupon, AirBnB, and Soundcloud for instance.\\n\\nEdit: \"on\" ---&gt; \"of\", As I look, this isn\\'t even a real indiegogo campaign.  You\\'re just using their website as a storefront.  \\n\\nJust set up a real storefront.  It is a couple of clicks at shopify., I\\'m not necessarily disagreeing with you, but I think it\\'s important to recognize that very few web apps will ever reach the kind of scaling problems that _Twitter_ has to deal with. There are some quite large websites powered by Ruby on Rails, including Shopify, AirBnB, GitHub, and Kickstarter, to name some mainstream examples., To state the obvious: if you were running your business on Shopify you would not be having this conversation. They have evolved from a pure eCom platform, to more of an Omnichannel solution that includes a POS. One platform, for your entire retail business.\\n\\nIf you are investing in moving your business from Volusion, you should pick a new platform that supports your entire business, not just the eCom channel. , [This](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0240/6253/products/4499_52_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1371069692), [\"Code delivered and redeemable later in 2015\"](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0417/0233/files/unlock_60b03c35-eec7-4594-96aa-b2e624fd457a.png?2466948531322445753)\\n\\n- [Official page for men Ts order](http://bungiestore.com/collections/featured-nepal-aid-t-shirts/products/nepal-aid-t-shirt-men), I would suggest opening an etsy store, if not, creating a website and using a service like shopify.

I agree that Melee has a high learning curve but it is by no means too hard.  If anything, it is easier to learn now, with all the stuff out in the open and videos online and information available than it ever was before.\\n\\nSo like, back in the day, the overall skill was lower, but it was harder to figure out how techniques worked and how to do them.  Now, the skill ceiling is way higher, but it\\'s also easier to get up to that level as there are better ways to learn and efficiently practice and stuff.  It\\'s a trade-off.\\n\\n\\nAs for their drama or whatever, I haven\\'t followed it much, but it\\'s a young community and Melee was much the same (and I think every competitive gaming community starts out like that).  People who have never been in competitive scenes before are just naive and don\\'t know how certain things work.  For example metagames change even with no patches, Brood War and Melee are GREAT examples for that.  It takes time to fully flesh things out, patches every month are not only unnecessary but actually detrimental to the growth of the game.  But new players don\\'t know that, so they just scream nerf without realizing that the solution is actually just to play better.\\n\\nI love this shirt design: http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0057/9482/products/140822_tee_adaptwhite02_large.jpg?v=1408739831, Hello,\\n\\nYou do not have to pay for the shipping,  the customer will handle that fee every time you sell a record unless you wish to have the units shipped to you directly in this case you can remove $2 per unit from the pricing below. \\n\\nBelow is a list of the minimum retail price (including PayPal/Shopify fees) depending on the number of pre-orders:\\n\\n7\" (10-19)- Blank sleeve: $17.50 / Printed sleeve: $32\\n7\" (20-29) - Blank sleeve: $15 / Printed sleeve: $27.75\\n7\" (30+) - Blank sleeve: $14 / Printed sleeve: $24.75\\n\\n10\" (10-19) - Blank sleeve: $23 / Printed sleeve: $38\\n10\" (20-29) - Blank sleeve: $20 / Printed sleeve: $31.25\\n10\" (30+) - Blank sleeve: $18.50 / Printed sleeve: $27.50\\n\\n12\" (Single) (10-19) - Blank sleeve: $26.50 / Printed sleeve: $41\\n12\" (Single) (20-29) - Blank sleeve: $22.50 / Printed sleeve: $32.75\\n12\" (Single) (30+) - Blank sleeve: $20 / Printed sleeve: $29.25\\n\\n12\" (EP) (10-19) - Blank sleeve: $30.50 / Printed sleeve: $44.75\\n12\" (EP) (20-29) - Blank sleeve: $24.75 / Printed sleeve: $37.25\\n12\" (EP) (30+) - Blank sleeve: $23 / Printed sleeve: $34\\n\\n12\" (Album) (10-19) - Blank sleeve: $32.50 / Printed sleeve: $46\\n12\" (Album) (20-29) - Blank sleeve: $26.25 / Printed sleeve: $39\\n12\" (Album) (30+) - Blank sleeve: $24.50 / Printed sleeve: $35.50\\n\\nWe do understand that our pricing is a bit above the average but we are working really hard to try to lower that as soon as possible and move the entire operation to Miami, FL.

I\\'m not going to go into detail how, but it essentially allows the person to purchase before the release, or at least allow the person to have an instant link to checkout while everyone else is clicking for their size and all that, That\\'s why we switched to Shopify for hosting.

All one has to do is balance a character being used to the boss you have to fight. The boss is easy to program because it follows whatever it is set to do. It does things randomly. Yomi as well as other duel games are very tricky to balance. Yomi the base game has 10 characters, which means you have 90 different match ups to balance. It\\'s so much harder because players will play characters to the best of their ability rather than play cards randomly like a boss from Sentinels would. So I would assume balance effort to be a factor in the cost.\\n\\nSecondly, once again the artwork. It\\'s easier to make games with artwork like this:\\n\\nhttp://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1110427_md.jpg\\n\\nthan artwork like this:\\n\\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0043/0802/files/0048_grave_ah.jpg?9133\\n\\nOne uses more colors, lines, proportions, therefore that artist will probably command a higher price. On top of that, each character in Yomi comes with 56 cards made on quality stock which is more than a character in Sentinels.\\n\\nBattleCON as said before uses Deviant artwork made by random artists that have an inconsistent style and is objectively inferior to the quality of Yomi. That and each character only has 8 unique cards as the base cards are shared. Finally, the artwork for each character\\'s cards are the same. 8 cards per character in BattleCON is not comparable to 56 high-quality cards per character in Yomi. A Yomi character has a heavier weight than a BattleCON one.\\n\\nLCGs do have a lot of value in their core set, but then have a huge amount of packs that cost $10 or more. I\\'ll let you figure out why a GoT core set would cost less than a Yomi COMPLETE set.\\n\\nMage Wars comes with 4 characters for $40. Yomi has 10 characters for $100. I\\'m sure you know how to do fractions. Oh and the MSRP for Mage Wars is actually $59.99. And do I really have to bring up the 4-pack of Yomi that costs $40 as well?\\n\\nSummoner Wars. Once again, we fail to use the magic word \"context\" and we just say whatever is on the top of our head. Each faction deck is only made up of 35 cards, not to mention that the artwork is both smaller and lower in quality. You also fail to use the correct price which is $59.99 MSRP. Sirlin cannot compete with sale prices because his company operates at a smaller scale than Plaid Hat.\\n\\nAgain, what I\\'m seeing from these arguments is the failure to use context and the concept of fractions. If I sell a package that has 2 characters and costs $20 as well as a package that has 10 characters that costs $100, is the 2nd package all of a sudden a waste of money? The 2nd package costs more BUT IT\\'S SUPPOSED TO; you get more content. So saying the 2nd option costs more is a problem just sounds ludicrous., Isn\\'t there shared SSL on Shopify\\'s checkout? , I think they have only been readily available to the public for a few days. I got in on a pre-order at [advanced vapors](http://advanced-vapors.myshopify.com/collections/authentic-high-end-mods/products/authentic-hammer-of-god-box-mod-by-vaperz-cloud) and mine arrived on Saturday. Looks like they now have them in stock and ready to ship. I think they are selling them for a few bucks cheaper than ordering from the manufacturer. I absolutely love mine. It is just the right amount of ridiculous in a reasonably small package. Best of luck in your search for one! , &gt;With my M50X\\'s, the bass is just too low for me\\n\\nThe M50X\\'s are typically regarded as being extremely bass heavy, [take a look at this frequency response graph.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0362/2465/files/audio_technica_athm50x_frequency_response.png)\\n\\nThe bass is very emphasised and treble very recessed. You say you\\'ve turned on \"loudness\" and \"bass boost\" and it\\'s still not bass-heavy enough, I don\\'t know what to tell you. You might want to forgo headphones completely and just strap a pair of subwoofers to the sides of your head.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, extraordinarily heavy bass is not a desirable feature in a high fidelity headphone. Ideally you\\'d want all frequencies playing at roughly the same level. Chances are you are just accustomed to ludicrously loud bass from your Logitech\\'s and you think the M50X are lacking when in reality they are actually very bass heavy. The Logitech\\'s are almost certainly god awful in terms of sound quality and they are probably very bass heavy because they\\'re geared towards the gamer crowd who typically want nothing except big loud explosions in Call of Duty.\\n\\nIncidentally, Windows sound tweaks make everything worse. I would disable them if I were you, but they\\'re your ears not mine!, We just did a dev release on our Shopify/Drupal integration module. Review/feedback always appreciated. :)\\n\\nhttps://www.drupal.org/project/shopify, Intriguing website! I have to look into shopify more. I see it everywhere lately and the websites usually look pretty nice., Typically, you\\'d setup a site with secure SSL (https) for taking payments and integrate a merchant account. It can be complicated, but there are a lot of packaged systems that make the process easier. Like Weebly eCommerce, Shopify, or Volusion. I did a comparison of two of those here with videos of each: http://webeminence.com/shopify-vs-weebly-ecommerce/\\n, Sales tax needs to be collected based on the state you are shipping from and shipping to. It needs to be paid to the State on a quarterly basis. I\\'ve never used Shopify so I don\\'t know if they have something like this already in place to let you know what you need to collect and pay. \\n\\nIncome tax is different. This is the tax you pay the Feds, state and local tax collectors on the profits of the business after expenses are taken out. You should set aside about 1/3 of your net profit for taxes and taxes need to filed quarterly with the Feds, State, and locals. Talk to your accountant about setting up estimated quarterly taxes. , I don\\'t know that I can, but might be able to if you give me everything you have in one message. The main reason I was unable to help, is that I did not have a detailed message explaining your needs. \\n\\nWith web development, the part that makes it expensive is the time it takes to nail down all the needs of the client (back and forth emails, helpdesk, changes to tiny things they change after seeing it, etc). That isn\\'t a bad thing, as communicating technical needs can be very difficult. So I ranked the PMs in order of most detailed to least detailed, and went from there. \\n\\nIf you would like, then type up everything you can about your business model, goals, needs, aim, timeframe, location, etc, and then message me. \\n\\n**If you want a quick landing page:**\\n\\n**Free:** \\n\\nWix, Weebly\\n\\n**Paid/Simple:**\\n\\nSquarespace, Weebly, Wix\\n\\n**Paid/Landing Page with metrics:**\\n\\nInstapage, Unbounce, Leadpages\\n\\n**Paid - Ready-made eCommerce solution:**\\n\\nShopify\\n\\n**Paid/Simple w/ room for expanded functionality:**\\n\\nWordpress Drag-n-Drop theme on shared hosting\\n\\n\\n**Paid - Custom site planned specifically with your product, demographic, workflow, logistics, pageviews, etc in mind**\\n\\nHire a web developer/consultant to guide you through the seemingly infinite number of options. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n, [Comme sur un bidet](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0408/8497/files/straddle-bidet.png) , [picture for clarification](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0209/3222/products/pomade1_grande.jpg?v=1430533203), Not OP, but [I like the look of it.](http://justvapeinc.myshopify.com/products/the-vector-rda-by-vls-vapourlifestyle) , Realistically, you won\\'t be able to but the general idea is you would perform SEO (search engine optimization) on your image.\\n\\nThere are many variables that finally contribute to what image shows up first (and some of those variables are dependant on each user). Here are some overviews of what you would need to do:\\n\\nhttp://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/us/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf\\n\\nhttp://searchenginewatch.com/sew/opinion/2120682/ranking-image-search\\n\\nhttp://www.tagseoblog.com/optimizing-images-for-google-imagesearch-image-seo-basics\\n\\nhttp://www.shopify.com/blog/7412852-10-must-know-image-optimization-tips, http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0066/2852/products/smbc-dangerous_large.png?v=1310617065, [Dondi](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0163/6540/products/dondi_volume02.jpg?760), It didn\\'t go down because its Shopify., Great video, but I don\\'t understand your point.  The Manhattan mod is vented.\\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0253/3619/products/abe580346586e30950fdb6932b893387_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1408763093\\n\\nIt has predrilled vent holes for air to escape from into the switch mechanism.  It isn\\'t escaping due to poor tolerances.  They drilled holes to vent into the area of the switch where air can escape.\\n\\nHowever, I am now fully convinced that blowing air into a mod cannot inform you whether or not it\\'ll vent., Speak for yourself. I use [fancy leggings] (https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0475/2353/products/Screen_Shot_2014-06-05_at_9.49.08_PM_1024x1024.png?v=1402030019) to distract from my sub - lmao1pl8 squat., forget all the other advice here, and listen up. use shopify and the faceted search plugin., * Have a single page listing your juice flavors so I don\\'t have to look AT EVERY FUCKING PAGE just to see what a flavor is.\\n* If you use shopify, make the product description section open by default. Two clicks to see a flavor sucks.\\n\\nJust my $0.02USD, I work as self employed in e-commerce and there\\'s a horrible side effect to this. Slowly but surely, all my favorite sales channels are dumbing down like mad.\\n\\nEverything suddenly seems to be catering to someone with a double digit IQ and fat fingers on a tiny smart phone. Your sales lists, instead of being a concise list of addresses and item numbers, are now half a page per single sale, with a giant photo (in case you didn\\'t know what the item looked like). \\n\\nAddress formatting is becoming difficult to either copy/paste or export because the formatting is for a smart phone screen, not a label printer. Extremely important information, such as time/date of sale, customer full name/address, is omitted to make room for the giant item title (and pictures of it) and a \\'SEND IT NOW\\' reminder. \\n\\nAmazon, Ebay, and Shopify are my primary channels and all 3 just get worse with each update, with ebay being the worst offender. Oh, and paypal\\'s new beta look is a god damn nightmare in the same sense. Oh you have 500 transactions this week? Let\\'s skip the overview and just give each one it\\'s own full page of just buyer name and amount, just in case you can\\'t see those pieces of information, which are obviously the only thing you\\'ll ever need to know.\\n\\nI spend half my life scrolling and clicking endless links just to get the most basic of information. \\n\\nI am dead convinced the younger generation is indeed getting too stupid to understand something like a concise list, and it instead requires very large photographs and headline text to even begin to comprehend that they\\'ve sold something on ebay.\\n\\n, http://rideit.myshopify.com/, [Imgur mirror!](http://imgur.com/t9fzMDA) Also, in case you don\\'t know the poster this is referencing, [here it is,](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0228/9021/products/RWBY_volume_2.jpg?v=1396378438) the obvious difference is that Ruby\\'s teammates are reflected in Crescent Rose\\'s blade, not her enemies., I finally got a physical copy of Morning Teleportation\\'s *Expanding Anyway*, from Glacial Pace records and produced by Isaac Brock. It\\'s great to be able to read the liner notes and view the vividly beautiful artwork. The credits don\\'t mention who exactly plays what in what song (there are a lot of instruments and the music is really dense), but it does credit Isaac Brock as a backing vocalist in three or four songs. [Here](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/5432/products/ExpAnyCDcomplete_1024x1024.jpg?v=1297975998) is a link to what the CD looks like. One day when I finally have a vinyl set up I want to get the LP as well, as the artwork looks even [more gorgeous](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/5432/products/Expanding_AnywayLPFoldout_1024x1024.jpg?v=1299521258) blown up. \\n\\nI keep plugging these guys in the slack, if you have the time you really should check this album out. I have heard it described as Modest Mouse on a lot more acid. I like to think of it as Modest Mouse meets Animal Collective and sings the blues. For fans of King Gizzard, Modest Mouse, and Tame Impala, or people who love top notch instrumentation.\\n\\nAlso tomorrow I am finally going to buy *Quarters!* by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. I\\'ve played it so many times on their website that it won\\'t let me listen for free anymore., Looks like a good plugin. However I don\\'t plan on selling products direct-to-customer, and I plan on expanding the functionality of my website beyond the \"product browser\", so I don\\'t think Shopify is a good match. Thanks for the suggestion though!, I don\\'t think there\\'s a strong enough connection between the man in this photo and the art on the wall. The photo also appears to be posed (and before anyone replies to me I can\\'t be fucked getting into another debate about the definition of street photography). Take a look at the photo on the [right side page](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0543/2189/products/PAT-Dream-Life-Cover2-PB-1114-03_1024x1024.jpg?v=1430860943) as an example of how it can be done better., It\\'s a quickly growing community and business venture that doesn\\'t require a ton of effort or capital to get started. Anyone can make a basic shopify or similar website, come up with a name, make some listings for hardware items that anyone anywhere can buy, and make a couple bucks profit. Juice DIY is super easy so anyone can also make and sell juices for profit. The only obstacle is marketing and advertising., That\\'s the goal! A lot of the sites I found were poorly designed and some were very clean and simple, it was amazing how big of a difference it made. I would almost instantly exit out of the convoluted messes, so I have a pretty good idea how I am going to design the website and have some knowledge in CSS, HTML, and JS but will most likely start with a template from shopify and alter it for simplicity and e-commerce. , When you reply, next to cancel it says \"reddiquette\" and \"formatting help\".

FYI2 you can use shopify as a pretty full featured CMS - make custom templates to suppress price/checkout/cart.\\n\\nfor what you are doing, and based on \"very limited experience\" believe me when i say starting with the simplest, most basic thing will make a huge difference. the number of people in your position who tried a joomla, wordpress, or magento and are now stuck are as numerous and tortured as the souls in hell., If you want flashy polarized sunglasses for cheap i have [these] (http://sunski.myshopify.com/collections/originals) in blue and my friends can\\'t stop stealing them off my face.

That\\'s enough, there\\'s not really anything I can do about fixing it, as it\\'s through shopify. I was mostly just curious :P, These [Adidas](http://oneness287-2.myshopify.com/collections/all/products/adidas-sl-loop-ct-2), it\\'s probably going to be a little bit before the next sale as being closed for so long, merchant/shopify fees, utilities, rent and recent investments (bottles, labels, stickers, furniture, computer, etc) have put the company in a temporary tight spot and I now need to pay 2 employees as well (I\\'m starting them out at a very fair wage). So I need to get the company back to having some decent money in the bank account compared to what it has now. Trust me, I make up for not having discounts :P, Then to be honest Shopify + Shopify POS sounds like your best bet. That is pretty much the optimal use case for it right now. \\n\\nShopify POS is included with every Shopify plan, so you can get both the POS + ecom for the price of a Shopify ecommerce plan. There is a retail add on that is $40 per month which will give you a few extra features, but depending on your needs you might not need it. You can have unlimited locations with the one monthly plan, no per location costs.\\n\\nShopify POS with or without the retail pack will give you shared inventory with your ecommerce store. Inventory from all 6 events would deduct from the same place as your ecommerce store, you would have reports that you would show you sales for each event separately or together as well as ecom (you can set up locations for each event and assign your iPads to each location).\\n\\nThe $40 retail pack I mentioned will give you access to staff accounts so you can have register shifts by staff member (in your case by team member). The retail pack also allows you to use certain hardware (barcode scanner, receipt printer, electronic cash drawer) otherwise you would have to manually add products to cart/email receipts/manually open drawer. , [apparel you say?!](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0228/8535/products/AOPTS0159U_Nicolas_Cage_Rage_Faces_Mockup_1024x1024.jpg?v=1426550084), I bought a [Seagull Maritime SWS](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0332/7621/products/2__65855_6315ad1a-fc1c-4510-9ff2-5e127751a585.jpeg?v=1401226210) and I love that finish. I\\'m hoping to get a Performer soon too., What is your waist size like and how large are your thighs? \\n\\n[Swrve](http://swrve.myshopify.com/) has some pretty decent selection for warm weather shorts and most of them go up to size 38.\\n\\nI\\'m a huge fan of Outlier shorts and they currently have some in size 38. ([New Way](http://shop.outlier.cc/shop/retail/new-way-shorts.html), [New Way Long](http://shop.outlier.cc/shop/retail/new-way-longs.html))\\n\\nI have to agree with /u/AlmdudlerBoy69\\'s advice though. I\\'m 6\\' and used to be 240lbs (wearing mostly size 38-40 for most pants) and most shorts don\\'t look that good on me. \\n\\nDropped down to 170lbs (size 30-32) and it\\'s easier to look for clothing that fits and most would look good without trying too hard these days., Very indifferent to his own birthdays, not interested in attention from cakes/parties etc but LOVES presents without expecting them, as long as they are actually things he really wants. I\\'ve been told I\\'m particularly good at picking presents so it seems to work well. For example, last birthday I got him drum lessons and sticks and he\\'s been wanting to learn his entire life. Very rewarding seeing him smile, and he got quite emotional about it a couple of months later (sometimes takes him a while to process feels) because of how much it meant to him, which he hadn\\'t really expressed so much at the time.\\n\\nHe\\'s good at picking presents, and good at listening to things I say. His presents are extremely relevant to my interests. My last birthday he bought me a tablet so I could do digital art. He\\'s also given me an ereader (I love reading). He bought and got framed for me an enormous print last year by one of his favourite digital artists of one of my [favourite things](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0186/7976/products/Rabbit-of-Inlie_b7214d28-1560-4a67-8f9d-7cfe2d0492ea_1024x1024.jpg?v=1417227439?1430897820297), which the artist signed and drew on the back of. His presents definitely seem to be more along gadgets/digital things rather than jewelry/flowers but that\\'s OK with me., It\\'s there on the checkout?\\n\\nMany ecommerce stores don\\'t have store wide SSL anyway as it can cause slow load times.\\n\\nAlso, you have no control with SSL on Shopify. You are forced to use their shared one unless you\\'re on Shopify Plus. , When the site is up check out the SARD009. I have not seen one in person yet but images are just stunning.

I think it is around $900 and it is fairly new so you are not going to see it on some one else\\'s wrist., Considering your passion for cars I would say do something car related. Go to the pick and pull and find parts that could be sold online. Setup a shopify account and throw pictures of the parts you found online. Get the rare bits that people want but don\\'t have access to. The hard part of this will be knowing what will sell and building a following that knows your store exists. Setup google shopping and spend $10 a week on ads. All in you are looking at $520 for ads, $300 for shopify. Stick to it for a year and you will learn more about business than you can imagine. Don\\'t get discouraged. Find buyers and tell them about your store. Post pictures of your inventory on Instagram. If you want to know more pm me. , Yeah man no problem :D.

Could be viable for simple e-commerce stores or perhaps used to leverage existing shopify integrations. , Yea, someone with an existing Shopify store that wants to display their store within their Drupal site can very easily do so.

So beware. , I handled the entire migration to Bigcommerce, implementation of our ERP, and shipping/logistic services myself.\\n\\nWhile Bigcommerce offers/offered the \\'white glove\\' service to move all of your data over, I found that they were taking a machete to a job that required a scalpel and decided to forgo their \\'expert\\' service and do everything properly and efficiently from the get-go. \\n\\nI\\'ve come to the realization that there is a desperate need for this type of service - someone to meticulously handle a website migration as it relates to data - that I\\'ve started helping a few colleagues move their sites to newer platforms like Bigcommerce and Shopify. It\\'s not a full-fledged company, per se, but if you\\'re interested in speaking further feel free to PM me!\\n\\nBest of luck :), Yeah - I\\'m kind of furious that the redirect isn\\'t up right now and my web guy is asleep.

Clean lines, good color palette. Does she make other prints of other animals? Any other media she creates content on? Yes as others suggest etsy would be the best place for her to start her business, but I think it\\'s a great as a dry run to start a business. It\\'s a self-intuitive interface and the company helps you set up everything to create an online store without the hassle. If there is a large market on etsy interested in her product, shopify/squarespace would be the way to go to create a place that is their own.

If you want it switched back after you get it transferred just let me know.\\n\\nAwesome sale!  Good luck!, [SWRVE](http://swrve.myshopify.com/collections/pants/) offers a few options that are a little bit cheaper. I don\\'t have any experience with them though. , It is definitely not expensive, but it\\'s worth choosing options that are not at the bottom to avoid lots of headaches ... and to make sure you don\\'t outgrow your setup weeks after opening! \\n\\nA hosted option like Shopify is often the best overall even though it\\'s not the cheapest upfront, because it saves you so so many problems and gives you a shop that\\'s better than one you would build yourself. If Shopify has all the features you need, I highly recommend it! I wish I could use it for my site, but they don\\'t support selling in decimal quantities... I went with WooCommerce and host it on AWS with cloudfront as the CDN, and i\\'m paying about $60/month for hosting with this setup, if that helps., I am going to plug Dan Craft on this one. I have built on 4 of his blanks, and for the price, you cannot get any better.\\n\\nhttp://dan-craft-enterprises.myshopify.com/\\n\\nI have mostly used the Five Rivers blanks, which is more of a moderate action, supple presentation rod. However, I have also heard good things about his faster blanks too. Check it out., Exactly. This port of LHM to PHP has the exact same limitations as https://github.com/soundcloud/lhm in regard to remapping data.\\n\\nWhat might be easier in this case is to add the new columns then have a script remap the data once the table has been migrated.\\n\\nYou would end up with a table like this:\\n\\n    id integer PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT\\n    json_data TEXT,\\n    some_integer INTEGER,\\n    some_string VARCHAR(255),\\n    etc.\\n\\nThen run your data mapping script to move json_data into some_integer and some_string.\\n\\n\\nEDIT\\n\\nLHM was built by SoundCloud and is used by Shopify + many others. In high load production systems with multiple servers accessing the database dropping a column + mapping to new fields isn\\'t really doable due to the distributed nature of the system. While your API / web front end / back end are being updated to the new version of your software dropping a column would have disastrous effect until all systems are synchronized., If you\\'re already using Shopify for your web orders, seems reasonable to at least try out their POS before looking for alternatives that may or may not integrate with your website that well. Have you already checked it out? Was it missing features that you need?\\n\\nAt an old job we used Quickbooks POS and I liked it just fine back then (this was 10 years ago). I have no idea how the current version works. And I don\\'t think you can sync QB to Shopify, so you\\'ll still have to do some manual adjustments if you go this route.\\n\\nI\\'m deep in the finding-a-pos journey myself, and my current top choice is Erply. I\\'m an unusual customer though because I\\'m a programmer, so the things I care about are not the same things normal people care about when picking a POS... for example, I wanted something with an API I could use when writing my own software., I started making [these things](http://www.edgedomes.com/collections/domes/products/2-hammock-mini-dome) just for Hammock-Camping at Bonnaroo\\n\\n[Picture](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0673/7711/products/IMG_20150320_142823_1024x1024.jpg?v=1427221235), \\nYou need:\\n\\n* one random jackass with a phantom\\n\\n*  a [wifi pineapple](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple) (100 $)\\n\\n* some velcro\\n\\nHere is a [talk at DEFCON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ5jILY1vlw) about a guy doing basically the same with his pets., [here](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0491/9773/products/Novesta-01-02.jpg?v=1429637481) you go and their [sole](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0491/9773/products/Novesta-01-04.jpg?v=1429637481) is pretty interesting also, A locking nut can put the strings very slightly out of tune when clamped, this is why Floyd\\'s have fine tuners.

I got them all at [Inked and Screened](http://inked-and-screened.myshopify.com/), theough they had a special on massdrop so I got them for like 15 rather than 40/ea., I love living in places where the weather will walk right up to you and slap you in the face.\\n\\nI\\'m in coastal Alaska now, and we have everything from earthquakes to winter storms that will dump six feet of snow in two days.\\n\\n[I live in Juneau, and it\\'s a hell of a place](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0110/4582/products/pano_-_juneau_aerial_8k.jpg?v=1322633024)\\n\\nthe city is strung along the coast for about thirty miles, never going inland more than three or four miles, because of the mountains.  behind the mountains is [the Juneau Ice Field](https://sarahwcooley.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/cdsc00470.jpg).  It\\'s 1500 square miles of constant ice and glaciers, with over 140 glaciers in the system.  \\n\\nwhen the conditions are right, we get what is called Taku Winds.  Cold air up on the icefield gets pulled down to sea level through a siphon action, and it results in winds of 100+mph that can last for a week or two in winter.  constant winds over 50mph.   The radio station where I do my radio show had a satellite dish rated for 135mph winds that ended up in the parking lot a few years ago.  I have watched unmanned weather stations online hit 140 or 150 mph winds up on the ridges., I\\'ve done *exactly* what you say, with board/felt. Works fine, cheap, easy to do, just takes a bit of time. I\\'ve gotten pen trays before, and if she still stocks them (she was considering shuttering her pen biz), you can find some [here from Pendora](http://pendora-pens.myshopify.com/collections/pen-tray-liner-inserts). The other source that I\\'m aware of, though I haven\\'t purchased, are trays from [Gary Lehrer of gopens.com](http://www.gopens.com/Vintage_Pen_Parts/vintage_pens_12X16Trays.php)., I\\'m relatively new to ecommerce, but Shopify has really lowered the barrier to entry. In addition it is very easy to setup and manage. Sure, you get locked in to a framework, but if you find the right dev to write custom templates then you are set. It\\'s peace of mind not having to manage payments and system administration.\\n\\nAlternatively, have you looked into Django? There is an [ecomm package](https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/ecommerce/) for it. This is just based on personal opinion, as Python is my go to language, and I\\'m skeptical of WP and all of it\\'s holes (-_-) *I\\'m probably naive*, I am a developer that specializes in ecommerce. How many sku\\'s do you current utilize? Woocommerce can be great, for smaller scale stores but if your sku count is above 50, and you have multiple variations personally I\\'d advise you to consider other platforms.\\n\\nIf can survive on WooCommerce, my next advice would be find a development group that specializes in ecommerce based development, not wordpress development but ecommerce development. Don\\'t get me wrong there\\'s tons of great wordpress developers, but most don\\'t know the first thing about ecommerce, and if they do its typically managing smaller stores and don\\'t know the ins and outs of optimization and lack the deeper knowledge from the ecommerce side.\\n\\nOdds are you\\'ll get a bunch of different quotes, some will say $1,000 and others will say $10,000 +. A lot of that depends on who is doing the data migrations, who is configuring each product, Is there custom app plugin development required etc. and of course over all experience level. Personally I\\'d avoid most of those offers under $3,000, right off the bat, (of course check their work before nixing it, you never know). \\n\\nConversion optimizations, there\\'s the basics which any ecommerce development firm should know and follow. There\\'s a great list of the 50 top moves based off a major research study, if I can find it I\\'ll post it. Outside of that a large bulk of the conversion optimization process is trial and error, the catch is you need enough traffic to do a truly valid test and 90% of stores don\\'t.\\n\\nIf there\\'s any need for third-party development I\\'d avoid BigCommerce and Shopify. It\\'ll cost you an arm and a leg not to mention possibly the developers sanity. , Good luck with your new site!

Just recently had to move a client\\'s e-commerce store outta there and it was so frustrating!\\n\\nIf I were you, I would just go for Shopify. It ticks off everything on your list: supports large quantities of products, free [Digital Downloads App](https://apps.shopify.com/digital-downloads) which is what you would install to add that functionality, lots of solid themes out there that are responsive (mobile-friendly) and built well, customer accounts are a built-in feature.\\n\\nOther options:\\n\\n* [Tictail](https://tictail.com/) - \"Free\" but the apps aren\\'t. Looks very clean/professional though\\n* [Big Cartel](https://www.bigcartel.com/) - Cheaper than Shopify, though may be a bit limited\\n* [Spree Commerce](https://spreecommerce.com/) - Only just heard about this so don\\'t know much, but it powers the Chipotle website and Rick Owens\\' so might be worth it to try the demo at least\\n\\nHope that helps!, Thank you for the response!

Now don\\'t worry its not your standard cheap bracelet you can source on Abilala, It will actually have a purpose and a job to do. No electronics at this point, just a great concept and literally no market for it at the moment yet the theory behind it is proven. Really struggling to find a manufacturer in the US/UK though for the prototyping and initial volumes i\\'m planning on needing.\\n\\nI already have a Shopify store which is inactive right now as i started then gave up on a previous T-shirt E-commerce site as it just wasn\\'t anything i have confidence nor believe in.

So that\\'s ready to go and i have had a few other trials in which i have used to experiment with gaining a following on Twitter etc. \\n\\nLong term plan is to bring in other products which will serve the same purposes and reflect a similar theme to the bracelet idea i have., Hi it seems you are looking for a job in following categories : [#Design](http://wanna.work/t/Design) [#Logo](http://wanna.work/t/Logo) \\n\\nPerhaps you would be interested in following job offers : \\n\\n[[Hiring] (Online) Branding for a new school business management company - logo, business card, website](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/353nin/hiring_online_branding_for_a_new_school_business/) #Design #Logo \\n\\n[[Hiring] (Online) Freelance Graphic Design Work](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/352e4a/hiring_online_freelance_graphic_design_work/) #Design \\n\\n[[Hiring] 3D Graphic Designer/Illustrator](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/352ep3/hiring_3d_graphic_designerillustrator/) #Design \\n\\n[[Hiring] - Graphic Designer to design two web products including Logo\\'s, branding, UI, UX!](http://www.reddit.com/r/NYCjobs/comments/352lcc/hiring_graphic_designer_to_design_two_web/) #Design \\n\\n[[Hiring] (Online) Shopify expert for Design, Inventory, Apps, Schema development.](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/352lvt/hiring_online_shopify_expert_for_design_inventory/) #Design \\n\\n[[Hiring] looking for a graphic designer that can do good air brush graphics](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/353mb4/hiring_looking_for_a_graphic_designer_that_can_do/) #Design \\n\\n[[Hiring] (US) Wordpress design expert.

Would love to chat a bit., I\\'m partial to ActiveCampaign because it has a pretty deep integration into Shopify using an app and can pull images and descriptions directly inside the email builder\\n\\nOne thing that Mailchimp does have an advantage in is with its ecommerce360 integration.\\n, I specialize in LV.  The design looks right (absent the fraying), but the best way to verify it is too look for a manufacturer/serial number inside.  It is likely behind the card holder, upside down, near one of the seams.  Find it and take a picture of it.  \\n\\nIt will look like this: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0100/8372/files/Authenticate_Louis_Vuitton_-_Date_Codes_-_Serial_Numbers_-_President.png?19919\\n\\nIf it doesn\\'t have one, or the font is wrong, it\\'s a fake.  This is the easiest way for me to tell when I source these.  , You probably need to give more requirements than this to get a good answer, but many small projects might be best served by using shopify or volusion or a similar service.\\n\\nIf you want to keep the \"easy\" in your requirements, be prepared to pay a higher transaction fee, have a simple product catalog, and keep the complexity of shipping options, coupons, and etc to a minimum.\\n\\nIf you want to handle more of the details yourself, at the expense of having to do more work, then maybe look into magento and drupal commerce.  I would check out both of those projects as part of general background education, even if you don\\'t intend to use either for this project.  You might also look into the options available to WordPress sites., 5ML samples aren\\'t enough for me. I want at least 10-15.\\n\\nI don\\'t buy from any vendor that doesn\\'t at least offer 60ML bottles. I don\\'t have the space in my house for dozens of 15 and 30 bottles, 120ML are preferred. My vape desk is already full.\\n\\nAre you actually putting rubies in the juice? Please don\\'t do that.\\n\\nA 1.5 MG option would be nice. \\n\\nWhat is the ratio of your max VG juices? All you list is 50/50 and Max VG. It could be anywhere from 60/40 to 90/10 vg/pg. \\n\\nIf you\\'re a new vendor, you should probably have a give away and discounts for your launch, at least something (15 isn\\'t bad but your price are already crazy high - so it\\'s no beuno). That\\'s generally how it goes on this sub since I\\'ve been here this year.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to justify spending a reasonable amount without knowing it.\\n\\nThere are multiple vendors I have purchased sample packs from then quickly turned around and dropped hundreds on.\\n\\nYour website doesn\\'t look ready, it\\'s a bit discombobulated. I wouldn\\'t feel comfortable. Your checkout does not look secure, I get security warnings.\\n\\nYou should probably check out shopify. Most of the other vendors I purchase from use it, it\\'s secure.\\n\\nIf your flavors are great you\\'ll be fine, but you can\\'t come out of the gate and expect to get 20$ a 30ml bottle from people who know the prices around.\\n\\nI don\\'t see anything about free shipping over X amount also, which is standard.\\n\\nGood luck.\\n\\n\\n\\n, I understand. I looked in to BC a few months back and wasn\\'t satisfied with their category/subcategory options. Nor was I satisfied with Shopify. \\n\\nI feel like a lot of these SaaS e-commerce platforms are made for &lt; 50 products. , https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0365/6633/products/P4U-IPV4B-2.jpg?v=1430478570, I agree with you on this. Companies like Hootsuite and Shopify represent one of the best hopes we have as a country to diversify our economy away from resource extraction. They create high paying jobs, help to develop our human resource base, and may eventually form the nucleus for dozens of startups attempting to replicate their success.\\n\\nThe tech industry in Vancouver in particular really seems to be nearing critical mass. Actions by our government to slow that down by attacking the leaders of this industry is economic malpractice of the worst kind., [This](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0622/7745/products/2013_wakarusa_grande.jpg?v=1411069775) is my favorite Wakarusa poster from 2013., Last I checked Shopify was not self-hosted so I\\'m not certain if they allow you to create a blog or not, but generally assuming that most of the SEO you\\'ve done has been off site (I don\\'t know how much shopify allows you to modify on site) then you should begin to seeing improved rankings once Google finds the backlinks to to your site. Which could be anywhere from Weeks to Months; Keep in mind SEO is a long term game., What did they do to the spoiler and wheels...ew.\\n\\nOn another note that 4th picture is an amazing color for the model S http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0196/5170/files/Ocean-Blue-Tesla_large.png?2551882404985557915, Thanks, that is essentially what I have been working towards.  In the product upload, Shopify does have fields for Description SEO and Keyword SEO, per each product.  I\\'ve made a formula that includes relevant keywords mixed with each product\\'s description.  Keep in mind that I have about ~7000 products.  In the meantime, I am going to make a strong social media push as well as invest a little into PPC.  Thanks for your response!, Free GA will tell you that sort of information. Shopify\\'s analytics are pretty worthless. , :/ Not a fan of the pricing.\\n\\nYou have a choice between $0 (but not 24h), $7 for 1 dyno, or $50 for 2 dynos.\\n\\nFor example, a lot of APIs, like Shopify for example, require 24h online access to receive data to be useful.\\n\\nIf it\\'s 18 hours for 3 dynos, why not 24 hours for one?, Awesome suggestions, thanks so much!! I was definitely leaning towards Shopify too, but someone told me about Squarespace which is relatively new and I had a coupon code so I was thinking about giving them a try. I\\'ll definitely stay away from Wix, thanks so much for the suggestions!!, Link to her online store: http://tru-man-3.myshopify.com/, Tee Turtle is having a sale and everything is cute and I\\'m so broke I can\\'t stand it [lookatem!](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0267/4223/products/undersea-trainer-clean_large.jpg?v=1429116742), This is my first ever ecoommerce site so I never used anything besides wordpress - shopify was tempting but I\\'m put off by all its fees. I just got a theme that was compatible with woocommerce and figuring how out how to use it was very easy, I\\'ve never used anything else besides woocommerce for ecommerce, but I chose it over shopify because is doesn\\'t have practically any fees. If you have some experice with setting up hosting, a domain, and using g WordPress I would probebly go with woocommece, Expensive meaning the only the only teas I can afford from them are jin xuan and four seasons.\\n\\n\\nTheir prices are on their website.

You can\\'t go wrong with either in my opinion. Less time dealing with tech. More time growing the business and trying to make that first sale. \\n\\nThat\\'s been my experience anyways., I think that having a business with personality is something that\\'s EXTREMELY underestimated. Look at Andrew from EcommerceFuel and his [recent re-design of his radio store](http://www.ecommercefuel.com/shopify-vs-magento/). Here are 2 great examples of making his company more human by using some great copy:\\n\\n\\n&gt;**1. New Order Confirmation Copy**\\n\\n&gt;All was quiet today until the Right Channel warehouse intercom crackled to life:\\n\\n&gt;“Listen up, people! We’ve got a new order for Mike from St. Louis…….”\\n\\n&gt;….but no one could hear the rest of the announcement over the thunderous roar of applause. Champagne bottles were popped. Tears of joy were shed. “Don’t Stop Believing” rang from every speaker. Even Alan our peak packer smiled—and Alan never smiles.\\n\\n&gt;Simply put, your order caused pandemonium and everyone is thrilled you’re now a customer. Thank you!\\n\\n&gt;Once we clean up our celebration mess, we’ll be working to get your order packaged, shipped and on it’s way to you ASAP. If you have any questions or problems, you can reply to this email or contact us by clicking here. We’ll follow up with with tracking information as soon as your package ships so you’ll know exactly when to expect delivery.\\n\\n&gt;**2. Some Cheeky Product Copy**\\n\\n&gt;If you’ve got a “Big Mama” on your vehicle (that’s trucker slang for a big antenna and, coincidentally, our nickname for Mike’s girlfriend), then you know how important it is to keep it protected under any circumstance. This Heavy-Duty CB Antenna Spring will keep the base of your antenna flexible, with just enough give so the road doesn’t take. \\n\\nBased on his own results, his customers loved it. Now will this work for all industries? Who knows. I\\'ve always subscribed to the mantra of people loving to buy from other people, not companies. In other words, the more human you seem (by being humorous aka. human), the greater chance for a potential sale.\\n\\nedit: reddit newbie formatting edits needed\\n, Thanks for the source, I did find them [there]( http://soleseriouss.myshopify.com/products/nike-roshe-run-tie-dye) however they look slightly different - yours appear to have more green, at least based on that one picture. Did you get them from Seriouss directly? , So do you take payment for your services and then buy the domain using that money or do you make separate charges? and do you just have reseller hosting that you use for all your clients? does this mean that you actually own the site? \\n\\nI feel like shopify and woocommerce will be big sellers for me since I\\'m targeting small businesses without the ability to process payments online and I\\'m worried that they won\\'t be happy seeing me charge them and then seeing that they were charged again by shopify etc.. Does that happen and if so how do you deal with it?\\n\\nThank you so much for taking the time to write your reply, really appreciated! , Oh for sure, and I encourage it (although I\\'d prefer a backlink to our shopify store). It\\'s hands down one of the better long term approaches we\\'ve taken., Thanks for sharing that link, I didn\\'t know about GrowthTalk, but I\\'ll definitely share the post there.\\n\\nI\\'m not very familiar with eBay and Shopify optimization as I haven\\'t used either. I\\'d guess that on Ebay you have to focus on right product images, good product descriptions, and you must have flawless feedback. You should absolutely check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRJbDWa639A) It\\'s almost 4 hours long video about selling on Amazon and Ebay. They go in depth about using [TerraPeak](http://www.terapeak.com/) which is an analytics and optimization software for eBay and Amazon. Worth going trough the whole video!\\n\\nRegarding Shopify optimization. Shopify is one of the solidest eCommerce CMSs in terms of SEO optimization, so you\\'d be pretty good go to with the out of the box setup they have. You\\'ll still need to invest some time in unique product copy, optimizing headlines, alt tags, etc., *I nod and quickly draw and then color [a knee high panda](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0103/8482/products/Panda_necklace_medium.jpg?v=1352237874).

Most font styles are the same because its easy to read., If you\\'re hitting Shopify\\'s limit, you may need to move up to Shopify Plus which overs quite a higher limit., It\\'s possible to market on Pinterest, and there is good reason to do so. Visual content is suitable for content marketing campaigns too. Infographics can do very, very well. \\n\\nAccording to Shopify, Pinterest users are 10% more likely to buy than those referred from other sources. \\n\\nAlso, Pinterest drives 300% more revenue per click than Twitter and 27% more than Facebook.\\n\\nMarketers rely on user-generated content on Pinterest to build social proof. Granted this works best for clothes and other forms of physical merchandise. But online brands have found success with it too. \\n\\nInfluencers can help a marketer (assuming they want to) by pinning their (tactfully made and visually interesting) marketing materials and linking them to the marketer\\'s webpage. The marketer then places a form on the page to capture emails. , I honestly think Woocommerce is the favorite of developers because it gives them work to do and it is easy for their customers to run. If you\\'re trying to do it all on your own, you can easily turn into a part time site developer trying to get everything right. \\n\\nA perfect example is updating Wordpress and having all of your perfectly selected and configured stuff break completely and then trying to scramble to get your shop running again. The alternative is to never update your stuff but then your site becomes more vulnerable every day.

You are correct that this is an issue within Accumula as it is rare that you will need a higher limit within Shopify\\'s API.\\n\\nIf you can\\'t get the issue resolved on Accumula there is nothing reasonable Shopify can do to help because they do not have access to the Accumula app to make the changes. , I learned the basics in 4-H with my old man dog of learning how to brush them and make him look like a dog and not a mop. \\n\\nAs for Sadie, I learned from her breeder how to groom her for the show, but we also learned from others around us and me watching what other people were doing with the same breed. I learned that a pumice stone is an amazing tool for stripping the coat. Now that we\\'ve gotten into hunting, we\\'ve learned a lot more about grooming- apply Cowboy Magic to her head before going, let her dry off before brushing, and use an [Ergonomic Shedding Comb](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0141/5542/products/d_837-01_grande.jpeg?v=1342126747) for all purposes. \\n\\nIn our breed, we also have two DVDs- One for how to groom a PBGV for the show ring, and one on how to groom them in general to keep their coats healthy and not matted. \\n\\nI think a breeder needs to be the one to teach the people how to groom, or even other owners. Heck, even a groomer can have someone watch what they\\'re doing!, I know you aren\\'t looking for feedback on strategy, however, pinterest may not work well for you. Pinterest has a dominate female user base. For Pinterest there is a 13% men marketshare and the percentage of those wanting your product is supremely low. Also, finding a woman that will buy your products for their men is low. Your product is attracting that rugged outdoors men (or atleast, it seems that way.) You may get pins but there won\\'t be a lot of buyers, your conversions will be really low, I would guess &lt;1% even with a phenomenal pr Pinterest expert.  \\n\\nI would try to latch on to existing markets such as monthly subscriptions boxes (as a way to mass sell your product), guest blogging on outdoors camping style sites, outdoor movements like the tiny home movement, market using cpm utilization on buysellads, Facebook ads might work well with your style of business in an extremely targeted niche, and writing a well targeted ebook for those outdoors type of people. \\n\\nBuild a tribe of people you want to be associated with, collect those people and tell a story. Your website already tells a great story through the use of photos that attract your niche demographic.

For simplicity, it\\'s unbeatable. You can always scale up and use a different platform down the road but I launched two online stores within a matter of days on Shopify and I have very limited design skills (www.giftsforatenner.com and www.fest-equip.com).\\n\\nYou get a 14-day free trial with Shopify to test them out, and linking your domain isn\\'t difficult.\\n\\nThere is a step-by-step explanation for each stage if you get stuck and loads of answers on Google for other stuff.\\n\\nYou can choose from a selection of free themes or purchase one of the premium ones. Honestly, I\\'ve been really impressed with the service I\\'ve had with Shopify and if you\\'re in the same boat as me, I don\\'t think you can go wrong with them., Shopify is as simple as it gets for Ecommerce. Plus you get a $100 Adwords credit and a $50 fb ads credit as well. You could use that for ad testing to possibly help you find 1 or 2 winning ad copies., Great question, for me anyway.  I found this. Maybe others will comment on the snapshot comparison.

They are neutral to easily go with your black and white dress, but have some hue for more visual interest. With that, I would keep any other jewelry fairly simple (e.g. thin bangle, simple ring, etc.).\\n\\nIn terms of a purse, I would pair the dress with a clutch that has a solid/bold pop of [colour](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/c0/ae/52/c0ae524344e18f23c20db4737d274abc.jpg), or alternatively, a metallic sequin in a more neutral tone if that\\'s more your style, like [this](http://images.asos-media.com/inv/media/6/6/5/7/5087566/pewter/image1xl.jpg) or [this](http://www.lookbookstore.net/Pictures/BA-074/BA-074-0.jpg).\\n\\nFinally, for shoes I would go with a classic black (or other neutral) pump; closed-toe is your safest best for a more formal reception. The slightly pointed toe on [this](http://s.shoespie.com/images/product/10/10466/10466281_10.jpg) heel gives it a polished, refined edge.\\n\\nHope that helps and maybe gives you some ideas!

But in response to his comment shopify is specifically for Ecommerce while wix isn\\'t. The services shopify provide you for an Ecommerce site is more than worth it so price is kind of a mute point. I doubt wix also has the available themes, plugins, Google ad credit, fb ad credit. I can\\'t say I\\'ve ever needed to contact customer service. There\\'s no coding skills necessary for shopify., My wife and I tried Wix.com which did work. Shopify was superior in every way for our needs as a small E-commerce company. Templates help you get bootstrapped quickly, the templates are editable with maybe twenty four hours HTML studying and problem solving. Shopify processes your credit cards and can integrate easily with paypal. , Wix has 100+ free themes and numerous paid themes.  You get Google and Bing credits.  It is far more customizable having used both for a new user.\\n\\nI don\\'t mind the downvotes, I tried both and found wix incredibly easy for setting up my store.  Simply my personal experience.  Wix also had almost every plug in I wanted, possibly not as many as shopify but they definitely have built up their ecommerce features.  Have you used both?, In addition, migrating away from Wix was a complete nightmare. Wix does not grant you access to your items in any sort of export and will not support the process of switching to or from Wix. I wound up taking a day or two off my main job and plain ol\\' copying and pasting the item data into a spreadsheet. I did look into web scraping the data however Wix has the data segmented so heavily in JavaScript calls that it was just easier to copy and paste 150 items ( name, description, variety, cost, weight, etc) into Shopify\\'s product import CSV template. , I have, but I am a data nerd. Wix did not have the reporting and analysis tools available to allow me to say... determine my highest selling item for the month. In order to do that with Wix I would have had to scrape the data out of Paypal\\'s itemized invoices and then play with it. Shopify has these reporting tools available at the 80/mo level and you can export your sales data to draw your own reports up with Excel.\\n\\nDo you do any sort of reporting with Wix? After my experience with them I am genuinely baffled and want to understand more about why they have an eCommerce following at all. Please note this is a genuine request for your perspective. , Is he talking about the [Viberg WW1 Trench Boots](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0211/7310/products/Trench_Nat_CXL_RO1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1422907263) specifically?, I can tell you from experience that everyone I know who is the \"creator\" of their product (usually an artisan of some sort) has the hardest time juggling both the craft and wrapping their head around the tech stuff. However, everyone is an individual. It may be easy for you.\\n\\nYou will save hundreds if not thousands on start up costs if you do it all yourself.\\n\\nShopify is indeed the easiest platform for eCommerce. I\\'ve developed heavily on this platform for clients and they are quick to pick up. The backend of Shopify is straight forward. From adding products, to marketing, to payment processing. You will be able to do this all yourself on Shopify. There are lots of great extensions in the Shopify community to enhance marketing down the road.\\n\\nFor beginners, launch your Shopify store with Paypal and Stripe (accept credit cards). Don\\'t worry about other third party payment gateways and monthly costs for this. Paypal and Stripe are free and you\\'re only charged a processing fee as orders roll in.\\n\\nI don\\'t know much about jewelry or the hazards that may be accompanied with it. But if you want a legitimate business, make sure you protect personal assets by forming a proper business structure.\\n\\nFor all business registration stuff use LegalZoom. \\n\\neCommerce, use Shopify. Start off on their cheapest plan. Bigger plans don\\'t make your site more search engine optimized, or faster for that reason. There is however more storage and marketing available like being able to re-target abandoned shopping carts.\\n\\nI\\'ve always told people that create their own product to get on the internet ASAP.

Instead of attaching it to the shoulder holster harness, though, I\\'d just use a Tek-Lok and carry it horizontally on my belt in a cross draw, allowing you to draw the knife in a forward grip in your strong hand, or a reverse grip in your weak hand (Big Boss style).\\n\\n\\nFor pistols, I\\'d try to get an airsoft Sig Sauer P229 (although the P226 looks a bit more like the Silver Ghost) and consider getting an airsoft FN Five-seveN (the pistol the Punisher\\'s based on) for the shoulder holster, because they\\'re the standard issue pistols for the Secret Service, apparently. If not the Five-seveN, then I\\'d go with an airsoft Glock 19, because of how easily Leon would be able to find more Glock magazines. I\\'d then add either the SureFire XC1, X300 Ultra or X400 Ultra WeaponLight.\\n\\n\\nIf I felt like upping the ante, I\\'d probably go with an airsoft MP5 (supposedly the standard issue sub-machine gun for the Secret Service) with a Magpul MS3 Gen 2 Sling, but for some reason, I really like the idea of him using an MP5 PDW, probably because it\\'s a sort of cross between the standard issue MP5 and the TMP from the game. I would also use an HSGI Costa Padded Leg Panel and fill it with Regulation Tactical Reflex Pouches, but they haven\\'t made Reflex Pouches for MP5 mags, yet.\\n\\nhttp://media.midwayusa.com/productimages/2200x1650/Primary/351/351088.jpg\\n\\nhttps://www.magpul.com/products/ms3%C2%AE-sling-gen-2\\n\\nhttp://www.galls.com/photos/styles/TP628_1500_1.JPG\\n\\nhttp://www.highspeedgear.com/hsgi/leg-panel-20MDL1.html\\n\\n\\nInstead of open finger gloves (which I also think are becoming outdated), I\\'d go with full finger gloves, probably the Blackhawk SOLAG Gloves with Kevlar.\\n\\nhttp://www.blackhawk.com/Products/Gloves-Protective-Gear/Gloves/Tactical/S-O-L-A-G-%E2%84%A2-Gloves-with-KEVLAR%C2%AE.aspx\\n\\n\\nAnd finally, watches. I think Leon\\'s a little too fancy for a G Shock, so I\\'d probably go with the SureFire 2211 Luminox WristLight.\\n\\nhttp://www.surefire.com/illumination/wristlights/2211-luminox-wristlight.html\\n\\n\\nSo... I think that\\'s everything I\\'ve got. It would be nice to see how it turns out, but good luck, either way., I think it would be awesome if someone could record the supporter section when the chants / songs are happening.

I\\'m in a similar boat as you, just launched my first e-commerce site. I knew nothing about selling anything online, and shopify has made it really really simple.\\n\\nIn my opinion it\\'s best to bootstrap as much as you can and just grind it out at first. Meaning doing everything yourself and learning the entire process of your business. You need to have experience in every aspect even if you decide to outsource it later.\\n\\n\\nThe distribution of profit is a tough one. First think about how much they contribute to the overall business. Take every single little part of the business and add it up. Then take his contribution and figure out how much he contributes to the whole thing. Then it\\'ll give you an idea of where to start as far as negotiation with him goes. I would warn you though of bringing in people that don\\'t have your mission in mind. If they aren\\'t 100% on board for you, you\\'ll end up having issues. \\n\\nJust my .02\\n\\nGood luck\\n, Live your life, don\\'t let anyone tell you how to live.

If you are having problems see them.** But I will tell you what I\\'ve had to do to alleviate wrist issues. \\n\\nOne thing I learned when I got RSI and had to do physio was that you will often have one of two types in your wrist. \\n\\n[\\\\(See picture\\\\)](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0472/7665/files/tennis_elbow_stretch_extensor_Elbow_Revive_grande.jpg?279) Either you have trouble bending your wrist back towards you (the 2nd diagram), or you have trouble bending it downwards (the first diagram). \\n\\nI had the second type. \\n\\nMy physiotherapists said that basically you need to try to try to balance out how your wrists move. If they are always held in a certain position, every so often (like once every 30 mins), you need to stretch them in the opposite direction. \\n\\nIdeally you would also spend far less time on the computer. \\n\\nMy hands were always curled towards the keyboard, so I had to stretch them in the same fashion as the 2nd diagram. This is a good start, but honestly if you\\'re having pains **see someone about it**. \\n\\nOften the pains in your extremities are due to issues closer to your spine, and so I needed a lot of therapy on my shoulders too. \\n\\n**It\\'s not worth needing surgery because you didn\\'t visit a physio/doctor early enough. If you have pains see them as soon as you can.** , This track is definitely not for everyone, it\\'s very harsh and loud, but I love the concept behind it. Nahvalr is an open source black metal band ran by Dan Barrett and Tim Macuga from Have a Nice Life. From 2006-2008 they collected sound samples from audio people emailed to them, these samples pretty much consisted of anything from screaming to ambient recordings of fields, and then mixed them together to create this song and the album it\\'s on. Dan coined the term open source black metal as a way to describe the collaborative effort of dozens of people to create the album. It\\'s not open source in the truest sense but anyone who wanted to submit an audio file had it added to the record. \\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested you can read more about how it was made [here.](https://enemies-list-home-recordings.myshopify.com/products/nahvalr-nahvalr-digital), I have had both and the Lemo 2 is by far superior to its predecessor. I mean, the dumb fill port, extremely inconvenient air flow control. On top of that, the Lemo 1 is one [ugly](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0569/9133/products/LemoSS1_grande.jpg?v=1416529528) tank. The Lemo 2 has dope updated looks. Honestly, I don\\'t see how this is a hard choice for you. What do you not like about the Lemo 2?, I am going to take a different tack and recommend the Shopify platform. I was asked at work to create an ecommerce mini site quickly; I had a a little more experience than you have, but not a ton more. I was able to customize a stock theme to meet our brand requirements pretty easily; liquid is a mustache like syntax. We had about a dozen products with a few variants each; very easy to import. Also worked with our payment gateway. Ten months later, $50,000 in sales for just these products, customers love it, customer relations loves the order system, a win win for everyone. , It really is incredible what modern capitalism enables us to do. [Enjoy](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0667/8641/products/Enjoy-Capitalism-T-Shirt.png?v=1417035746), Honestly the free themes from Shopify are a better choice for you at this point.  Not only are they better looking they work on mobile devices as well.\\n\\nBuilding e-commerce sites is a huge pain in the ass if you want to do it right.  Let Shopify do its job.  If you really want to create a custom theme go for it.  , [Hans J. Wegner\\'s Y-chair / Wishbone chair /CH24](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0270/5873/products/hans-wegner-wishbone-chairs-walnut-in-room-ch24-carl-hansen-and-son_1024x1024.jpg?v=1422738155)\\n\\n\\n\\nHans J. Wegner was born in 1914 in Tønder, the son of a shoemaker. At the age of 17 he was apprenticed to a carpenter (H. F. Stahlberg) and it was at this time that he developed his first design. At the age of 20 he moved to Copenhagen to study at the institution now known as The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Design but which back then went under the more modest title of \"The Artisan College.\"\\n\\nHe studied there from 1936-1938, before taking further studies as an architect. In 1940 Wegner initiated a joint project with Arne Jacobsen and Erik Møller in Aarhus, which involved fitting out Aarhus\\' town hall. It was also in 1940 that Wegner began to work with Master Carpenter Johannes Hansen, a man who played a significant role in bringing modern design to the Danish public. The then Copenhagen Industrial Art Museum (now Design Museum Denmark) purchased their first Wegner chair in 1942. Hans J. Wegner opened his own design studio in 1943, and in 1944 he designed his first \"China Chair\" in a series inspired by the Chinese Emperor\\'s thrones.\\n\\nOne of the chairs in this series is what is probably Wegner\\'s most famous work \"The Wishbone Chair,\" which he designed in 1949, and which Carl Hansen &amp; Søn have manufactured since 1950. Hans J. Wegner is regarded as one of the world\\'s outstanding furniture designers. He was one of the motive forces behind the Danish Modern movement which did much to change people\\'s view of furniture in the 1950s and 60s. His design retain relevance for us today and his sense for details is a source of constant wonder.\\n\\nWegner has received a number of prizes and recognitions. Amongst other things, he is an honorary member of The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and has received an honorary doctorate from the Royal College of Art in London. He was also the first ever recipient of the Lunning Prize and received the 8th International Design Award in Osaka, Japan. His works are exhibited at major international museums including The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York and Die Neue Sammlung in Munich.\\n\\nHans J. Wegner died in Denmark in January 2007\\n\\nHans J. Wegner\\'s contributions to Danish design:\\n\\nA master carpenter first and a designer second: Perfectly finished joints and exquisite forms.\\n\\nA deep respect for the wood and its character and an everlasting curiosity about good materials.\\n\\nHe gave minimalism an organic and natural softness.\\n\\nHe is considered as \"the master chair-maker\" and designed more than 500 chairs during the course of his life., [Pretty much what I expected](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0036/8682/products/gallery-poisonplum_1_grande_large.jpg?v=1368571456), I will when I get my 5th pair :) still looking to cop these [Nigos](http://www.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/12/files/2015/03/adidas-originals-stan-smith-velcro-by-nigo-01.jpg), these [Onyx Raf Simons](http://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2014/07/Adidas-SS15-by-Raf-Simons_dezeen_468_0.jpg), and these [Opening Ceremony Pony Hair](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0049/9112/products/Adidas-x-Opening-Ceremony-Stan-Smith-BLK-2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1411066538), [Ronin Division](http://www.ronindivision.com/collections/frontpage)  \\n[Mutant Minds](http://mutantminds.bigcartel.com/)  \\n[Apparel K](http://apparelk.bigcartel.com/)  \\n[HVY BLK CULT](http://www.hvyblkcult.com/)  \\n[Never Stop Infinity](http://www.neverstopinfinity.com/shirts/)  \\n[1992](http://1992gear.com/collections/all)   \\n[OMOCAT](http://www.omocat-shop.com/) Site is closed at the moment, but here are some of their designs: [1](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0330/1705/products/IMG_6664_1024x1024.jpg?v=1392360798) [2](http://40.media.tumblr.com/6f52617ca65e26781463a45b7b24a112/tumblr_n3mdcxYyVB1qegob8o1_1280.png) [3](http://41.media.tumblr.com/bf912408ec54fe782e3b72bbd58bae1d/tumblr_mpa4p3ycNb1qegob8o6_1280.jpg)\\n\\n, [Currywurst](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0768/0649/files/IMG_3091_Kopie.jpg?4075647638141523401), The reason you\\'re getting that is because the actual website is run through [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com), but the domain is bluedotvapors.com.

There are more PrestaShop stores than there are shopify, woo commerce, big commerce, and volusion stores combined. It is top notch, I think for market share it might be right behind magento in number of sites. , CNC milled 1590G style enclosure with 6mm extra internal height (should be about 27.7mm from internal bottom to underside of lid). No lean/drafted side either.\\n\\nhttps://modcrate.myshopify.com/collections/enclosures/products/1590g-tall-boy?variant=1436690948, It\\'s fantastic you\\'re getting a lot of buzz, but it\\'s still just emails and instagram followers. It\\'s not cash. Prepare yourself for a low conversion rate. \\n\\nIf you\\'re really worried, you could stagger your emails/instagram announcements. Call it an early access lottery, pick 50 emails at random and email them. Then the next 50 emails a couple of days later, then the next 50 emails if you can handle the volume. Or even a first come, first served. So give the first 50 signups a  chance to buy, then the next 50, and so on.\\n\\nIf you\\'re worried about getting flooded by instagram followers, set a stock limit. You haven\\'t told us how you\\'re selling/taking money. Why not setup a shopify account? It handles all that for you! Then you can set shopify to stop selling when out of stock, set a stock of X, where X is what you think you can make in a reasonable time period, and then send it out to your instagram followers. Shopify will stop people buying more when you hit that magic limit.\\n\\nAnd then you can announce  when you\\'re ready to take more, or scale up production by hiring someone when the cash has cleared., [I have my own shirt!](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0129/8532/products/Team_Electroclan_Shirt_grande.jpg?v=1366327966), Well instead of the typical single loop in step one like [this](http://old.tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IanKnot1B.gif), all you need to do is make a double loop like [step one here](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0508/8929/files/windsor-knot-shoelace_grande.jpg?166). That extra loop helps keep the knot tight and won\\'t loosen when you let go to tie the ears. , Careers that are exploding:\\n\\nComputational sciences and software development. Computers have revolutionized society, and they have done so thanks to the rigorousness of computational theory and theoretical computer science (computer science is basically math, after all) that paved the way for efficient, elegant algorithm and program design. Unlike during the dotcom bubble burst in 2001, software development appears to be recession-proof this time around. People were being fired left and right during the 2008 economic meltdown, but software remained fairly strong. And while this has led to a flood of people entering computer science programs in university (like UC Berkeley\\'s 1000-student CS 61A class), unlike law or pharmacy, it\\'s very hard (Is it NP-hard?) in that abstract, lateral way that few students are exposed to in public school. It\\'s problem solving, not game development, and as such can scare off a lot of people. \\n\\nThe highest level of demand will be in distributed, large-scale web services (e.g. Amazon, Google), mobile development, bioinformatics, data mining and data science, large-scale computer networks, computation related to hardware, communications systems and sensors, human-computer interaction, multimedia systems, parallel computing, and cryptography/security. On the theoretical side, artificial intelligence as related to cognitive science and machine learning is hot, as is natural language processing, and complexity theory as it relates to quantum computing. \\n\\nThe BLS job title of \"Software developers, applications\", has made the list of occupations with the most job growth (by 2022, the projection is that the number of jobs will grow from 613,000 to 752,900, a jump of 23%, with 218,500 job openings in all). \\n\\nIt\\'s quite healthy in Canada, too, although you won\\'t make Bay Area or Seattle salaries. (Or NYC salaries. Or hell, even Austin or Boston salaries!) The strong US dollar skews things but salaries in large municipalities (Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal) are similar to salaries in Chicago, LA, San Diego, etc. This may be because computer science programs in Canada are far more theoretical than the applied, engineering-oriented BS degrees in the US, and the reason for that is engineering in Canada is a cult, and engineering degrees are tied to the professional practise of engineering, unlike in the US where you can call yourself whatever you want. (e.g. a \"Software Engineer\" in Canada would be someone working on embedded or microcontroller software for a nuclear power station, or GPS head unit, not a dev working on the AWS payment platform)\\n\\nThe University of Waterloo has made southern Ontario a software hub, and Kitchener-Waterloo has a Google shop. Research in Motion is a shell of itself, and Nortel is long gone, but Ottawa has a Palantir shop and is the home of Shopify. \\n\\nVancouver has fairly large Amazon and Salesforce shops and of course is the home of Hootsuite, whose success (Twitter\\'s current API restrictions mean it\\'s harder now to develop a competitor) sparked a [healthy startup scene](http://angellist.co/vancouver). VC is not hard to come by thanks to the weak loonie, which makes Canadian companies more attractive to US investors. \\n\\nIn fact, big Bay Area/Seattle tech companies have many incentives to expanding in Canada:\\n\\n* Universal health care and cheaper post-secondary education, spend less on employee benefits \\n\\n* Adequate public transportation in many Canadian cities (especially compared to transit in SF and the Puget Sound), so companies don\\'t have to shell out money to set up shuttle buses or a car service. \\n\\n* Strong US dollar and salaries nowhere near the Bay Area or Seattle. Salesforce saves about 40% in salary expenses by hiring a dev in the Vancouver office compared to a dev in Austin, TX.\\n\\n* The Government of Canada\\'s SR&amp;ED tax credit\\n\\nOn the subject of computers, computer engineering is another hot field. Real-time, embedded software, sensors, semiconductors are all hot. Aerospace, clean fuels, even software jobs...the sky is the limit.\\n\\nElectrical engineering will become huge as clean tech starts expanding. Power transmission and storage will be very important.\\n\\nMechanical engineering--but then again, MechEs can do anything.\\n\\nChemical engineering. Drops in oil prices aside, chemical engineers deal with the physics and thermodynamics of chemical processes with respect to transporting, purifying and scaling up raw materials. This is harder to outsource. As such, chemical engineering is growing, so long as you stay away from the oilfield for now.\\n\\nHOLY CRAP, ANYTHING IN HEALTHCARE. (With the exception of nursing. Nursing is also saturated in Canada.) Physiotherapists, X-ray technicians, pharmacy technicians (but not pharmacists), dental technicians...\\n\\nSkilled trades, with some caveats. In many large cities, especially in the northeast, there is a bit of \"if it was so easy everyone would have done it\" going on. Certain trades are saturated, so you may have to go out to a rural area. Depending on where you live and what trade it is, \"The Union\" might call the shots and stifle new hires. Many trades can be boom or bust and taxing on the body (plumber and electrician are a bit of an exception). \\n\\nIn Canada, tradesmen can make lots of money in rural areas, but the days of making coin 16 days on 16 days off in Fort McMurray are over with the drop in oil prices. There is a shortage of trade instructors in BC (because who would take that kind of salary cut to teach especially with a Red Seal?), and it\\'s unregulated so apprentice trademen can get hosed on salary just so the company can fund its baller lifestyle (if you don\\'t believe me ask /u/Meowjin over in /r/vancouver). The main trades school, BCIT, has [two year waitlists](http://www.bcit.ca/admission/apply/tradeswaitlist.shtml) for many programs, and in spite of the long wait it\\'s actually not as bad now as it was 18 months ago. The provincial government had to give the school an extra [$800,000](http://commons.bcit.ca/update/2014/07/more-access-reduced-waitlist-for-trades-training-seats-at-bcit/) in funding to open up more seats in welding, pipe fitting and other apprenticeship programs in anticipation of a future LNG boom. But now with the drop in oil prices, state oil companies in Asia find it cheaper to extract the natural gas at home, so who knows what will happen?, I also live in the PNW and [these are my rain shoes](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0161/1528/products/dr_Martens_Amory_Black_Smooth_1024x1024.png?v=1351740351). They\\'re essentially a Dr Marten 1461 with a heel. They\\'re totally rain and slip proof, and the heel is good for my high arches., From my understanding, magento is the ecommerce gaint. I have experienced shopify, volusion, woocommerce, opencart, virtuemart, etc, while comparing with those, magento seems to be more powerful than those., &gt;A lower-sodium option and options for different flavors would be great as well.\\n\\nAccording to [here, a pdf of v1.4 soylent](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0421/5993/t/14/assets/files_Complete-Soylent-Nutrition-Facts-1p4.pdf?2850945328223203203), Soylent 1.4 is already low-sodium and isn\\'t even a good source your recommended daily amount and you should supplement it somehow if you\\'re going 100% soylent.  It really isn\\'t a problem if soylent is being used as a supplement though, because most people\\'s diets are already pretty high sodium., Lack of variable pricing is definitely one of Shopify\\'s shortcomings.\\n\\nFor your current situation, the easiest workaround would be to price your roasts/steaks per gram (or ounce, or whatever your minimum unit would be) and change the quantity to match the current item you\\'re selling., Take the time to learn about Wordpress and hosting and you\\'ll liberate yourself from the costs and restrictions of having to turn to others. Alternatively take a look at squarespace.com, wix.com, or shopify.com if you\\'re trying to sell online., are you one of the [deers](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0312/6677/products/deersdemo_grande.jpg), Yeah I would use Magento if I was planning a big store and had a big budget. There is a lot of time and effort involved in setting your store up and maintaining it. \\n\\nI have used Shopify and Prestashop but would likely choose Prestashop over the two as it\\'s free and because I didn\\'t like that you couldn\\'t use a dedicated SSL certificate on Shopify. , This [previously recommended cable](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/collections/accessory/products/micro-to-micro-otg?variant=211796287) has been sold out for the last few months, and when it was in stock had very expensive international shipping.\\n\\nThe ebay cable is under $2, including shipping, and works perfectly.  I would criticise it for being too long (at least 20cm, but not the 1m described on ebay).  No harm in ordering just 1 since shipping is free ;-), use [this!](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0170/0270/products/Phases_900x900_1024x1024.png?v=1350423162) to make her remind the steps. Maybe as a playmat that helps remind her., There\\'s New55 R3 Monobath, just one bath and reusable for $20 (US Only).\\nhttp://new55-film.myshopify.com/products/r3-monobath-developer, If just for the summer then Panama hats would work with the clothing you\\'re talking about. Just don\\'t wear them in the rain or they\\'ll lose their shape. [This is where I get my Panama hats](http://the-panama-hat-works-of-montecristi.myshopify.com/) Light linen or cotton flat or newsboy caps can also work well in the summer. For winter there is a lot of variety out there from fedoras to cowboy hats. If you are interested in felt hats then avoid wool felt and go for fur felt as it\\'s exponentially more durable. Akubra is a good brand for price/quality. Is there a hat shop anywhere close to you where you can try some different styles on and see what you like? , Not particularly *sour* but Watermelon Crack by Bleux Vapor is pretty fantastic.

According to AdWords, \"Wing Shooter\" variations are not coming up very often in the searches - anywhere from 600-1100 per month. I See you\\'re using Shopify. I know they will eat part of your earnings of course, but I\\'d recommend lowering the cost per shirt to at least get a sale. Even know you won\\'t be making much, it sounds like more of a lesson and bonding situation. Just my input. , For fast and easy for the customer I would also say Woo Commerce. But what about Shopify, or Magento?\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_software_e-commerce_web_application_frameworks, Thanks man. How much have you spent on prestashop? I dont have much money atm so im considering prestashop but im worried that i will need loads of addons to make it an effective store that i cant afford for the time being. Maybe it would be a better idea to go with shopify or something. , I have used Cart2Cart and found it very helpful. be mindful though that it will only migrate the things within Magento, not the add ins from third parties like a review component one client had. It was necessary to migrate those manually. The guy who runs http://www.ecommercefuel.com/ goes over a ton of Magento to Shopify stuff. He dropped 50k on the migration and redesign. Good luck if you haven\\'t done this already., And I mean, [this marketing is pretty good.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0152/0433/products/Cartoon_Heropage_1024x1024.jpg?v=1374095644)  Dem stick-figure ladies., Another ruched one I love (and ordered!): http://moanabikini.myshopify.com/collections/bottoms/products/double-rainbow-runch-btm, Don\\'t use Woo Commerce, go with a shopify or anything else first. , haha yeah mine\\'s white tho. you can buy one [here](http://play-cloths.myshopify.com/products/everything-is-pusha-t)., Just chiming in to say that this is the number one issue that I\\'ve had with Shopify since I started using it four years ago. Back then, support told me it was something they had on their development radar. Don\\'t know what happened.\\n\\nI haven\\'t found a solution, and am still tracking everything manually. It\\'s a drag., Thanks for the advice folks. I was worried that it was Accumula\\'s app or a problem with our initial integration as these systems are pretty delicate and can act strangely sometimes. Also looked into Shopify Plus for 1K/month but honestly our online store isn\\'t that big. That is for international companies that do millions and millions in online business every year.\\n\\nLuckly, I was finally able to get through to level 2 support for shopify and apparently someone from their team had manually reduced the limit to the amount of API calls that our app could make during some maintenance and it wasn\\'t reset when they were finished, causing the limit issue. \\n, well that\\'s depressing.

Users can still checkout via Guest login and your information will be safe through there because checkout is SSL protected.  I am so sorry if this has caused anyone any issues.  \\nThanks again for the catch. Send me a PM when you can please.  , If you\\'re only wanting customer info/notes etc the built in options in shopify may be all that you need. In the customer area in the admin you can add tags, and notes to each customer as well as being able to add notes and what not to specific orders as well. \\n\\nOn the accountancy side of things, we personally use Xero, it\\'s not a free one but the amount of time and effort it saves us makes it more than worth it for us. , [for everyone else who didn\\'t know what lit cosmetics was!](https://lit-cosmetics.myshopify.com/), Get somebody to proofread you site (you still have links to your shopify admin page on there)\\n\\nWhat is your site selling? I see a title called Guild of Magic, but no magic related items or tricks. You have 3 unrelated products on your homepage.\\n\\nYou should get some proper descriptions written up for your products., We use Shopify for both (ipad pos and online) and use it for the entirety of our stock tracking (other than a once-per-quarter stock discrepancy record in a spreadsheet), but we are probably much smaller in scope than you would be with tens of different products rather than the hundreds that I\\'m sure a sporting store would have. \\n\\nWith the ipad we have the advantage of being able to take out stock to markets and events (regular occurrences) and not have to worry much about consolidation with online/B&amp;M. , I remember reading a post last week from someone who used Startup Bros and did not get good results. I would suggest asking the above questions to the service provider. Most just reach out to media outlets and reporters on your behalf. I would rather have good feedback on how I can increase my userbase, fine tune my offering and price for maximum profit - the way Tim Ferris did for Shopify. Tim suggested a contest. You can read the details on his blog., Yeah we currently have in the Region of 200 products that we are selling. I did look at Shopify but they didn\\'t seem to have a Windows Application or an Online EPOS system that I could use for the Till in our Physical Store?

You can print on a good selection of styles, brands and colours (for instance American Apparel) https://www.theprintful.com/product/t-shirts\\n\\nYou can also print on demand and then sell on platforms like storenvy and shopify, without holding any stock., The people at [AgileCRM](https://www.agilecrm.com/shopify-integration) are fantastically supportive, and their platform has an app already built to integrate with Shopify. The platform is free to use for 2 users, though I\\'m not sure how much of the integration that covers. They\\'re worth talking with, definitely. It also handles a good bit of the marketing automation.\\n\\n\\n, We just released a video showing how to setup a Drupal store using Shopify in under 10 minutes.

Must have taken a while to break it into so many pieces! Nice work., My business partner and I actually built our own platform for the prints. I\\'m selling the shirts using Shopify., How does this compare to other open source and free products such as Shopify, OSCommerce, JBilling, OpenCart, and more?  Doesn\\'t Ebay have an open and flexible ecommerce solution that is extendable to support any currency/payment type?, I\\'d definitely keep it simple and give it a go with Shopify, if they need to scale up to a more indepth crm further down the line you can always import the existing notes into whichever crm you go for but in all honesty, for most people the combination of notes and tags is more than enough.  , Fair Question, this is the best I can answer right now.\\n\\nShopify isn\\'t opensource, or free.\\n\\nOsCommerce, OpenCart (and wordpress and drupal) are all Strict GPL PHP solutions without multi-licensing support, so I think they are not business friendly (they are to use, but not to extend in a for-profit way). I want a solution that businesses don\\'t hesitate to adopt as a foundation, and the GPL can be seen as a burden towards that. Also, I give no points to PHP, it\\'s over-used and under-quality compared to more robust solutions. I support a templating language for the web similar to PHP but without the need for complex scope or platform security concerns, especially in regards to new programmers.\\n\\nCan\\'t speak for JBilling, but it seems like it\\'s a subset of the features, it\\'s probably a very good billing system, but mine has a CMS and a API built in, as well as support for multiple organizations.\\n\\nAs for anything Ebay has, then you are just working with giant 3rd parties and somewhat defeats the purpose or ability to function independently., [Dwarven Forge Store](https://dwarven-forge.myshopify.com/pages/products), I\\'ll be camping out of a large geodome this year(holds 25 hammocks): [picture](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0673/7711/products/35_-_yiN2tJ5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1413703700)\\n\\nwe\\'ve got a big group camp, may be setting up a couple more smaller domes as well, I understand you are trying to stick it to the man by becoming the man and competing against other men.. but [Ebay has a](http://magento.com/legal/licensing) fully [open source](http://opensource.org/licenses/OSL-3.0) independent commerce [solution](http://magento.com/).  Which is completely [customizable  to support bitcoin](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/bitpay-bitcoin-payment-method.html) as well as a range of other additions.  It also has a CMS and API built-in and has the added benefit of being security tested against many many many large scale ecommerce deployments.\\n\\nThen there\\'s OpenCMS which is java based and LGPL which is business friendly.  Further all of my suggestions, even if GPL, are perfectly viable for business solutions since the usage will be in the form of SaaS which the GPL does not dictate source requirements until distribution.  The flipside is a business then extends your software and resells it putting them in direct competition with you.\\n\\nI think you should pause and not ask what /r/bitcoin wants but what /r/entrepreneur and /r/software or /r/java, etc need.  Businesses do not want bitcoin integration, they want solutions that offer responsive interfaces, easy configuration, quality reporting etc.  If it has bitcoin, that is a bonus, but bitcoin is not the killer feature that will turn a business away from Shopify to a solution that they must manage themselves.  Let me ask you this.  What does your software provide over every other existing suggestion I have provided?\\n\\nJust my satoshi based on your comments., http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6682/products/wwf_panda_bears_wrestle_t_shirt_1_large.png?v=1266852728, The [Walnut finish](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0332/7621/products/1_25438d4b-d71a-4516-8280-84126b2db13b.jpg?v=1401226065) is definitely the best. :P, [This image epitomizes](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0211/7310/files/GYW6_1024x1024.jpg?11660125442031100321) what aesthetic I dislike the least. I\\'m disappointed that the stitchdown has been abandoned, not because of any construction changes, but because of that welt aesthetic. I had looked forward to saving up for Vibergs, but I\\'ll stick with my stitchdown Santalums for now. , Shopify plus the Shippo plugin makes this REALLY simple for me.\\n\\nI don\\'t know if that would work for your organization, but holy cow., Mmkay.  You need to seriously take a step back, identify what you are trying to accomplish.. go over these licenses with a lawyer and then make a serious decision if this is worth the time.  Those three years invested will be great leverage for working for many many companies in the ecommerce field.  But based on your comments, if you pursue without doing the above then you will be on a railroad to disaster.\\n\\nYou have a slight misconception which creates a conflict in your statements.  How can you be against existing products primarily due to the GPL yet support AGPL which applies restrictions that further reduce business friendliness?  \\n\\nHow is your SaaS platform better than Salesforce or Shopify or any other platform that is out there?  How much will it cost to be competitive?  Say Shopify has a service for $9.99/month, how do you fit development, testing, research, operations, and continuity costs under your competition?  \\n\\nI\\'m just speaking from experience, this is not my first time seeing these types of ideas., all you need now is this: http://nflightcam-com.myshopify.com/products/gopro-propeller-filter\\n, I\\'d say use [this](http://high-class-retro.myshopify.com/) one.

It\\'s probably better than the standard american diet, but prove that it\\'s better than real food or at least make a convincing argument.  Chewing is hugely important for satiety.  I agree that in theory it could be better, but in practice, the processed food industry shows us that it\\'s better for their bottom lines and not much else http://www.nestle.com/media/newsandfeatures/nestle-satiety-study\\n\\nPer the ingredients of soylent, each pouch (500 calories) has 11 grams of sugar.  For a 2500 calorie diet (the average for men; the average woman eats 2000 calories) that\\'s 55 grams of added sugar, which is in excess of 25 grams recommended by the WHO, AHA, and USDA.  People complain about the blandness of soylent (I\\'d say that aspect of it is clearly worse; everything counts), which is why it has that much added sugar.  I eat zero.\\n\\nhttp://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0421/5993/t/14/assets/files_Complete-Soylent-Nutrition-Facts-1p4.pdf?2850945328223203203\\n\\nThere is also concern about xanthum gum which has been linked to Crohn\\'s disease through gut dysbiosis.  Maybe not an issue for you, but I have Crohn\\'s.  http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052132\\n\\nFurthermore, at 4 grams/500 calories, you\\'d be getting 16 g/2000 calories (the recommendation is ~25 g/2000 calories), which is well below the recommendation.  So again, potentially better...\\n\\n&gt; and we can make it better\\n\\nBut we don\\'t know how and it\\'s not like soylent is cheaper than food, There would be [two share classes](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-06/shopify-seeks-value-up-to-1-billion-in-dual-canada-u-s-ipo).

I can\\'t find someone doing similar in UK of any great scale and it would be an commerce store. It could be attractive to a wider variety of people but i decided to target 1 group in particular in the 1st instance - event runners.\\n\\nI managed to find a production partner and got a MVP made.\\n\\nI build a landing page and ran some Facebook ads.\\n\\n1) Landing page created 29th April has had 110 unique views, and generated 6 leads.\\n\\n2) Facebook ads. Started 29th April, I targeted a group of around 110,000 people who i thought were in my target market. Im running a  3 week campaign at a maximum of £3.00 per day with maximum click bid of £0.60.\\n\\nResults so far. 89 web clicks an average cost of £0.43 per click. Total reach is 8,649.\\n\\nI would say these stats are pretty dissapointing? I also took pictures of my manufactured product to sell on ebay at the price I had hoped to sell online for. Its had 124 page views but no purchasers. It is a very unique product and I\\'m now sure if i labelled it correctly / added to the correct section.\\n\\nI kind of fell like I\\'m stuck here as it is a relatively new concept here in the UK. Im not sure if i should get some more test products made up myself which i can then take pictures of and target new fans.\\n\\nI also planned to open a shop on shopify, but I\\'m bootstrapping and investing a lot of money on the product at an initial stage could be difficult.\\n\\nIm just not sure what direction to go in. Im happy to reveal the idea if anyone asks and I\\'m allowed to.\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\n\\n, * [The Volt SS (on top)](http://imgur.com/ohuX93W) has the lightest acid wash and the heaviest stonewash.

It may work for you too, I\\'m not sure I can help, but I would like to hear what your app does. Launching a store this week and apps have been very helpful, It\\'d be more one pager info pages.  I\\'m sure we\\'ll touch on eCommerce but I won\\'t have them building custom eCommerce sites, it\\'ll be customization of woocommerce or shopify., I found a niche. It is strong, it has a lot of room for expansion in similar areas, and it\\'s not very competitive. I used Google Adwords and its keywords tool to draw all the information above. Further, the product line appears with a good margin.  \\n  \\nI want to dropship this product line but I am concerned. Scared, if you will, of taking the leap. There\\'s so many questions on my mind: how do I find wholesalers? Am I expected to beat the entire competition(Amazon no doubt sells tons of different brands of the niche I\\'ve located, so how do I deal with that?)? Should I post the inventory line I want to sell without negotiating dropships with wholesalers?  \\n  \\nI\\'m planning on using Shopify and doing more market research today, but regardless, it is a scary height to be at. I\\'m dealing with product that easily hits $2000 here. I don\\'t want to fuck it up.

Say I purchase an Icon for my Shopify page, and I like someone else\\'s Icon, which is a link to their Tumblr. Is there a way to communicate within the app once she sees I\\'ve liked her Icon, or would I have to create a Tumblr if I wanted to contact her or ask her questions about this?\\n\\nI see a lot of information about the entire liking process, but not a whole lot on what happens after I\\'ve liked someone\\'s Icon or someone has liked mine. What exactly is in my Icon profile? Is it just my Icon and link of choice, or do I have an option to post status updates and genuinely connect with my liked Icons (and those who have liked mine) within that function? I generally like the concept of a new bulletin board-esque social network, but from what I\\'ve read in your Kickstarter, I\\'m not seeing a whole lot of social aspects to it.\\n\\nAlso, I would wholly remove the little bit that says people can post broken links intentionally. It immediately stood out as a red flag for me, kind of cheapening the experience in a way? Maybe it\\'s just me, but I think that ensuring links are active shows your customers that you care about their time. I don\\'t wanna see a kick-ass icon, get stoked as all hell about what the link might take me to, and then get 404d. Users might think the app is broken or could be peeved that they wasted their time on a broken link. Granted, I don\\'t think anyone would pay a dollar just to waste a link, but you never know.

If your limited in experience then I would stick to a builder such as Shopify mentioned above. This will give you a complete solution and package your hosting/site/cart/merchant into one monthly cost.\\n\\nIf you have some understand of how to build a site on your own - then I would look into Wordpress + Woo commerce. These two solutions are technically free but would require third party domain/hosting/merchant account/ssl to run.

Calling - A sizeable number of Shopify stores will have numbers that you can call.\\n2. E-mail - Cold e-mails can also work, but I feel they are somewhat less effective.\\n3. Provide personal customer service - if anyone has problems, call them and walk them through the problem. If your customers feel like you care, even if there are real issues with the app, they\\'ll still err on the side of giving you better reviews.\\n4. Ask for referrals. Often store owners will know at least a few other people also operating Shopify storefronts. Once you get one satisfied customer, get at least one referral from them.\\n\\nNote: Cold calling/e-mail tends to have 1-3% success rates, Yup, if you use shopify they\\'ll have this feature for you. , You can make a website with several different pages. Shopify is quite easy to learn and you can create a pretty much full featured website in shopify and have the added benefits of the cart and product listings etc all being automatically a part of the system. Lookup shopify store examples and see what you can achieve with it., Shopify is better. , Create a Wordpress site and then have the shop point to your Shopify store? , i have [this](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0240/9829/products/WHTFSU_Stepbrothers_Patch_1024x1024.jpg) , Sounds like a Saturday Liquidation type store.  I love this place.  Picked up a really expensive panhead tripod for half price.   \\nFun to wander around and lust over weird stuff you dont need at all.\\n\\nhttps://saturday-liquidation.myshopify.com/, Shopify gets my vote.  Great ecommerce platform with multiple payment methods.  Use a wordpress theme and your golden, so much potential.  $29/m for the basic Shopify hosting, and its everything my store needs.  , [His dethrone shirt is awesome IMO](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0186/7718/products/ConorCardBLK-FR.jpg?v=1410303742), Non technical Entrepreneur does not really need to know any of this stuff. \\n\\nThey should be hiring developers, using WordPress/Woocommerce or a service like Shopify, and focusing on what they are \"good\" at, and marketing/selling the service/product.\\n\\nNot learning about http requets or get/post etc, pretty irrelevant for a \"non technical\" entrepreneur in my opinion., http://hookupsofficial.myshopify.com, Very cool!\\n\\nJust a heads up there is an error here: https://app.getcoopt.com/login\\n\\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/vwwtbmetb2a23rj/Screenshot%202015-05-14%2012.00.54.png?dl=0, We are using them for our projects!  That\\'s what I am trying to point out to you.  We have several users using shopify, magento, opencart, and someone just asked for zencart today.  These are not small establishments, these are large multiserver deployments that generate between $7-16million revenue every year.  Can your software reliably handle $100m+ in cummulative sales across tens or hundreds of stores?  Reporting and analytics?\\n\\nHow will your software add value beyond what we already have?  AGPL will reduce any value we would gain in switching simply because it will increase our costs.  You are hosted? Well great, but there is Sales Force, Shopify, Magento SaaS, etc.  What makes your homegrown solution better and how does it lower my costs?  Sales Force, shopify, etc all provide SLAs and 24x7 support teams.  Do you provide that for $5 per user per month?  Do you even know how much your hosted solution costs per user per month?\\n\\nIf you\\'re not willing to work with me to make more money, then I will not work with your platform.  Are you understanding my \"contridicting\" points yet?, I have the EXACT SAME Fossil Grant Automatic you have in your post. I recommend not getting it. I\\'ve had that watch for almost a year now (maybe a little over) and already the stem is not behaving correctly when I pull out for adjustment. The watch has also sporadically stopped ticking on me in the middle of the day for some reason that starts back up after shaking it, and that is an absolute no-no (there is no manual wind, so I can\\'t tell if it is just not wound or if it is a sticky gear). \\n\\nMy other issues with the watch is the 31/1 are too close to each other on the subdial to the point that it looks like 311 instead of a 31 and a 1 (notice online that the minute hand covers this part, I think that\\'s intentional). I still don\\'t know why the 4 o-clock is not IV instead of IIII (I think they did this for aesthetics, since there are (4) X numbers, (4) V numbers and (4) I numbers). Power reserve is supposed to be 36 hours, but it\\'s definitely shorter than that (unless it is a result of the random stopping like I mention above). Accuracy is probably -10 or so seconds a day when I first got it... not sure on the accuracy now.\\n\\nFor the price, I would definitely recommend a [Seiko SKX007](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/0b/d2/64/0bd264a82f14f943afa946a3fbbaa824.jpg) or an [Orient Mako](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0153/3399/files/Orient_mako_darkbrown_vintage_leather_strap_1_grande.jpg?1556) with a leather strap (though admittedly, those are a different style)... the quality/build of just holding these watches compared to the Fossil is easily distinguished. \\n\\nIf you really like the Fossil look, then check out the [Seiko SSA231K1](http://global.rakuten.com/en/store/bright/item/ssa231k1/), of which I think the Fossil is actually modeled after and is well within budget. The quality of the dial and print alone makes the Seiko stick out from the Fossil. Other options include the [Sea-Gull M186S](http://www.good-stuffs.com/Sea-Gull-M186S-Automatic-Designer-Watch-_p_21.html) and the [Classic Rodina](http://www.good-stuffs.com/Classic-Rodina-automatic-wrist-watch-OEM-by-Sea-Gull-ST17_p_156.html).\\n\\n, They created a size small! That\\'s the problem, it seems to be proportioned all wrong.\\n\\nHere\\'s a photo comparing the two sizes from the FtM Essentials product page for Pierre: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0161/4364/products/bigandlittlepierre2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1413243194, &gt;Yes, and what if your competition could update all their clients from one place. \\n\\nThey can!  have you setup or even looked at any of these other programs i have been mentioning?

I\\'m sure they\\'ll maintain pace well into the future.\\n\\n[why does reddit recommend legacy tech?](http://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/35ayl0/what_ecommerce_store_do_you_guys_use_and_would/)\\n\\n[webhostingtalk, pretty reliable viewpoint of the hosting industry, also recommends legacy tech](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1383880)\\n\\nAlso hasn\\'t Java been around just as long as PHP?  Doesn\\'t that make [java legacy tech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#JDK_Alpha_and_Beta_.281995.29) too?  Why [aren\\'t you](http://tryshoppe.com/) making a [AGPL ruby](http://www.piggybak.org/) on rails [ecommerce platform](http://code.google.com/p/substruct/)?\\n\\n[looks like i am not along in suggesting legacy tech](http://www.quora.com/Which-one-is-better-%E2%80%94-PHP-or-Ruby-on-Rails-for-an-ecommerce-start-up).  Do you even understand my viewpoint?  It is great that you are creating personal pet projects, that is awesome. I am not stopping you from doing that.  I am helping you prevent your delusion from turning into a costly mistake.  If you are approaching this as a personal project, **ignore everything i have said**, keep trucking down that route.  It will be a great opencart or woocommerce replacement for mom and pop shops.  If you are trying to make a business out of it to replace or even compete with eg sales force, shopify, or magento, then you really  need to sit back and come up with more than just a licensing scheme but also business plan, revenue and cost estimates, and contracts.  Best of luck, let me know how I can provide more guidance if you choose to monetize your platform (because remember it makes no sense to monetize your platform if your goal is to only break even or worse lose money!!!).\\n\\n&gt;I built my stuff specifically because of how much of a burden your business model is. I can give websites AND apps, at 1/1000th the effort of most of those solutions. You could have a website and app tied to it, both customized, in a hour. I could improve your app and your website for you, in the background, centralized on the platform. Updates to the apps and libraries automatically yield new versions for a\\n\\nBack this up with numbers buddy, even appromixations.  1/1000th means your costs are $.005 per user per month (assuming my cost basis is $5/user/month).  See how you are the one making contridicting nonsensical posts?, [This one is nice, I could see something similar working](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0216/7184/files/M408-40-Full.jpg?8257574993198268543)\\n\\n[And I really like this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0216/7184/files/M425-41-Full.jpg?8257574993198268543) but I think it\\'d be too much. , You do realize magento is also multi-domain and offers SaaS as well?   Why do you dismiss this fact?\\n\\nThen you mention Java 8 as if it\\'s not based on it\\'s roots from 1996 Java.  Upcoming PHP 7 is light years beyond php2 for example.  Why do you dismiss this fact?  You can\\'t even explain what makes PHP legacy and why Java is not (even though it is from the exact same era).\\n\\nThen there is the fact that companies wish to use hosted platforms which give them features.  What features does your \"multi domain saas\" approach give you that is differnt from Shopify? Different from Magento saas?  Why do you dismiss these questions?\\n\\nHave you looked at magento ce\\'s code base?  It also has unit testing, offers suggestions for integration testing (which we utilize using puppet enterprise), it also has analytics to provide realtime suggestions and reporting capabilities, alerts on those reports, exporting to truely legacy POS systems (think NCR systems), live help from agents which can \"monitor\" your user sessions.  We are using this *today*.  Your shit is not out yet, as you say.  So what exactly is your platform bringing to the mix that is better than what we already have today?  AGPL?  We don\\'t benefit from AGPL, ergo we can continue to use Magento.\\n\\nIf you cannot answer my questions (seriously, just put them inline and reply directly to it) then no other company with any sort of real revenue projections will pay you any mind either... , Don\\'t bother with SEO. Just, please...focus on acquiring happy customers another way and making awesome products people love to share and you\\'ll do better than handing your money to a 3rd party. \\n\\nThat being said, that\\'s just SEO.\\n\\nSocial Media Management is a different beast. While not traditionally a conversion-based platform, it\\'s imperative for branding, engagement and customer service. This is a DAILY thing. If you\\'re unwilling to do it, hire it out. But, who can do it better than you? Hard to say. You have your best interests in mind and know what you want to do/share and the results you\\'re looking for.\\n\\nSame for content creation. If you can\\'t/don\\'t want to write, then you should consider outsourcing this. The good news is with a t-shirt business the \"content\" can be new shirt designs. Since it\\'s a crowdsourced approach to design it\\'s probably best that you just making sharing easy and allow people to post up their creations, essentially doing the marketing for you. \\n\\nI\\'d focus on FB first. Define your customer profile (demographics, interests) and try to get as many people as you can interested creating t-shirts and sharing with their friends. \\n\\nThere are a TON of resources online about this business, so Google is your friend if you\\'re looking for growth ideas. \\n\\n- http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/how-to/growth-strategies/2013/10/skreened-how-i-grew-a-t-shirt.html?page=all\\n\\n- https://www.shopify.com/blog/14515425-how-to-start-an-online-t-shirt-business-the-ultimate-guide\\n\\n- http://blog.unitedpixelworkers.com/2013/02/20/so-you-want-to-make-a-whole-bunch-of-t-shirts\\n\\n- http://olivergoodwin.com/case-study-teespring-broad-targeting-2k21days-facebook-hidden-interests/\\n\\n, [Enblue](http://enbluetec.myshopify.com/) has one that\\'s available for preorder.\\'\\n\\nEdit: I didn\\'t actually click that link you put there so didn\\'t realize it was the same thing I linked, but that\\'s an already funded kickstarter project.

I\\'d probably look at freelancers first and if you don\\'t like what they have to offer, move on to higher end local devs or agencies., Sounds like a PCI compliance nightmare to me. \\n\\nOP, use Shopify. , 1. your site is too slow.\\n2. not mobile friendly\\n3. a dog site without any pictures of dog?\\n4. why use background image that loads so slow?\\n\\nI would suggest using shopify (or other hosted ecommerce site). Also dog pics please. if you can get dog pics with those collars that would be even better., You can get them at at DBLiquids (http://dbliquids.myshopify.com/products/mast-mod-mini), but they don\\'t get restocked too often. , If you are looking for an E-commerce website, I recommend Prestashop (If working with developers). \\n\\n\\nShopify or Big Commerce are good choices if you wish to build your website yourself, as they are the easiest to setup and requires little to no coding. Do note they are platforms you will grow out of if you gain traction. Also, note that you do not own nor have access to your website\\'s database for these hosted solutions.\\n\\n\\nFor a leads capturing website, wordpress is the best solution by far. [This](http://casualfashionwholesale.com/) is one example I\\'m developing for a client.\\n\\n\\nIn your shoes, I would look for a local freelancer who knows their game and takes time to understand your business and goals. A good site is worth the little extra in the long run., https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0167/1606/products/Silika_Glass_Titanium_Grade_2_Scoop_Dabber_-2.jpg?v=1380989529\\n\\nPendant would be sweet., I\\'d definitely reccomend checking out the [Seiko SARB033](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0243/0993/products/s_sarb033h_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1372736278).\\n\\nIt\\'s a very high quality watch for under $400. Sapphire crystal, 6r15 automatic movement with hacking and hand-winding, and just an overall fantastic quality watch for the price, that\\'s very similar in style to that TAG.\\n\\nIMO if he likes the Carrera, you can\\'t really go wrong with this. You can pick it up from Seiya right now for $335 [here](http://www.seiyajapan.com/products/s-sarb033).\\n\\nHope this helps!\\n\\nEdit: A bit cheaper actually on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-MECHANICAL-SARB033-Wrist-Watch/dp/B001AE9XRQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431673127&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sarb033), and with Prime benefits., It\\'s a little bit confusing what exactly you offer. That needs to be loud and clear, in big and bold, as soon as I load your website. Only THEN will I decide, as a visitor, whether I need to look through your products or not.\\n\\nAlso, not sure why the word \\'Frontpage\\' is there. And the line:\\n\\'To edit the content on this page, go to the Pages section of your Shopify admin.\\' should definitely not be visible anywhere.\\n\\nTwo issues with the social media icons:\\n1. They link to the official Shopify twitter and facebook accounts, not yours.\\n2. The links (once corrected) should open up in a new window, not in the same one, otherwise people will be very easily steered away from your site,, What is shopify? Are these just for digital goods?, If I were in your position I\\'d go with shopify.\\n\\nIt will be very simple and easy to set up. Wordpress with woocommerce will be too much to add to your plate right now., It really just depends on what your trying to do with the website.\\n\\nDo you just want to have an online presence - some sort of personal page that is beautiful and simple and describes you in a more asthetically pleasing way than a linkedin profile?  I would go with about.me for this\\n\\nAre you an artist or musician type who is looking to promote your latest creative project?  I would go with squarespace.com\\n\\nAre you an aspiring blogger/writer/content creator just dying to share your thoughts with the world?  I would go with wordpress.org \\n\\nAre you trying to start an online store?  I would go with Shopify (but I hear BigCommerce is good too - I use Shopify).\\n\\nFor each of the above you will have the option of selecting free vs. paid themes.  At this stage you should again think about what you want out of your site - and evaluate your design/web dev skill set - and think about how valuable your time is to you - and then make your choice.\\n\\nMost free themes will have less built in options for customization and so will require more coding to get the design you want.  Most premium themes have more \"non-coding\" customization options available (that\\'s one of the reasons they are paid vs. free).\\n\\nIf you ever find yourself spending hours on the website doing work that comes out shitty because you don\\'t have the necessary skills/experience to do a good job - and you could have been building or shipping product, doing PR/Marketing, or anything else where your time would be better spent - you might want to seriously consider hiring a designer and/or developer to help you with the site. \\n\\nA few design / web dev tools to help you get started once you set up your website:\\n\\n1. 99 designs - really cool design marketplace where designers submit ideas for your project and you get to pick which one you like the most\\n\\n2. Sumo.me - really good conversion tracking, newsletter signup, and website optimization/promotion tools\\n\\n3. Themeforest - wordpress\\' theme marketplace., You\\'re not crazy.  This has existed!  [Proof](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/1762/products/12_7up_cranberry1_medium.gif?v=1230848153), Don\\'t have such broad topics.  When everyone is your listener, no one is your listener. , are you using shopify?, That\\'s fine if you want to treat your podcast like a place for you to express any and all thoughts, but it\\'s not going to help you grow your audience.\\n\\nThis goes for podcasting or growing an audience in any medium (blogging for example).  If you don\\'t niche down until it hurts, you\\'ll wallow with 20 listeners forever.\\n\\nHow many websites do you visit that don\\'t have any clear topic?  Unless you\\'re in the top .01% of people that can make anything interesting you\\'re going to be swimming against the current unless you niche down and pick just 1 topic., No such thing as too niche because you can always expand if you feel like you\\'ve hit a cap. \\n\\nI would pick a niche that you can think of at least 6 months of podcast episodes.\\n\\nYou also need to publish consistently (once a week at least)., I recently switched to Avision Ahead Elite fishbowl (https://hockeyfaceshields-com.myshopify.com/products/avision-ahead-elite-sr-mask). Visibility is great, lighweight, no fogging., [I think all of the pictures are the best](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0228/9021/t/13/assets/slideshow_5.jpg?7157778969859003486), 1. Decide on your budget. I can\\'t stress this enough. Having a budget will help with a couple of things:\\n a. Determines your platform (wordpress with Paypal buttons, Shopify, semi-custom or custom build).\\n b. Helps your developer determine the best solution for you, which can include initial setup/build fee, monthly hosting and email cost, maintenance fee, SSL fees, PCI compliance fees, Transaction and Payment gateway fees etc. Your budget should also include photography and web copy.\\n\\n2. Decide on a  deadline. If you have a short deadline you might need to go with an out of the box solution, like Shopify. If you have some more time you might be able to get something a little more custom. A deadline will also help a dev determine whether they can meet your need. A proper e-commerce site has a lot of little bits and pieces that happen in the backend that take time to setup properly.\\n\\n3. There are dozens of e-commerce solutions and if you\\'re working with a dev he\\'ll most likely steer you toward the solution he\\'s most comfortable with. If you have a preference, find a dev who specializes in that solution, you\\'ll get a better end product and it will take less time.\\n\\n4. Don\\'t forget, the launch of a website is not where it ends either. A website is not how people hear about your business, it is your business. Advertising and marketing is how people find out about it. Make sure to have a budget and a plan for that., They are also known as diffraction glasses - they make light look like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=diffraction+glasses&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=740&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iQxWVarHJPeKsQTlqYCYDQ&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg#imgrc=HUzr2DW5Q7KBnM%253A%3Bvj4VU3kyMcfimM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fcdn.shopify.com%252Fs%252Ffiles%252F1%252F0109%252F4872%252Fproducts%252Finclub-imp_ead4e63d-b11d-4145-b113-eb3b162e8ffe_1024x1024.jpg%253Fv%253D1378955969%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.eyeloveshadez.com%252Fproducts%252Fdiffraction-glasses%3B657%3B445), I agree you have to be PCI compliant, but it\\'s not impossible to be come PCI compliant.  Using Stripe helps alleviate a lot of the concern over PCI because you\\'re not storing card data on your own servers.  \\n  \\nI haven\\'t used Shopify or looked into it.  I\\'ll take a look.  I was recommending what I was familiar with is all.  To each their own.  Have a great day., Inkfrog. Gives you free customizeable templates, as well as lots of other customization. \\n\\nI mainly started using it because I have website that runs on shopify and it automatically syncs all my listings and other data. Definitely a huge help., Well right now I\\'m using Shopify and there are several downsides. I\\'m planning on building my own solution, but while the rest of the site is being built I need to come up with a solution for DIM shipping. I was going to create my own API, but I\\'m interested in other options if it will save me time(it\\'s a big enough of a problem that I need it fixed). What is the solution you are thinking of?, You mean [this](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0248/1535/products/skol_vodka_375_1024x1024.jpg?v=1381277215)?, I\\'m a HUGE fan of the brand...my white Biotrainers are my favorite pair of shoes, and they\\'re also the pair that got me into high-end footwear.

I\\'ve got a bunch of questions...answer however many you want.    \\n1. Could you explain what \"Semi-Cordovan\" means? You described the leather on your newest Biotrainers this way.

To my knowledge, you\\'ve only done one collaboration so far - the Outlier Supermarines. Are you looking to do any collabs in the future?  \\n5. How have your sales, and your business in general, been affected by the recent increase in interest in high-end sneakers?  \\n6. Are there any designs you guys have tried to make, but struggled with so far? Were any of the current models harder to pull off than expected?  \\n7. You guys seem to have had a pretty huge spike in publicity and coverage in the last 9 months or so. Was there a single event that was really a step-change for you guys, or is it just the end result of a gradual buildup? Have any particular publications or people really helped spread the word of FEIT?  \\n  \\nThanks, guys. Keep doin what you\\'re doin., What is it about female sexuality that makes it a one of a kind issue? Sex isn\\'t anything special, and females aren\\'t anything special, normal rules and logic apply to them. If I don\\'t want my fiancée to walk out in a g-string and she doesn\\'t want me wearing [pizza flip-flops](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0228/8535/products/AOPFF0175UAPT_Pizza_Mockup_1024x1024.jpg?v=1424891015), then the opinions, and the authority attached to both of those opinions, are equally worthy, or else my couple wouldn\\'t be worth giving a damn about anyways., No, they do not recruit here.\\n\\nMy brother goes to this school (third year SE) and he said they don\\'t come to the career fairs.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a fresh grad, the school you went to is definitely a stepping stone into the industry. Of course relevant experience + projects trumps it, but it is still a better starting point.\\n\\nYes. I am going to be starting school and I\\'ll be switching universities after my first year. I have a lot of friends who are doing CS/CE/SE at Carleton, and some at OttawaU, and they are nowhere near as successful as UW &amp; UT students. They all landed jobs at hip companies like sqaure as freshmans. My brother, third year SE has two extremely successful apps in the app store, 4+ stars. Thousands of downloads. High GPA, between A- and A. Bright student and a extremely active github with over 350 contributions. He didn\\'t get a Job at shopify at the final rounds of interviews. But woah, 3 weeks later all I see my freshman friend at [good school] post \"looking forward to work at shopify\". I asked for his resume, and he gave it to me. He had 1 more project, and knew a couple more non-industry languages, and of course the school name. His projects were definitely complex, however still close as my brothers. This is definitely understandable as he was a freshman, however that\\'s pretty much how it went. Same position, location, company., Even with a plug-and-play kind of platform, such as Shopify or WordPress with WooCommerce (which isn\\'t quite plug and play, but it\\'s as close as you can get without getting into full custom development), $800 is incredibly low for getting an ecomm site started. With the customizations you need, you really need to reconsider your budget, but as you\\'ve said elsewhere, anything more and you\\'re just not into it.\\n\\nMaybe this isn\\'t the place for these kinds of suggestions, but maybe instead you add your product offerings in menu form on your site (with prices) and start it off as a call-in delivery service. A little old school, sure, but you can gauge interest this way without the high startup cost of development. You can have people pay over the phone and if they can\\'t provide ID upon delivery, cancel the order as you would through your point of sale system OR take payments on-site with a PayPal or Square reader. \\n\\nIf the latter is of interest, do put some money into SEO/SEM and add delivery to your Yelp tags., I own a bunch of linen pants and love them for summer. here\\'s some pics (most not of me):\\n\\n* [1](http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/1000x1000/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/w/h/white_sal_pants.jpg)\\n* [2](http://cdn.styleforum.net/a/ae/900x900px-LL-aeb1b22f_tumblr_ncheivrCjJ1s3fb0mo1_1280.jpeg)\\n* [3](http://40.media.tumblr.com/bf03c07f43b1c6555c3202dd5bcf20b6/tumblr_n4m02gTgxo1qa2j8co1_500.jpg)\\n* [4](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0275/9117/products/GENTRY-NYC-OUR-LEGACY-RELAXED-TROUSERS-CHARCOAL-LINEN-15512_grande.jpg?v=1428429378)\\n* [5](http://i.imgur.com/eCmfubm.png) (this one\\'s me.), [*Wow*](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0358/2273/products/dogewow_grande.jpg?v=1393011138), yes!

Some of his pieces can still be purchased here: http://spoke-art.myshopify.com/collections/vendors?q=Tim+Doyle\\n, [deleted], Hi there! Sorry that people have given you a hard time before, that kind of sucks. Let\\'s take a look together, shall we?\\n\\n* I feel like your site is a bit washed out; the white on white on white is very stark and could use some colour. Also: your prices are light grey on white, I can\\'t really read them. \\n* I could use a bit of a welcome message, something to introduce me to your brand and help guide me around your site. It may sound a bit silly, but I enjoy knowing something about the company I\\'m buying from, it helps me connect with the brand.\\n* The mix of professional photography (climbing saddle) with what looks like iPhone photography (sorry, not meant to be rude - on the green teeth stump ginder teeth) is a bit disconcerting - maybe choosing a theme that has a border around the images will help ground them - or throw a border on your images.\\n* This is a common one for shopify - not all your images are the same size, so it leads to a size that feels disjointed. Take some time to edit the images so that they appear uniform in size. Same goes for your logos. \\n* \"Shop this collection\" is a bit vague; I know your audience is probably familiar with these brands but \"Shop for Rope\" \"Shope for Pruners and Saws\" helps SEO and is more descriptive\\n* Consider some content marketing stuff. A video can be a *huge* help as it really shows that you\\'re more than a fly-by-night. Videos or blogs (they don\\'t have to be long or expensive) can prove your expertise. Even short (and honest) reviews of products can go a long way. Take a look at one of your pruners - what do you love about it? What should people know about it that might be a concern? Don\\'t be salesy, be an expert.\\n* Your content on product detail pages is generally good, but it\\'s copy-pasta from the manufacturer\\'s website which is killing your SEO; Google sees it as copy-pasta and thinks you have nothing to add. This part sucks: re-write the copy yourself. Put your brand spin on it, offer insight, and create a table on relevant pages to show features (Rope, for example could have a table that shows length, tensile strength, colour, etc). \\n\\nGive people a reason to buy from you. Whether that\\'s selection, curation, expertise, price–you need a compelling reason. I feel like expertise and content is what could set you aside: if you know your shit there\\'s no reason why you should show your customer base that you know your shit. \\n\\nYou don\\'t have a strong call to action on any of these items that I can see. The free shipping offer might be good to call out (also, stupid but try writing Free Shipping as FREE shipping - it\\'s mental but I worked for a large scale retailer where we did AB testing and this actually had a huge impact).\\n\\nFinally, I\\'d suggest engaging a designer or taking a bit more time to think about the look and feel. The logo is nice, but it\\'s suffering from Low-Res sickness (there are jagged edges) and it shrinks to a really tiny size when viewed on mobile. Your colours, likewise, don\\'t leave me with any feeling about your brand, which is almost worse than having a bad feeling about it. The font is thin and hard to read on my laptop screen, and it feels a bit generic. \\n\\nCheck out http://irheating.ca - I did the design overhaul for this site in September; put in a new slider for them with new graphics, wrote most of the blog content from then onwards, and did three out of the four videos on the front page. Traffic shot up from SEO and sales shot up thanks to traffic. \\n\\nLast but not least: your site doesn\\'t suck, but it\\'s not finished. It may not ever be finished - that\\'s ecommerce for you. If you\\'re feeling lost or overwhelmed find someone like me who\\'s willing to project manage a design and content roll-out and git\\'r\\'done. \\n\\nHave a nice day, good luck, and go fell some trees or something. , [Tropical Punch!](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0189/9806/products/Tropical_Punch_350x350_large.jpg?v=1351459106) Actually pretty mildly flavored (not gross and overbearing) and... surprisingly tasty. I\\'d absolutely drink punch that tasted like that., This is all excellent advice., It was an early 70s Fender Musicmaster, short scale, with one single guitar pickup. i stupidly donated it to the school I was at. sigh, you always make a mistake like that somewhere along the way. Looked like this: http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0332/7621/products/4_7daf42ad-46ff-4996-bf3c-51a28be73d48.jpg?v=1402352021, &gt; I think it\\'s a good idea to donate the proceeds to his campaign.\\n\\nI think I\\'d go as far to offer that entire orders containing this proposed shirt will have profits go to him (edit: except for maybe our licensed designs, they get costly).\\n\\n&gt;If people don\\'t trust you to give away the proceeds that could serve as a problem\\n\\nI think I have enough track record for this and suggest checking out our blog to learn more about what I stand for and who we are. That said, I would be as transparent as possible. My previous startup was in bitcoin, so I have ideas on how to do that. I could probably have Shopify itself verify the amounts.\\n\\nJust a note on the \\'design\\' it truly could be ANYTHING. I would like it to be either really catchy for millennials and/or be really patriotic / to the point. If it\\'s really cool I would see if Bernie\\'s team would want it to be more of an official thing.\\n\\nOn the amount per shirt proposed to him, I would also be transparent w/ my costs to actually manufacture so you know exactly how much goes to him. Also, I would want your feedback on price point (given those costs) so we maximize how much is raised., Or maybe the brother did fine on the interview/coding, they just thought the other guy would be a better fit personality-wise. Or one of those \"non-industry languages\" the other guy knows that the brother doesn\\'t is Ruby. Lot of reasons someone might get a job over someone else that have nothing to do with what school they went to. Shopify hires plenty of Carleton students., I have only reddit to thank. I don\\'t really know anyone who vapes, so I learned here. I mostly lurked and read about gear and then how to build coils, wick, etc. It\\'s actually better for me to see dissenting opinions on subjective issues-- because I don\\'t have a local authority to turn to... I can consider different aspects of choices and determine what I might prefer. IOW, I can\\'t attribute this to any particular individual. Am slowly converting friends and relatives... so I suppose I am a bit of a \"patient zero\" -- and [don\\'t know if this matters to you, but the link provided above upset chrome, about the cert because of the myshopify redirect-- could scare off some people] -- that said, I like your selections-- something for everyone... happy birthday!!, I thought of that too. We\\'re different than what he would normally do for two reasons:\\n\\n1. We use a printing method that vaporized ink directly into the shirt so it can be all-over, high rez, etc. Screen print normally has only a few colors and is printed ~the chest area. [Here\\'s an example of that](https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/s306x306/e15/10784932_492302980912399_413300675_n.jpg).\\n\\n2. We are a user-submitted design platform (community crowd sourced) so the design may end up being really awesome.\\n\\nI\\'d absolutely *love* to work with his team directly but that\\'s getting ahead of myself. This type of thing is out of our normal scope / niche but I want this guy to be our next president.\\n\\nEDIT: I\\'d probably make a specific shopify store for this separate from mine. It\\'d be easier to be transparent and I wouldn\\'t need to associate him with our more controversial stuff. If I did that, I could even give mods here access to see the sales. I wouldn\\'t mind paying for it as long as contribution from sales was greater than what I could personally continue to donate anyways.\\n\\nBottom line... this guy needs our help to finance his election. If people here like what I am proposing, I\\'ll contact the mods next about potential next steps.\\n\\nEDIT2: I just thought as well, I want to make this about him not me. So, if this specific post gains traction and I contact the mods, I promise not to affiliate / link my website to this project again., [It\\'s not a random number](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0164/8082/files/Combine_Hand_Start_v_FAT_Start_40_yard_dash_Analysis_Paper.pdf)\\n\\nAlso, there haven\\'t really been that many players that were both stronger and faster than Bo. There have been some that were stronger and some that were faster, but very few that were both., Thanks for the reply. You\\'ve mentioned a really good advice on that U LEDs. I did not know about that. As for the PP, the limited slip was the only thing I regret not getting, but as you pointed out, I won\\'t be racing (doing a lot of canyon runs in the future, though). \\n\\nAs for stage 1 companies. Unfortunately, the closest unitronic dealer is 1:30-2 hours away which isn\\'t really that bad considering I\\'m in LA and it takes about an hour to get to anywhere. But when something happens to my car and I need to tow it back to reflash is back to stock which would be a hassle. Only APR dealers are close to where I live. Is unitronic like APR or is it like Eurodyne where you would only need to buy the tune and you can flash it yourself?\\n\\nBut I heard only good things about Unitronic when compared against APR for the MK7s so that might be where I will be headed.

It has some rocker and moderate W-concave, and some wheel flares too.  It\\'s plenty stiff, and does a decent job of vibration dampening to boot.  The only issue is, it\\'s quite expensive.  It\\'s $200 right off the bat, just for the deck.  If you have tons of disposable income and want to put it towards this particular board, far be it from me to stop you.  You\\'ll certainly have a deck that is very competent for fast freeride and DH.  However, there are a number of other boards with similar features which are equally well suited for high speeds, but for up to $125 cheaper.  Boards like: [Nelson Stingray DH](http://nelsonlongboards.com/collections/boards/products/stingray-dh), Bombsquad [Kula Pro](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/58791/bombsquad-kula-pro-model-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip) and [Agent Mini](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/29281/bombsquad-agent-mini-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip), Earthwing [Hoopty 34](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/59131/earthwing-2014-hoopty-34-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip) and [Hoopty 36](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/59141/earthwing-2014-hoopty-36-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip), Jet [Peanut](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/58051/jet-2014-peanut-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip) and [Tomahawk Rocker](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/decks/54721/jet-2014-tomahawk-rocker-longboard-skateboard-deck-w-grip), [Omen Buzzkill](http://www.omenlongboards.com/collections/frontpage/products/buzzkill), [Pantheon Harbinger](http://pantheonlongboards.myshopify.com/products/holiday-special-deck), and any number of [Rayne decks](http://www.raynelongboards.com/component/com_rokecwid/Itemid,122/view,ecwid/).

If you haven\\'t already, reach out to local businesses in your area. For ecommerce SMBs, I\\'d find related forums (think Shopify, Squarespace, Magento) and reach out to people directly who\\'d find value in your offering. \\n\\nOnce you have strategies for these cohorts, target them accordingly based on the information you can get (email, sales call, linkedin, facebook). You can easily scrape local listings for brick and motor establishments or use sites like builtwith.com to find sites powered by specific ecommerce platforms.\\n, [deleted], My time to shine!\\n\\n[An official Disney blog published a diagram of Princess Anna stating her hair colour is strawberry blonde with a white streak.](http://blogs.disney.com/disney-style/fashion/2014/03/13/anatomy-of-a-disney-characters-style-frozen-edition/)\\n\\nThere\\'s quite some dissonance about what is strawberry blonde, which I believe the dispute could erupt to the intensity of [another colour debate a few months back](http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Untitled-12.jpg).

Or he was blasted on drugs throughout the job fair and didn\\'t notice the MSFT or GOOG people there. Or he is lying to you about having gone to the career fair.\\n\\nFrankly if your brother is anything like you he is probably a heavily autistic douchebag of the look-at-me-I-know-everything variety who spews bullshit and nobody wants to work with him. That is probably why he didn\\'t get the Shopify job. \\n\\nPlus it doesn\\'t take a good developer to have apps with downloads.

A decent site build and say, 2 years of hosting with someone like shopify would come to right about that.  But some of that other stuff will cost you a lot more. Say, national expansion &amp; being on the shelves of major retailers.

There\\'s an enourmous amount of things to account for which you might not notice until you\\'re already months into developing.\\n\\nCondorr__, If you really want to roll your own on top of a framework, Googling found this generic python e-commerce framework but I don\\'t see any demos. http://satchless.com/, [Zooshoo!](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0434/3957/products/dale05blackpu-6_large.jpeg?v=1425998021) Really inexpensive.\\n\\nEdit.

I agree that our app isn\\'t meant to be used for stores that sell low price products. It depends on the type of product, price (I recommend above $20 minimum), and profit margin.\\n\\nRegarding the user credit: when a customer uses the Coopt share feature, our system authenticates and approves that the post went live on their Facebook status. Then, if/when they make a purchase, Coopt applies an automatic partial refund through the Shopify checkout system for the amount you set in your Coopt Dashboard. Absolutely no work is needed on the merchant end.\\n\\nWe do not use coupon codes because it creates another step in the checkout process and also for the merchant (to generate/manage the codes), and we make sure the entire process takes around 5 seconds to complete on the customers end.\\n\\nDoes this help answer your question?, [Vans Vault OG Style 36 Lx](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0213/8502/products/vans-og-style-36-stv-navy_1024x1024.jpg?v=1424933881)\\n\\nI realized I included the wrong link.

Then go to the IRS website for your EIN, With your EIN you can open a bank account for your LLC.\\n\\nSee if Shopify has default privacy notices and terms of use for your website. Otherwise, most people just borrow them from a similar site and edit as appropriate.\\n\\nOr you could pay someone a few grand to do it all for you., Wow. That is an extremely large room.

Those people can\\'t really handle getting a merchant account, let alone the integration. Also, it is really the only way to handle ebay sales. \\n\\nI am a developer who has written custom payment solutions based on AuthorizeNet and Stripe, and have worked with NMI and others for shopping cart modules. Stripe is by far the best to work with as a developer, but paypal is the easiest for that person who\\'s nephew or niece designed their ma and pa shop, or that person who is an ebay power seller.\\n\\nYes, it is a relic of the 90s, but they are literally the only practical way to sell on ebay and one of the few ways that lets people who know nothing about API keys and merchant accounts sell things on the site they already have. It is part of the reason I recommend places like Big Cartel or Shopify if someone is looking to start their site from scratch on the cheap. , Teespring.com will allow you to list them. They do all the work taking order and printing, you receive the margin. You can setup your own drop ship system too using the likes of shopify and a plugin for printaura, printful, or merchify. Those plugins are companies that do all the fulfillment for you. The latter method requires you to create and brand a website though., &gt; Yeah, an alternative there\\'s not much reason not too, apart from the hassle of it all, and the fact there\\'s no point. \\n\\nSometime payment processors have the option of bitcoin like Shopify. Enabling that shouldn\\'t be too much of a hassle.\\n\\n&gt; I don\\'t know any legal market where all customers would prefer BTC either, or even majority.\\n\\nExcluding illegal markets is excluding a large chuck of the market. Even so, some legal markets still prefer bitcoin. Amagi metals was doing a lot of sales in bitcoin in 2013. Some gambling sites accept bitcoin exclusively. Gambling isn\\'t illegal in many places. VPN providers often accept bitcoin although I don\\'t know how much of the sales comes from bitcoin. VPNs are not illegal.\\n\\n&gt; If you don\\'t have access to a bank account, why should anyone want to do business with you.\\n\\nMaybe you are too young to get a bank account. Maybe you don\\'t want to keep your money in a bank. Why would you want to exclude customers just because they don\\'t have a bank account?\\n\\n&gt; BTC is not attractive for international, because you have to buy BTC in order to do that, and buying $300 in BTC, will cost around $320 in my experience. You can make international transfers with many companies for next to nothing. https://transferwise.com/ is 1 of those.\\n\\nThat\\'s a nice service https://transferwise.com/ is offering. I\\'ve never heard of that before. You can buy bitcoins at \"next to nothing\" markup if you buy from Coinbase. I\\'m in the US. Here, every wire transfer I have heard of costs between $10 to $50. The delay can be up to 3 days too.\\n\\nIt is true that bitcoins are often marked up when buying, but you can also sometimes get some of the value back when selling into your local currency. Here we have locals who offer 105% for each bitcoin.\\n\\n&gt; It won\\'t become more popular, it passed that point a long time ago in my opinion, as is reflected in the value.\\n\\nWhy won\\'t bitcoin become more popular over time? The trend has been for it to be used more and more every year. Here is an example. http://blog.bitpay.com/2014/12/09/bitcoin-black-friday-2014-recap.html Are you saying that this year the trend is going to stop?\\n\\n&gt; I meant it\\'s more like stock in the fact it\\'s not a currency. It doesn\\'t have a fixed value.\\n\\nNothing has a fixed value when compared to anything else. If you are saying bitcoin is volatile, then that is usually true. But very few things stay stable forever. Gold has probably had the most stable value for anything I can think of. Time will tell if bitcoin\\'s volatility is more like a stock or like gold.\\n, Better formatted here!\\n\\n[Dignitas](http://team-dignitas.net/shop/all/Clothing)\\n\\n[NiP](http://shop.eslgaming.com/collections/ninjas-in-pyjamas)\\n\\n[Cloud9](http://store.cloud9.gg/)\\n\\n[Liquid](http://www.teamliquid.net/store/)\\n\\n[Virtus.Pro](http://www.esportstore.com/t-shirts/virtuspro-1/player-jersey-2014-vp)\\n\\n[Fnatic](http://shop.fnatic.com/collections/clothing)\\n\\n[Titan](http://shop.eslgaming.com/products/titan-jersey?variant=680340026)\\n\\n[Na\\'Vi](http://navi-gaming.com/en/shop)\\n\\n[EnVy](http://store.teamenvyus.com/)\\n\\n[TSM ^^^^wonnered](http://solomidstore.myshopify.com/)\\n\\n[CLG](http://counter-logic-gaming-store.myshopify.com/)\\n\\n[Luminosity](http://gamersapparel.co.uk/esport-stores/luminosity)\\n\\n[Vox](http://gamersapparel.co.uk/esport-stores/voxeminor)\\n\\n[iBP](http://www.ibuypower.com/IBPStore/Apparel), [Meanwhile I\\'m just drifting through space](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0228/9021/products/800x800oxygenart.jpg?v=1383678204), I still don\\'t get who is doing this and why.

The actual underlying db schema isn\\'t super bad but the rest of the code is just straight up terrible. I actually ended up integrating both CodeIgniter and Grails on top of it to support the business needs instead of working in the OSC coal mine.\\n\\nFWIW, I\\'ve worked on about 6 Magento sites and Magento is a piece of shit too. Just not as bad as OSC. The Magento community is pretty bad at dealing with security problems, which really boils my blood. The big shoplift hack was basically a text book example of how not to deal with a RCE bug. That being said, it\\'s easy to get in to, and it\\'s easy to find developers who can work with it. Also there are lots of nice plugins that integrate with things like Bright Pearl and ShipStation which are really helpful. I do think that they really went down a bad architectural path though, and the code base is not very well thought out. It takes a lot of effort to do any sort of code work, unless you have OOTB modules that can do what you need.\\n\\nShopify is great if you can handle its limitations. I recently helped bring a guy from Shopify to Magento and his big gripe with Shopify was that it wouldn\\'t let his products have more than some really small number of customizable variations on a base SKU. He wanted to sell a widget, and he wanted customers to choose from options A, B, C, or D for part 1, options E, F, or G for part 2, etc... each with their own price point. Shopify let you do like 3 max I think. Shopify has an API you can work with, but I\\'m not sure what its limitations are (processing time, flow control, domain model modification, etc)., I bought this [Our Legacy SP Pullover](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0491/9773/products/Our-Legacy-05-02_b8fb99d1-cb95-4433-aebe-9303abafa85e.jpg?v=1427214994) on near impulse, which is not normal for me. Love affair went full-blown when I saw [texture](http://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn-fsg/unionmade/Images/Products/17155-D_1425335064.jpg)., :) I haven\\'t tried any other curry hot sauces that I can think of. It was what made Start! so interesting. I\\'m sure they\\'re out there though.\\n\\nMan, other sauces... I\\'ll stick to the sauces I\\'ve learned about from this sub. They\\'re all fantastic!\\n\\n[Yellowbird Sauce](https://yellowbirdsauce.com/) - I\\'ve only had the original hab version, but it\\'s a great all around sauce.\\n\\n[Lucky Dog Hot Sauces](https://lucky-dog-hot-sauce.myshopify.com/) - I\\'ve had three of them and they\\'re all wonderful.

It has that mapley sweetness that makes it pair with breakfast so well.\\n\\n[Secret Aardvark](http://www.secretaardvark.com/) - Again, I\\'ve only had the original hab version. A very different sauce with a lot of mustard to it. Another great all-around go to sauce.\\n\\nOne you\\'ll see a lot of people mentioning here is [PexPeppers.](https://www.pexpeppers.com/) Unfortunately, I was informed right before ordering some of these that I should probably finish some of the bottles I already have first. :) I\\'m rushing to do just that because I can\\'t wait to try some.\\n\\nI\\'ve ordered the majority of mine through [Heat Hot Sauce] (http://heathotsauce.com/) which is a fantastic company. Many of creators are heavily involved in this sub and incredibly helpful. I hope this helps and have fun!\\n\\n, I was kind of conflicted over whether or not to buy. I realized I had a shoe similar in color and material to the gumsole vans in [these nike frees](http://www.shoezoo.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/2056c3925ef7ac82992bf9e6a11c16f0/653468_100.jpg), and then I also have a white leather shoe with the green/white stan smiths. I also just bought a pair of [these orange air maxes](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0214/7974/products/Nike_Air_Max_Lunar90_WR_Sneaker_Politics_13_1024x1024.jpg?v=1412468309), but I may go back tomorrow and get the vans and then return whatever I don\\'t like when the air maxes come in. , Could you elaborate on what happened?  I\\'m thinking about moving my parents\\' site to Shopify but am worried about not having control over things like this., *-googles bits &amp; bites-* \\n\\nOh, you mean [Chex Mix](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0304/0365/products/HF15990_bcddd052-c59b-4078-89c4-735e732ba789_large.jpeg?v=1427343775).

[Scrump &amp; Dro](http://scrump-dro.myshopify.com/), One of my friends in-person is trans, and I\\'ve met trans people in my area before through a trans group, but I don\\'t really attend as much anymore. I don\\'t really hang around in trans/queer spaces irl, I usually don\\'t fit in even with other trans guys. Plus I think I\\'m at a certain point in my life where I\\'m kind of over attempting to help people just starting out since I can\\'t relate much, and I\\'ve dealt with some \"conflict\" with a lot of other guys.\\n\\nIn other news, I\\'m buying a new guitar tomorrow. :-D I\\'m really excited; my current guitar I\\'ve had since I was 15, and it\\'s time for an upgrade. I\\'m either getting [this](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0314/2129/products/thinlinenylon1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1429310883) or [this](http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjAwWDkwMA==/z/UxQAAMXQVT9S9Pko/$_32.JPG) (and I\\'m kind of undecided, I\\'m waiting on playing both in-store and choosing one based on the quality of its acoustics/sound.)\\n, a land whale\\n\\nedit:[hmm](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0537/4221/files/2d4_large.gif?325), I have one of those. In hindsight I should have gotten one of [these](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/2413/products/us_army_aviation_enlisted_branch_insignia_1438_avi_enl_bi_2_41ceaefd-ca43-427b-8bc2-186df597ebf5_grande.jpeg), I was a graphic design major in college. I wanted something really clever, that I\\'d never regret. I also wanted something that would never ever be on a redneck\\'s ass. (I was in WV at the time)\\n\\nSo here\\'s the story. Open up a beer carton or cereal box and you\\'ll see the print registration. [**example**](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/8372/products/tattly_yoko_sakao_ohama_crops_web_design_01_grande.jpg?v=1334958136)\\n\\nThese are essentially the colors used in printing the packaging, hidden off to the side so the printer can ensure that the colors are coming out right, and lined up.  My tattoo is  the four color squares and a cross-hairs. Those are the four colors needed for a photo...  this is the registry that would have been needed to \"print\" me.  \\n\\n\\nI got it on my upper arm, so if I wanted to show it to you, all I have to do is roll up my sleeve, but I don\\'t ever accidentally show it off. I was applying for jobs in 1999, and most graphic design workplaces were not entirely tattoo friendly at the time.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m in WV at a reputable ink shop, and I show my design to the artist. He tells me how much it would cost and to go wait in the waiting room. I\\'m sitting between two huge WV biker guys. (The guy on the left gets Tasmanian Devil on his calf.)\\n\\n\\nAbout 20 minutes later the artist comes out and says to the 3 of us\\n\"Which one of you guys wanted the gay flag?\"\\n\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m still happy I have it. For a period in my career I felt like I \"sold out\" and wasn\\'t doing graphic design for a living, and I actually felt good that I had that tattoo to remind me that I wasn\\'t a 100% corporate zombie. It\\'s fading a little, and I may eventually get it touched up a bit, but I love it.\\n\\nSide note. One of my hobbies right now is shooting concerts. I told my wife that if I ever get asked to go on tour with any of the bands, that I\\'m getting this [**sweet wrist tattoo**](http://www.tattoostime.com/images/375/awesome-grey-ink-fire-and-flame-tattoo-on-arm.jpg) (maybe get the drop shadow a bit softer) and I won\\'t ever give a fuck.

[here\\'s the image](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0398/2929/products/tugboat_zombie.JPG?v=1426379785), Originally set up the account and purchased the domain through Shopify on my college .edu email address, lost access to that address after I graduated and then switched the email address in my account.  For some reason, they had to verify my domain email address again recently, and they could only verify it through the original email address attached to the account.  Caused a huge hassle, and I ended up having to talk to their legal team to get the site back online.  , As much as I would like to say something bad about Shopify, what they did is pretty mush standard procedure in the industry., Just want go warn you against doing this. It severely hurts the SEO of your blog when it\\'s in a sub domain and not a sub folder. , nice\\n\\ndo you use shopify? or how did yo uset it all up, You can get pink pants from [Northside](https://northside-paintball.myshopify.com/products/syndicate-pants-pink), I\\'d stick to a Wordpress plugin instead of shopify.

But as per my personal experience best e-commerce platform is Shopify and in this video we have to compare the key element of any e-commerce platform which is required for comparing with another., http://promerch.com/collections/football (Let\\'s see if anybody notices a certain male model being used)\\n\\nhttp://sconnie.com/\\n\\nEdit: **Blue Steel** https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0581/9481/t/2/assets/aboutImg3.png, http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0650/6819/files/Screen_shot_2014-10-21_at_12.34.27_PM.png?691, I think that Node.js is a bad choice for a backend, one objective reason being that the language was forked, so I\\'m against 100% JavaScript. Even if I wasn\\'t, I think it would still be too difficult for one person, because those would again be 2 completely different ecosystems, only the language would be the same.\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you know how to write well-designed JavaScript (with no JS framework). I actually don\\'t think it\\'s difficult (you can just apply your Ruby design knowledge), it\\'s just that JS frameworks have dynamic templating much better solved than Rails with it\\'s f**king app/helpers. That\\'s a terrible design pattern, it\\'s insanely diffciult to design templates well in Rails.\\n\\nAnother thing is that other than JavaScript, you still have to learn the whole world of CSS. It\\'s very difficult to write CSS that works, and it\\'s essential to your product that your website is pretty, because the bar is high. I really don\\'t understand why is it so difficult to hire 2 people and manage them? Normally the other person should be much better and faster in frontend than a full-stack developer, because if they programmed for same amount of years the frontend developer should have twice as much experience. Where is the flaw in my logic?\\n\\nYes, I have seen DHH\\'s RailsConf presentation. As I remember, 3 things that he introduced was \"rails new my_app --api\", Turbolinks 3 and ActionCable. The first one doesn\\'t change anything practically (I can still just use \"rails-api new my_app\").\\nThe second, in general it\\'s insulting that DHH calls Turbolinks a JS framework. He said that for Shopify it worked better than their internal JS framework, Batman.js. I accidentally happened to have watched a talk before from a developer at Shopify, where he was describing how Batman.js was an absolutely terrible framework. DHH was so proud that Turbolinks worked better, but he only proved that Turbolinks is better than something terrible.\\nActionCable was honestly really difficult to follow. DHH said he made it simpler, but I didn\\'t really see it. It seemed to me that he just reinvented Faye\\'s channels. In general I didn\\'t see why I would want to use ActionCable rather than using Faye directly., http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0719/3571/files/ray_lookbook_peppermint_pomade_medium.png?17392527555975013538\\n\\nThat look would go really well on you.

What\\'s the value-add for me, as a provider?, check out printful or printaura\\n\\n[printaura](http://www.printaura.com/#_a_37) are a bit cheaper in my experience, both are almost identical quality wise. both have woocommerce and shopify apps so you can hook it all up so it just works automatically. \\n\\nyou aren\\'t going to make great profit margins, but you don\\'t have to handle stock, pay upfront etc. \\n\\n, Shopify, Shopify Pros:\\n\\n- It\\'s hosted by them and updated by them, so you don\\'t have to manage that\\n- Fairly simple to setup\\n- Fast, decent looking templates\\n\\nCons I\\'ve found:\\n\\n- Real time shipping isn\\'t incuded in the $29/month plan, but they might be able to throw it in if you ask nicely (otherwise it\\'s +$20/month).\\n- Have to use Shopify Payments (Stripe) unless you want to pay a 1% extra processing fee\\n- Templates are quite rigid - if you want to add in more custom fields it\\'s a pain in the butt and requires crazy plugins like ShopifyFD and Custom Fields in chrome\\n- You don\\'t control any of the code or databases, so any kind of custom code, discounts, shipping rules, etc aren\\'t really possible.\\n- No virtual terminal on the web for receiving payments over the phone.  You can use the iPhone app, but that\\'s a pain in the butt.\\n- Blog section has no categorization options.\\n- Cost of course:  At $29/month, you could otherwise host your own cart software (prestashop/magento/etc) on a $6/month shared hosting plan instead., One of Cinder\\'s poses in this drawing reminds me of her [voice actress\\' picture of her wearing this shirt](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0228/9021/products/3_beowolf_jess_large.jpg?v=1393346123) \\\\^_^, According to their blog, they switched over to 64 bit in May 2013:\\nhttp://www.shopify.ca/technology/7576902-api-announcement-shopifys-growing-and-so-are-our-integers, Shopify, or Squarespace.\\n\\nI use Shopify now and like it, have used Magento for the previous 4 years. Can\\'t imagine going back.\\n\\nHaven\\'t personally used Squarespace, but when I compared Shopify and Squarespace, I thought both looked good. I went with Shopify mostly because they are focused on just ecommerce. But I am contemplating setting up a client on squarespace for my next project., You can buy them in comic shops or digitally through Comixology.

If you ever need any help, don\\'t hesitate to get in touch :), This seems to be a global id for variants. You can see the real (above 2.4B) on your shopify admin panel when editing a variant. It seems to be 318M bad :(, I\\'m not familiar with Shopify\\'s API. Do you mind explaining what the variant_id is, and how its value relate to number of products?, Nope, only if you use a payment gateway other than shopify payments.  (Then it\\'s 1%)., Certainly!\\n\\nFrom what I understand, every product (think a t-shirt) has a unique ID across the system. My shirt has id #17, yours has id #28.\\n\\nNow, every variant (think sizes of a product. Ex: My t-shirt in Small) has an Id too. My t-shirt in small is #283, your t-shirt in small is #456.\\n\\nEvery time a new size of a product is created, it is attributed an id. This id is incremental, which means every time an ID is issued, the next ID to be issued is that ID + 1. \\n\\nNow, I see in my shopify admin panel, when editing a variant, what its ID is. (See [here](http://i.imgur.com/nDcvhFv.jpg))\\n\\nSince we can assume the id is incremental, we can simply calculate what the difference between that number and the  [maximum value of a signed int](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2147483647).\\n\\nWe arrive at ~318M in difference.\\n\\nI\\'m typing this on the go, sorry for any typos or formatting problems!, Right, I think it was like 1% / 0.5% and 0.3% before for any processor depending on which plan you had.  Not sure when they changed.\\n\\nAlso, assuming you trust Shopify Payments (Stripe), which was just bought by Paypal.\\n\\nHopefully Stripe doesn\\'t become as unseller-friendly as Paypal., &gt; We\\'ve completely removed the international shipping option from our site and work out a more exact shipping situation through other order methods. \\n\\nDo you mean you have removed the international shipping info from the site? Or that you have removed online ordering for international customers from the site?   \\n\\nBecause the info is still there - http://jaxxjuice.myshopify.com/pages/international-shipping\\n, http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0201/7102/products/C11.jpg?v=1378610176 maybe something like this!, [pulp](http://static.shopify.com/s/files/1/0001/1790/files/bwposesm.jpg?1266434372), My gut feeling is that your 90 percent of your buy flow is on your domain with a particular look and feel and then users are redirected to the **checkout.shopify.com** domain to complete the transaction on page (the UI) that doesn\\'t look the same.  The logo is missing and even the fonts / colors are different.\\n\\nFor users that don\\'t know any better they might feel like something is fishy and they abandon ship.  If you can i would try to make the checkout page (spotify) look as much like the main site as possible.  I wouldn\\'t waste money on adwords until this is fixed.\\n\\nGood luck!, I love Shopify because it is ecommerce first. How many SKUs, products, and/or variations do you currently have?\\n\\nWould you mind sharing your current site with us?, I don\\'t think Enter Sandman is poorly produced/mixed, nor do I really think the black album / metallica is poorly done (well, early metallica...)\\n\\n[Here](http://gyazo.com/cd32469a710b662bf767d335087997cc) is a zoomed in spectrum of Enter Sandman.  Where the cursor is is a section I want to highlight.  \\n\\nOne can see the bass notes very clearly down under 100Hz, and the sort of backwards L shapes have two components - the vertical part is the kick drum and the horizontal section is the lowest guitar string.  I hope that makes sense.  There are a set of larger horizontal bars which are the guitar chords.  \\n\\nSee how \"empty\" the spectrum is in between them?  The guitar has been scooped and the tone ripped up by a bunch of processing.  \\n\\nCompare that to [this](http://gyazo.com/17249f0f1294417796f047cc5e6f5cfc) song, Chronic by Leprous, and you can see that the guitar fills a much larger bandwidth.  \\n\\nEnter Sandman, or anything with that guitar tone, will hide dips/nulls/peaks or anything else funky going on in those lower mids where there is nothing but the drums living, whereas Chronic would make it clear with a strong change in guitar tonality.  If you listen to Chronic you can get the difference in guitar tone actually.  Leprous has filled out their guitar with processing and at about 2:45 a new movement of the song begins where the dry guitar is used instead of wet.  You\\'ll be able to hear the change in tone that I\\'m talking about.  \\n\\n----\\n\\nWhen I say \"audiophile fidelity\" I mean a few things;\\n\\n* flat frequency response without any local issues - PAs other than line arrays are usually tuned for an overall even frequency response without emphasis on \"local linearity\" because they get deployed in all sorts of different places and the room will change the sound enough for it to not matter too much.  ^1\\n\\n* fast transient response - the speaker can go from producing nothing to making a note to silence again in a specific amount of time - this determines the transient response (aka impulse response).  Consider that a cycle of a 1khz lasts only 1ms.  A 1kHz tone is usually what is used to measure transient response.  See an example [here](http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/ShureSE846WhiteFilterSample2.pdf) of a very good performance.  The driver goes from peak to trough in about 1/2 to 3/4 of a ms and then quickly damps down to more or less nothing.  [This](http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/VSonicGR07BassEdition.pdf) is a more typical and \"okay\" transient result, [this](http://www.innerfidelity.com/images/UltimateEarUE700.pdf) is a bad one.  An unclean transient hides details and directly correlates to the \"resolving power\" of the speaker.  ^2\\n\\n* coherent wavefront - this one is hard.  A line array component is designed to have a phenomenally coherent wavefront (see the LFC-1100 specs I posted above) where all frequencies are in phase with each other.  This is because you will get really bad comb filtering if a line array isn\\'t in phase and it will sound like ass everywhere, and have massive constructive/destructive interference nodes within the room (meaning you make some people deaf and the others hear nothing).  PA gear that isn\\'t designed to go in a line array is more concerned with getting one box **loud** so the tweeters are usually driven by some monstrous magnet and voice coil and then embedded deep in a horn for maximum efficiency and peak SPL capacity.  Then the driver is designed for strong excursion (this works against the transient response too) so as it plays it subtly phases in and out for the upper mids.  These phase swings hamper the imaging of the speaker, but live sound really has no concern for imaging and they aren\\'t designed to be deployed in arrays so it doesn\\'t matter.  \\n\\n^1 room modes are going to fuck up the lower mids and lows of anything unless you play in an acoustically nice room with well places speakers, so be cautious making judgements of speakers unless you listen to them outside in open air (which is going to roll off their bass compared to being in a room).  \\n\\n----\\n\\n[Here](http://line6.com/data/6/0a06434d11974f555a86a4cda/application/pdf/Line6%20L3t%20Specifications%20-%20English%20%28%20Rev%20A%20%29.pdf) are the measurements of the L3t - you can see scooped highs which is going to give them an un-monitor like character.  [Here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0201/8878/t/2/assets/Stealth8_Plot_Graph.pdf) is a measurement from Emotiva of their best monitor out to 500Hz.  You can see that it has no peaks or nulls unlike the L3t.  This isn\\'t a bad thing - peaks and nulls and stuff can sound good!  But it means the L3t is noticeably less accurate in that range than this monitor is.  \\n\\nThat Dynaudio is probably a nice sub.  Dynaudio has a good reputation for studio monitors and that\\'s part of their studio series so it should be pretty sweet.  The wattage is quite low for its price tag but since it\\'s all XLR in it\\'s looking for a 4 or 4.4V signal and amplifying that whereas e.g the SB-2000 is looking for 2-2.25V max and throwing out 500W rms.  If the voltage gain is the same in both subs the dynaudio actually has the capability to be a bit louder, but it\\'s more common for kilobucks range subs to carry 1kW rms outputs [like this](http://www.svsound.com/subwoofers/sealed-box/SB13-Ultra) [or this](http://www.svsound.com/subwoofers/ported-box/pb13-ultra) [or this](http://velodyne.com/subwoofers/digital-drive-plus-series/digital-drive-plus-18.html).  \\n\\nThe Dynaudio is probably a pretty nice sub, I would worry for its longevity as it gets beat up moving between gigs though.  In general a passive sub or something like QSC\\'s subs with casters on it is better for longevity.  \\n\\nAre you looking for XLR inputs specifically to be able to hook mic cables up directly?  You may be better served by a small board e.g an A&amp;H Zed10 and using the aux outs for a sub out and using the main outs for your tops.  \\n\\nI have not heard the stagesource series - here\\'s what I\\'ve mixed on:\\n\\n* QSC PLX3602, some shitty crown amps, Lab Gruppen FP4000 fleet and associated network controllers, etc\\n\\n* QSC K8, K10, K12\\n\\n* QSC K181w\\n\\n* JBL JRX 100s, JRX 200s, PRX 400s, SRX 700s, VRX 900s (both line array and wedges)\\n\\n* JBL VRX918, SRX718\\n\\n* Yamaha LS18\\n\\n* Meyer Leo system\\n\\n* Meyer LFC-1100\\n\\nThe biggest thing I ever did was shadow \"FOH engineer\" for an EDM show (~5-10k attendance) which is more aptly called \"the switch guy for the DJ and systems engineer.\"  We were flying the Leo system for that with a stack of 4+4+2 LFC-1100s per side to knock the stadium down.  We were hitting 32Hz synth drops at 110dB from the mix position which was a few hundred feet from the baracades, so probably close to 140dB nearfield.  Probably the most impressive and best sounding rig I\\'ll ever work with - when we were calibrating it we had perfect phase across the stadium from 30-20kHz and a +/- 1dB FR in that same bandwidth, and when it came to actually making music the Leo system just made it sound so effortless.  If we had a few more LFCs we probably could have gotten down into the mid 20Hz range with a fourth crossover but at show volume the limiters were kicking in when we tried to get to 28Hz.  The stack was 4x 100-60Hz 4x 60-35Hz 2x &lt;35Hz., Definitely second shopify.

There are a lot of really fantastic posters out there, but this one just hits the spot., Hi Dimeideas,\\n\\nI have used Shopify for the past few years, and I really love it. However, there are many reasons why you should use esell.io over Shopify or any other e-commerce solution.\\n\\n1. If you\\'re a small retailer who has 2-5 items for sale, opening a regular shop doesn\\'t make much sense. It takes time and an e-shop with three items looks just strange. \\n\\nAnd you wouldn\\'t open an e-shop if you want to sell your old bike. With esell.io all you need to do is snap a picture, price it and share the link on your facebook wall. Any of your friends can pay and buy it in 30s. \\n\\n2. If you have followers on your Pinterest account or readers on your Blog, you can sell your products directly there. You don\\'t need to add an external link to your shop. If all your potential customers gather in your blog, why would you be selling on some other page :)\\n\\n3. Adding links to your product page on let\\'s say Pinterest boards complicates the whole workflow. Just look at it - your user clicks on the product link, gets redirected to the product page, has to click \"add to cart\", gets redirected to the cart. If there is something else he or she wants to buy, we go again - Pinterest board, product page link, product page, add to cart, cart page and so on. Take a look at this demo store we set up with esell.io. I bet you\\'ll feel the difference: https://www.pinterest.com/esellio/pretty-little-things/\\n\\n4. We don\\'t have any monthly or setup fees. So if you don\\'t sell anything, you don\\'t pay anything. Whereas with Shopify or Big-commerce you pay every single month even if your business is just starting and getting 1-2 orders a month.\\n\\nEsell.io is not the best solution for huge online retailers. I agree with that. Though we have some big online shops that use esell.io for selling directly on their email marketing campaigns (yes, they actually sell on emails).\\n\\nWe\\'re creating a tool for artists, self-publishers, craftsmen solopreneurs, small event organisers and other creators, who want to sell something they create and want to do it in 30s.\\n\\nAndrius\\nCEO and Co-founder of esell.io, For the shipping would setting it to be weight based solve your problem? You would still need to set it up based on location but using something like the Shopify fd chrome plugin makes this relatively quick to do http://shopifyfd.com/ \\n\\nFor the quantity breaks, I can\\'t recommend the app enough as it does make life so much easier but if you really don\\'t want to use it you could maybe instead look at changing the product so that it\\'s sold in units of 10/20 etc. This way you\\'d have one variant set up for a single unit, then one set up for packs of 10, another for packs of 20 meaning you can have different prices for each and if someones wanting 40, they just order 2 packs of 20.\\n\\nThe only downside of this is that managing the inventory may get messy, ( there is an app that could help with that though that is cheaper than the quantity breaks https://apps.shopify.com/simplesync  ) and for people wanting to order odd numbers it may be a little more difficult (eg if someone wants 11 they\\'d either have to add 10 to the basket then another 1 or add 11 single produicts at the higher price. That said, it may also encourage people to buy more so it could work out better for you long term) , The big one that might be a good fit is LivingSocial - they tend to have a more active user base.\\n\\nA niched site is better than a general site, though, so I would take /u/turbospartan \\'s recommendation to try clymb.com.\\n\\nFinally, if you don\\'t mind a bit of extra work, you could set up a shopify site and give coupon codes to surf bloggers as a value-add for their users.  The users get cheaper clothes, you sell your inventory and the bloggers get an affiliate cut of the revenue.  This is potentially the most lucrative, but requires more legwork., Encontrei a Braintree que pertence à Paypal.\\n\\nAté 50 mil euros não cobram qualquer taxa e têm integração com o Shopify.\\nNo entanto pedem registo de empresa para validar a conta.\\n\\nA única vantagem que vejo em abrir empresa é possibilitar mais meios de pagamento.

Hope this helps, Start with Shopify IMMEDIATELY.\\n\\nWhy? Because Etsy has everybody and their grandmother selling the same thing you are for a lot less money, and if you happen to find something profitable, some overseas shop with low overhead will do something similar ASAP, now that Etsy\\'s changed the rules on who can be a member.\\n\\nWith your own domain on Shopify, you have your own brand, lower priced products aren\\'t right there sharing space on the screen with your product, and you have full control over every product on the site.\\n\\nEtsy is definitely easy, and pretty close to free, but it\\'s largely a waste of time as far as sales are concerned.

An auburn with lots of freckles or something. I tried to choose images of more natural looking red heads - though you can tell some of them have dye jobs done. One of my greatest pet peeves is when people dye their hair red and try to pull the, \"I\\'m such a redhead card.\" No. Just no. Unless you got called names and picked on, or actually had certain things happen to you because of your hair, or have certain side effects (sunburns, more anasthesia needed, more painkillers needed), then you\\'re not a real redhead.\\n\\n\\nFor some reason, I\\'ve had a lot of experience with fake redheads pulling this shit with me, and I don\\'t even pull that shit. I\\'ve only been fooled by fake red hair once in my life. I can just about always tell.

Set-up shopify and sell on etsy. I would do that. , To expand on that second con of having to use Shopify Payments-- it seems as though Paypal is the easiest payment processor for a lot of accounting systems like Wave and Xero because they treat Paypal as an account, and therefore you can automatically capture payment processing fees and account for them.  Otherwise, using Shopify Payments (or stripe or braintree, etc), you\\'re accounting system will only capture your revenue NET of fees, so you\\'re top line numbers will be understated.  \\n\\nUnless anyone\\'s found an AUTOMATED workaround for this, this is the sole reason we aren\\'t on Shopify-- for the sake of keeping our bookkeeping process clean and automated., In my experience, by far the best way to find the best restaurants/pubs etc in Ireland is word of mouth. Ask a local, a bartender, shopkeeper, tradesperson, etc. We\\'re a naturally talkative people. If you look online, you\\'ll just come across hip or touristy locations. \\n\\nAs regards what to see in Dublin, this question comes up daily on /r/Dublin and so look back through past answers, it\\'s pretty much all been covered.

For Cork, I\\'d try /r/Cork as there is a longstanding rivalry between the two cities.

If you have an idea, you can\\'t wait to do it. I launched my brand with two shirts and I begged all my friends to buy the day we picked up the shirts from the manufacturer. At this point, we didn\\'t even have our own website.\\n\\nI don\\'t think my brand is successful at all yet. There\\'s a lot of work to do to make better products, and to provide it at a cheaper cost to the customer.\\n\\n\\n* Was there anything that just fell into place or required an obscene amount of time more than you thought?\\n\\nNothing falls into place. The worst is having to deal with manufacturers. Maybe it\\'s just bad luck on my end, but 4 times out of 5, the order isn\\'t 100% completed at the deadline. Which ends up being a big waste of time. There was a 3 week period before my SS release where I had zero inventory.\\n\\n* Have you been able to establish relationships with your vendors?\\n\\nKinda. When I used blanks, I went into the same wholesaler so many times, they knew who I was. I don\\'t think my quantities were big enough to ask for a discount lol\\n\\n\\n* What did you expect? Did it match reality?\\n\\nDidn\\'t know what to expect. I knew I could market a streetwear brand and drive traffic to my store, just didn\\'t know if anyone would like the products.\\n\\n\\n* Did you start it on your own, or with a partner?\\n\\nYeah, I started it with a partner, he didn\\'t contribute much, so I bought his shares.\\n\\n\\n* What do you use to manage your business (Website/paypal/etc.)\\n\\nShopify does mostly what I need it to do.\\n\\n* What are your margins on just print shirts?\\n\\nScreenprinting shirts are where the money is made. You can buy a blank for $2, get a screen hit for $1 - $1.50. Of course there\\'s set up costs too: ~$25 per screen. Overall, very high margins from screenprinting on blanks\\n, Just to riff off of your comments\\n\\n1.  Momentum is everything.  Ideas are best executed when fresh.  Because you start doubting yourself and lose interest quickly.  Habitually leaving projects unfinished can become a disease if left untreated.  \\n\\n2.  If you think $30 a month for something like Shopify is too much for you.  Storeenvy is free if you bring your own traffic.   But they will take 10% of whatever you sell on their marketplace. There are other paid options out there too that are cheaper than Shopify.  But if you\\'re using Print on Demand your margins probably aren\\'t too great.  So covering cart fees sucks.\\n\\n3.

You have a pretty decent start at a website here, but your landing page needs some work. All it says is \"introducing simplicity\" with a shop now button. While I love simplistic layouts and anything that\\'s easy on the eyes - it doesn\\'t really draw anyone in and make them think \"gee, I bet these guys sell some pretty dope tee\\'s\" (or what have you..) - In fact, you have to scroll down to even find out that you\\'re a t-shirt company. This might be nit-picky, but I would suggest doing something to make your landing page a little more \"hey! we\\'re awesome, buy a shirt.\"\\n\\n2) You need more product and more product designs. You have a good start, but you don\\'t have a great deal of selection and you don\\'t really have anything that is eye popping.. and honestly, the pricing for what you offer isn\\'t that great. 20$ for a shirt that advertises your companies website? nah.. get some more designs and then people will justify spending the $$ for them.\\n\\n3) The facebook and twitter links direct to somewhere called shopify. Are you affiliated with them? I assume they\\'re probably generic redirects for the template that you are using.\\n\\n4) You should look into taking orders for t-shirts - I know plenty of places (such as the college) that buys tshirts for events.. and plenty of people that would love to get their stuff printed on shirts. Offering a service like that would probably bring in some decent business for you as well.\\n\\nAgain, hope it all works out for you, good luck! :), Couple of quick ways.  I have not used Shopify in quite a while, but I am sure that they have responsive templates that you can likely carry this over to.  You will, of course, have to make modifications but that is a small price to pay to do as Google says we should do (aren\\'t they the boss, after all??).  Secondly, there is likely a very quick way in Shopify to enable mobile commerce.  In 3dcart, this is an option that can be selected and you get a very fast loading, bare-bones mobile site that is really nothing more than your header and navigation.  It isn\\'t the prettiest thing, but it is effective and you can edit it however you\\'d like.  I don\\'t know for sure, but Shopify being one of the major cart providers should have something like this as well.  Perhaps a regular Shopify user can contribute further... , I actually pre ordered a pretty cool looking rda. I can\\'t say if it\\'s good or not , but I can say vls does put out quality products.\\n\\n\\nhttp://justvapeinc.myshopify.com/products/the-vector-rda-by-vls-vapourlifestyle, Heads up... nothing worse than having to click through to get a description of a juices flavour. When you get a chance I would make it a priority to fix that.\\n\\nShopify has a bunch of \"apps\" and one of them is called Product Customiser and is pretty good for lots of options. I use Shopify for my business and once you get it rolling it is excellent. If you need some help with it I know Shopify well enough to do simple quickly.\\n\\n\\nDo you use the higher end nicotine? That\\'s the one thing that stops me getting not so expensive juices... been put off by juice that\\'s rough on the lungs., Thanks! They do have plenty of responsive templates, and I\\'ve found one similar to what I\\'m using now, but it doesn\\'t look quite as clean, and I\\'d prefer to stick with what I\\'ve got. The second option you mentioned would be perfect, but from what I can tell, it doesn\\'t exist in Shopify. They apparently used to allow you to use 2 separate themes for desktop and mobile, but they no longer allow that. I just posted over in /r/shopify so maybe someone will chime in with more info. Thanks for all your help!, Hey. Use shopad\\n\\nhttp://theshoppad.com/shopify.html\\n\\nIt\\'s not the best looking .

Will definitely check that out! I heard shopify\\'s good too :)\\n\\nBtw no I don\\'t have additional stores, Brown Bucketeer was the only store I had :(, We make one, but it isn\\'t on the Shopify theme store. We customise it to each store owners specific requirements, as everybody has a different way of doing wholesale http://elkfox.com/shopify-wholesale\\n\\n-- edit --\\nI should add that we also have a way to show the wholesale products in a list format with a quantity and add button for each, or also just one button for a range of products to be added at once.

Utilizing shopify for your business will help in making your corporate website look more user friendly. , True! I\\'m not for a minute saying that they didn\\'t do this, just that the original intention wasn\\'t such. But obviously these Euro-centric maps were designed for use by Europeans, making it easy for them with Europe at the top in the middle, just like you said.

I haven\\'t found a similar graph about methanol. , Responsive themes are generally designed mobile-first. Creating a mobile version of your current theme / site requires these basic steps:\\n\\n1. Considering the different use cases of mobile customers - what do they want to do, know, see. In what context are they using the site. Mobile is less a screen size and more a use case;\\n2. Once you\\'ve decided what contents are appropriate, you can start thinking about the information architecture based on the user journeys you\\'ll have determined in step 1;\\n3. Once you have decided on the interaction, layout and design, you\\'ll need to code it.\\n\\nYou may be happy to do some or all of these yourself. I\\'d recommend beginning with step 1 though, and looking again at available responsive themes to see if they could meet your requirements., Just ordered the new Bob Moog Foundation poster - [Circuit of My Mind](http://bobmoogfoundation.myshopify.com/products/circuit-of-my-mind-art-poster).

ShipStation would not be able to automatically send your Shopify orders to FBA without any user intervention. The way the process works is that the order imports into ShipStation and the user would have to select the orders to send to FBA.

I totally relate re your comment about Shopify and customers.  For me, I need a solution to fit the needs of the client, who currently is in BigCommerce and very unhappy.  I don\\'t think the former service provider mapped out his needs very well and that has proved to be the problem now.  Because I do business consulting also, I have already discussed with them the need to start ramping up internal tech skills (now neophyte) if they want the new features and to save on external costs.

If you live somewhere where pot is frowned upon, you might get one head shop if you\\'re lucky, and they\\'ll charge whatever they want.\\n\\nBut if you live in a place with a relaxed stance towards pot, you\\'ll have lots of head shops competing with each other so you can get a better deal. \\n\\nI live in the latter, and I know a few places in my town where you can get a decent plastic bong [like these](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0353/9269/products/acrylic-water-pipe-assorted-colors-12-inch_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1410996503) for $10, and glass bongs [like these](http://www.gd-wholesale.com/userimg/23/3564i1/soft-glass-bongs-268.jpg) for $20.\\n\\nBut if by \"glass on glass\" you mean fancy bongs with a 2 piece bowl/stem, percolators, ice catchers, etc, then yeah, $50 is definitely the minimum, even in a place with a lot of head shops.\\n\\n, Hi Matt!\\n\\nThis is super exciting news!!!!!

Your homepage image is clearly taken on a cheap laminate floor (a professional backdrop/cardboard is about £5 from a hobbie store). Decide if you\\'re a photographer or a store owner, because the former is affecting the latter (in my opinion). You can get professional photos taken for about £30 each. \\n\\n• Who are you? There is no \\'about us\\' page. People want the story behind the candle as much as they want the candle itself. What\\'s your story? \\n\\n• Traffic. Writing this reddit post is probably going to bring more exposure than the instagram and facebook combined. Update reddit with sales (or lack of) data, and your experience/struggles - we love that shit. Have you tried advertising on facebook? You could target people who like similar companies/products and take it from there. Invest in social media but be patient. Post approx 4 RELEVANT images a day with hashtags so people find you. Better to have 10 interested followers than a 1000 uninterested followers. \\n\\nI hope the above doesn\\'t offend. Keep going and I wish you the best of luck. , About your page: I think the logo\\'s a bit too big and I\\'d skip the banner and show the product straight away, or at least have them in the banners. The black blob was off putting, especially with the instant popup that annoyed me. It\\'s a shame because I sort of thought the first impression was cheap/unprofessional but when I scrolled to the product I really like the stuff, so I think you got a good thing going there. Are people leaving the site after a few seconds or do they stick around?\\n\\nHow are you targeting your customers? Like for instance, that girl with the tattoos is really hot and might appeal to people with tattoos, so instead of targeting people who like ... I don\\'t know what you do now .. try to target people who are into tattoos. Just, think outside the box, what does your crowd like? Make a few highly targeted Facebook dark posts and see if you get a better conversion rate.

Drag and drop site creators and templates suck for SEO. You need to arrange the code and site content around your chosen key words. SEO is more than just throwing a few search terms into your content - theres a lot going on in the code its self.\\n\\nAlso, from a design point of view, when I log on to your site all I see is http://imgur.com/dCDi2f9.

If the pages are mobile friendly, they have a better chance to rank on mobile search compared to other websites and pages that are not. \\n\\nThe search results tables will be less likely to rank on mobile search. However, I assume that you wouldn\\'t want these pages ranking anyway? So in your case, I think it\\'s okay. But from a user experience perspective it\\'s not ideal. Users may not have a pleasant experience and may cause them to leave your website - increase bounce rate, shorter visit durations, fewer pages viewed, and the worst...losing conversions!\\n\\nIf you would like a page to rank on mobile search, then I would suggest making those pages responsive/mobile-friendly by finding an eCommerce platform that allows you more freedom with your design. I\\'ve had a pleasant experience with Shopify. \\n\\nHope this helps!\\n\\n**Edit**: If you notice that you may be losing traffic after the launch of your mobile version of the website make sure all your 301 redirections are set up correctly.  \\n\\n, Picked up my second [Engineered Garments piece](https://www.bluebuttonshop.com/imagedepot/S34/products/103418-01.jpg), should be in monday.

E.g you have an A/D converter such as a focusrite 2i2 or 2i4.  You \"know\" from mfg specs that THD+N is &lt;95dB or whatever, but that doesn\\'t tell you enough to measure with - you would need a distortion sweep for many many frequencies along the spectrum to match the result you obtain with it to the distortion of the test device itself.  If you measured something like THD+N = 84dB with that piece of equipment, you can\\'t quantify the error in your measurement so it isn\\'t valid.  \\n\\nFor disclosure, I work in optics as a student and professionally, but I also do live sound on the side.  Unfortunately I could not produce audio data for you if I tried, so I will use optical data to draw parallels.  \\n\\n[Here](http://i.imgur.com/fZ9U9DK.png) is a measurement of a part with spots taken in it as preparation for freeform polishing.  MetroPro is the software to control interferometers from Zygo such as the [Dynafiz](http://www.zygo.com/met/interferometers/dynafiz/dynamicinterferometers_lg.jpg) used to make this measurement.  In principal the machine works by using the *reference* part mounted to the front of the interferometer (you can see one in that picture, it is the flat piece of glass with a black retaining ring) with Zygo Corp engraved in the bottom to compare the part or system under test to.  What you get is a map of the wavefront or surface of the system/part under test with discrete samples for each pixel of the error compared to ref.  \\n\\nIn my screenshot there is a hot spot on the part it looks like.  Using your brain you can tell it is dust, so it is not real.  If you look at the part [before spots were put in it](http://i.imgur.com/UJmo6g9.png) there is still something there - what gives?  And the right spot is perturbed by another piece of dust which is now visible.  \\n\\nThese are system errors, or more accurately errors in the part being used to make spots.  A different machine is going to take those two measurements and subtract them to figure out what the spot is and produce [this](http://i.imgur.com/NZyA1cj.jpg).  It averages the four spots together, so they need to be as self-similar as possible.  Errors in alignment, testing, and machine errors in the machine that made the spot (which also analyzes) are going to bake into what the machine thinks its error is, since it uses this data to figure out what it can and can\\'t make.  The interferometer is worth somewhere in the range of $250k-$500k, and the polisher from QED runs about a cool $2m.  Errors like this are fundamental issues and cannot be avoided, good equipment allows you to quantify them and computationally remove them.\\n\\nI know the data that went into the spot screenshot above is perhaps slightly suspect because it has uncharacterized errors.  I\\'m getting very detailed feedback through the process of using these machines about the types and quantities of error at play by analyzing the data, and they are easy to see unlike audio errors.  You may have a spike in distortion at 8kHz, but it might be switching noise from the power supply of the 2i2.  It might be noise in the 2i2.  It might be a feature of the measurement mic.  You have *no idea* and have no tools with which to analyze the error, so it is uncharacterized and invalidates any data made with the test equipment.  \\n\\nSpeakers are typically tested in open air under controlled conditions.  \\n\\nA coupler like [this](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0362/2465/files/blog_ear-sim-300x275.gif?612) is used to measure headphones.  Otherwise a [full head](http://cdn.innerfidelity.com/images/110401_measure_photo_chamber.jpg) is used.  There is some debate over which is more accurate.\\n\\nMeasurement equipment should have THD+N in the ballpark of -140dB, likewise for dynamic range and so on.  Otherwise its errors (noise, etc) are significantly affecting the measurement. , That is a good point.  Most of the sites I am thinking of already have members.  I guess if you had a new site and handled all of the user accounts through Shopify you wouldn\\'t really need to have orders tied to Drupal accounts.

They are Sopify (hosted solution) and Magento (open source solution). For a small business like yours, they both will require a basic installation without any advanced features that you\\'ll be able to add when your business grows if required. \\n\\nThe good thing about Shopify is that it\\'s easy to install even for non-tech users. The bad thing about Shopify is that you\\'ll have to pay monthly fees not only for the service itself but also for each plugin you will want to add during your business life span.\\n\\nThe good thing about Magento is that you can pay only once for installation and deployment services and go on running business without any recurring monthly fees. A Magento downside is that you probably won\\'t be able to install the system by your own and will need to hire Magento developers.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to know more about these two eCommerce solutions you are welcome to read our recent article titled [Magento vs. Shopify. What eCommerce platform to use](http://quartsoft.com/blog/201504/magento-vs-shopify-what-ecommerce-platform-use). , My client needs to be able to sync shop inventory to Ebay.

You could also think about using WooCommerce. All three platforms are great. But I am using Shopify right now due to its ease of use.

It takes away some functionality like authentication, alerts, etc., however, you can index up to 500MB a day with that license. \\n\\nWhat I would recommend, and what I run at home, is to set up a spare laptop with something like Security Onion (http://blog.securityonion.net/), or really just a spare box running Bro (https://www.bro.org/) (unless you are interested in the security side of things as well). \\n\\nSearch around online for a small network tap, something like this (http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/throwing-star-lan-tap-pro?variant=216030698) would work, and is what I use. Plug that in between your router and modem, and then run a cable from one of the other ports to your security onion or bro box. If you\\'re not familiar, bro is an awesome network monitoring tool which will give you all the stuff you are looking for, stuff like, who is browsing what, what are the top talkers, traffic trends, etc. You could download some threat lists and check if any of your IP\\'s are talking with any malicious IP\\'s, etc.\\n\\nThat should hopefully get you started, but, feel free to reply if you have any other questions or PM me., This is something that I\\'m wrestling with, finding a watch that goes well with a dark suit for a wedding.\\n\\nhttp://www.gmtminusfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tissot-visodate-wrist.jpg\\n\\nhttp://cdn.styleforum.net/2/28/500x1000px-LL-28a62447_orig.jpeg\\n\\nhttp://www.bobswatches.com/rolex-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wrist-vintage-explorer.jpg\\n\\nhttp://revo-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/TankMCwrist.jpg\\n\\nhttp://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0153/3399/files/Rolex_submariner_with_a_black_white_blue_and_red_nato_watch_band_grande.JPG?1396\\n\\nhttp://styleforum-testing.s3.amazonaws.com/8/84/84acca15_vbattach50956.jpg\\n\\nhttp://s9.photobucket.com/user/Donut13/media/Alex/DSC_2632.jpg.html\\n\\nhttp://www.gmtminusfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tissot-visodate-milanais-03.jpg\\n\\nhttp://gearpatrol.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TISSOT-GEAR-PATROL1.jpg\\n\\nhttps://shahzamanmozumder.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/suit-shirt-cuff-watch.jpg\\n\\nI like the chrome case (should the case match cufflinks?), I\\'m tending towards the white dial, but I don\\'t know.\\n\\nProbably a black leather band., [Nothin\\' But an E\\' Thang!](https://it4db.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/dre-day-t-shirt), that\\'s the risk with indies sometimes.  a couple of things you can do:\\n\\nif you ordered through the etsy shop you can contact etsy to file a complaint. if you ordered through her primary shopfront, it looks like it\\'s run on the shopify platform.  you can also file a complaint with shopify.  i ordered a product from a shady dealer on shopify last year and finally did a live chat with their technical support.  they applied pressure on my behalf (they can revoke the shop\\'s account for not fulfilling orders) and my order was fulfilled less than a week later.\\n\\nIf you paid via paypal you can also file a dispute through them.  paypal is less friendly about disputes but if no other options work you should consider it.\\n\\nAll of that said, you\\'re going to need to give it a couple of weeks at least, maybe a month.  it hasn\\'t been a week yet so don\\'t panic.  some indie sellers are just terrible business people and may go silent when they feel like a customer is frustrated., We\\'re moving to Shopify in the next few weeks.

Get a proper site. It looks shitty. Get onto Shopify and buy yourself a monthly plan and a solid theme. Get some quality pictures taken.\\n\\n2. You\\'re not offering anything of value. Like others have said, I could create your logo in Photoshop in about 2 minutes.\\n\\n3. Your aims are all fucked up lol. \\'Still make a small profit\\' how\\'s that a winners mentality? You might make a small profit sticking to what you\\'re doing but you\\'ll give up in a couple months.\\n\\nWork on real designs, shit people look at and think \\'I wish i\\'d come up with that\\'. Sell a lifestyle, not your brand. Right now your shit is very very basic and I wouldn\\'t look twice at your site.\\n\\nThe only one that has any originality is the Goupil hoodie. I\\'d strip your site back, stop with the logo stuff and actually work on real designs. \\n\\nCustomers exchange their money depending on the value you offer to them. Can you make strangers feel good about parting with their money? , Don\\'t try to write a store by yourself unless you have 5+ years of intensive experience. Until then, use Magento, shopify or anything like that.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t install a store on xampp, wampserver or easyphp., It\\'s certainly possible but not something that\\'s built in to most themes by default so will be quite custom to do but possible \\n, I would also add that Shopify Payments/Stripe may not be an otion depending on the product\\'s risk profile and you end up having to chose a different provider anyway. However: Stripe isn\\'t exactly the cheapest option anyway if you see a good volume of transactions, so despite the added 1% charge you may still be better off with a different provider. Do the math before agreeing to anything., &gt; Also, assuming you trust Shopify Payments (Stripe), which was just bought by Paypal.\\n\\nHave you got a source for that? I\\'m pretty sure you\\'re mixing this up (PayPal bought Braintree a while ago). I\\'m working in payments and haven\\'t heard anything like that at all., If it is something you can make yourself then I would start small by making a test run and checking with friends and family to gauge their opinion.  I would also set up a website (Shopify, wordpress, Etsy, etc) to begin the ecommerce process while at the same time choosing whatever social media you want to target.  Start developing content, blogs, etc for the website for SEO and content purposes.  If it seems like it could grow into something bigger you could always do Kickstarter to raise funds.\\n\\nOn the flipside, if you can\\'t make the item yourself you need to find funding, a partner, or go straight to Kickstarter to raise funds for production., \\nA bank will not lend you money for vaporizers (even if you have all else in order)  and shopify will not let you host.  \\n\\nThe fulfilling of orders and answering customer issues is the easy part.  The hard part is building a business and growing sales.  \\n\\nWhen you are ready you need to start something small in your part  time without any loans.  \\n\\nYou will need to research your Compition and see if there is even any room for your business in the market.  \\n\\n, They do make IM Benadryl.

I\\'m wondering what the best way is to sync multiple stores, both in terms of content and orders, customers and inventory?, Honestly if he has a sense of humor this is a great gift for a golfer.\\n\\nhttp://nice-shot.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/the-bird-signature-edition?variant=1242456952, Shopify is pretty great.\\n\\nThe only drawback to it is not being able to send emails from your domain address., not right now, we had start a storenvy shop (very similar to shopify) at one point but couldn\\'t keep it going. , Don\\'t worry about hiring people until you need to. I\\'m in the process of starting my own business as well and it can be overwhelming but you can do it!\\n\\nIf you already have a product you\\'re passionate about you need to make sure it\\'s solving a problem someone else is having. It\\'s great to be on fire for something you believe in, but you\\'re not selling to yourself, you\\'re selling to other people. You always want to keep in mind what your customer wants/needs and try to cater to that. \\n\\nI use Shopify for my ecommerce store, but depending on what you\\'re selling you might be able to use Wordpress, or SquareSpace. As far as registering your business, do research on the different types of businesses you can file (LLC, S Corp, etc.). I\\'d recommend filing as an LLC since you\\'re just starting, but do the research for your own sake. \\n\\nThere\\'s a lot that goes into it. I\\'m still working through this myself. Good luck!, I don\\'t really know. We sell our products online. If it\\'s in person we use the Shopify POS app. , I\\'m a self taught developer.  My first gigs were getting paid a few hundred bucks worth of Bitcoin from people I met on reddit, which was 1.5 years ago. Now my projects are:\\n\\n**Developing a Shopify theme**.  Sounds simple but I\\'m working with a world class designer (has done work with the white house, snoop dogg).  I\\'ve made tonnes of sites before, but the level of detail here is next level.  Great for personal growth. \\n\\nLanguages: HTML, SCSS, \"Liquid\" (shopify\\'s templating language.  Pretty similar to most ones, not hard to pick up at all), JS.  Also git for every project I do.\\n\\nThis project looks like it\\'s around a month and a half\\'s work, but I may have underestimated so I\\'m putting in 10hr+ days now.\\n\\n**Doing a webapp, ios app, and android app for a government agency.**  I kind of inheirited this project.  I wrote the webapp myself, but the android/ios I\\'m mostly doing maintenence/adding new features.  Great to be paid to learn these.  I\\'m on retainer too basically, essentially getting guaranteed hours every month.\\n\\nWeb app was a single page web app made after the mobile apps were made, and was desired to feel \"appy\".  So, built a SPA with Knockout.js and jQuery.  iOS/Android are exactly what you think they\\'d be: ObjC/Java with XCode/Android Studio.\\n\\nThe most important thing is delivering and keeping your clients happy.  If you do that, you\\'ll go places., Bought some more Kent Wang polos to expand my collection, so navy and light pink.

To do that requires them to have direct access to what\\'s hosted on the domain.\\n\\nIf you set up Google Apps manually instead, you will be able to use whatever method of verification you want.  The easiest with Shopify is to [add a provided Meta tag to your home page.](https://support.google.com/a/answer/186017), This is a great question - think through your full vendor \\'stack\\' before you lock down any one vendor. You might find a low fee eCom platform, for example, but be limited to certain (more costly) methods of payment.\\n\\nWhen considering Shopify for example, [LemonStand](https://lemonstand.com/pricing) is feature for feature very comparable with no transaction fee for their software. A higher monthly flat fee, in this case, might end up saving you money in the long run. Lots of options., What I\\'m confused about is this:\\n\\n4.  Make sure your domain is using our default name servers. A bold, red message will appear at the top of the DNS Manager page if the domain is not. If you see this message, simply click the provided link and choose to apply our default name servers on the subsequent page. Then, return to the DNS Manager page (step 2 above) to complete the remaining steps below. (Please note that name server changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate).\\n\\nIf I switch to using NameSilo\\'s nameservers, then won\\'t shopify be inaccessible?\\n\\n(Sorry, I\\'m not terribly familiar with all the networking topology).  I\\'ve always pointed at the nameservers of my web host, not those of the domain provider, as I thought this was a requirement.  Maybe this is just a shortcut to avoid some configuration at the domain level?\\n\\n\\n, &gt;I *thought* I didn\\'t wanna wear a dress. Everyone thinks I\\'ll regret it. I *thought* I wanted our wedding to be so different from what folks are used to and everyone thinks I\\'ll change my mind when its too late. \\n\\nLots of people are willing to give unwanted opinions when wedding planning is going on, but here\\'s something people may not be so willing to say: you may *think* you want a big traditional wedding, but you\\'ll end up regretting having spent over $10k on a one-day 5 hour party. \\n\\nMaybe, maybe not. Tons of people don\\'t. \\n\\nNobody knows how you\\'ll actually feel! \\n\\nThose people are projecting. They\\'re transferring their own feelings onto you and pretending their feelings are your feelings. Ignore those people! \\n\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nMy friend and his wife (they have a 1yr old baby girl) got married in one of their relative\\'s backyards at an informal barbecue. I\\'m jealous; I want to do that. But their family and friends were small enough to do that; we have too many to fit in a backyard. (And public parks in my area don\\'t allow booze in the park. Lame!) But even still, our plan is to meet our parents and siblings and an officiant on the beach and have a quick standing ceremony, then walk over to a nearby restaurant for lunch. Then the next night have all our friends over for a house party in our backyard (which can fit our friends-only despite not fitting all 150 people we\\'d have to invite at a traditional wedding). \\n\\nI could not be more excited or more happy about our plan. It is so perfectly us. I feel no stress or anxiety over fulfilling grand expectations for a huge party with everyone in our family, as much as I love my family and love seeing them at reunions. \\n\\nAnd you mention not wanting a dress... I always knew I didn\\'t want a traditional long white wedding dress, but I really didn\\'t know what to do instead. It\\'s amazing because once we nailed down our plans and our location and it just felt so right, suddenly the style and type of dress for me to wear became clear in my mind because I had the context of the event to help me. [I\\'ve found it!](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0209/8294/products/Elizabeth_Dress_Front_large.jpg?v=1370627269%27) I\\'m so excited!!! \\n\\nMake yourself this excited over your wedding! You ought to be gushing and typing out \"I\\'m so excited!!!!\" like I just did above. Until you find that perfect event for YOU and YOUR FH, *not for other people!*, and until you feel excited, keep brainstorming and doing your own planning, ignoring others, until you find that feeling!, That\\'s only if you\\'re using NameSilo\\'s setup wizard - which will in fact make your Shopify store be inaccessible to anyone visiting the site during the setup period.  \\n\\nDon\\'t use their wizard.  \\n\\nJust set it up yourself by following [Google\\'s instructions.](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1186224?hl=en)  It\\'s mostly just update the MX records in your NameSilo account, and copy/paste some HTML code into your Shopify store for verification purposes.  , So basically, A record and CNAME in NameSilo point to Shopify Servers, but MX server points to Google Apps?, Exactly., Got it - thank you.  Why is it that most shared hosts have you use their nameservers?

And actually nothing through ebay, I have other means of generating website traffic.\\n\\nSo prepaid cards you use didn\\'t get limited?  About how much money were you pushing through them weekly?  I think using prepaid cards are the way to do this until I set up offshore accounts.  If I set up 20 prepaid cards linked to 20 shopify accounts, then routed my traffic through a shortener like MultiURL, I can equally disperse my traffic amongst the sites, only depositing about $100-150 a day via ACH to each card.  , Hmm, interesting.

Every portable hard drive I have seen has a port on the outside where the cable plugs into it. And it sticks out  just waiting to be damaged. They need a compartment where the cable\\'s plug plugs into. And the compartment also grips the cable (about an inch from the cable end) so that IF the cable accidentally gets jerked.... the plug and port are not damaged.  Just possibly the cable which can be easily replaced. Also.... portable Hard drives alllllllll need a small channel that the cable snugly fits into so that  the cable is always with the hard drive. Not seperate. [I\\'ve seen it on portable dvd drives](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0154/4091/products/usbportabledvdromdrive3_large.jpg?v=1334913148).... so why the fuck not on portable hard drives? I figure having both the cable end in the sealed compartment while also having a channel (say... all around the outer edge of the hard drive case) would be a very sensible design. \\n\\nedit: found a [pic of one](http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Clickfree-C2-Portable-Hard-Drive_2.jpg) like I am talking about.

But I would like the hidden end of the cable to be in an openable compartment so that the cable can be removed and replaced in case it gets damaged.

There really isn\\'t an exhaustive central resource for everything that can be bought with dogecoin (I tried to make one once, it\\'s a long story, but it doesn\\'t exist anymore).  Here\\'s a few attempts, but I don\\'t think any of them are complete, but between all of them you\\'ll get like 95% of the stuff:\\n\\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/wiki/shop_with_dogecoin, \\n\\nhttp://dogedir.com/, \\n\\nhttp://dogebiz.net/, \\n\\nhttp://www.dogecoin.link/, (this one has a sidebar pic here)\\n\\nhttp://shibify.com/, \\n\\nhttp://muchmarket.com,\\n\\n http://shibebox.com, \\n\\nhttp://suchlist.com, \\n\\nhttp://www.dogedoor.net/dogecoin-business-directory/\\n\\n/r/dogemarket, \\n\\n/r/dogevendors and \\n\\nhttp://bitcoinshop.us, for starters.  \\n\\n+/u/dogetipbot megaroll verify\\n\\nLots of shopify.com and etsy.com merchants out there accept it too, but I don\\'t know if there\\'s a comprehensive list\\n\\n2.  Your guess is as good as anyone\\'s as to reasons behind the price increase.  Cryptos are a bit like penny stocks, in that they have relatively low volume being traded.  This means that it doesn\\'t take a lot to increase the price.  For example, on an exchange right now there are 10 bitcoins worth of doge sell orders at 85 satoshi and 10 bitcoin worth of buy orders at 84 satoshi.  This means 10 bitcoins, about $2400 worth, can bump the dogecoin price by more than 1%.  1% of our market cap is about $200,000.  $2400 can increase our market cap by $200,000.  That\\'s one reason it\\'s so volatile, relatively low exchange volume.  Whales, speculators and day traders often use this to pump prices, or dump them, in a game against each other called the free market.  \\n\\nAs for why it\\'s mostly in China, who knows, cause China has the most people?  A lot of Chinese exchanges have no fees, which means people can buy and sell to themselves over and over at no loss, so a lot of Chinese volume is fake.  But it\\'s true that it\\'s Chinese pumping the price the past week.\\n\\n3.  Mining doge isn\\'t very feasible anymore, unless you have tens of thousands of dollars to set up, live in an area with the world\\'s cheapest electricity, and are willing to wait a few years to get a return on your equipment investment.\\n\\n4.  It\\'s money, so ya know, make money.  Sell stuff at the sites I mentioned in 1.\\n\\n5.  When the price rises I like to buy some stuff for dogecoin.  If you bought doge at a lower value then when you spend it during a rise you are basically getting a discount on the item.  And it helps our vendors and dogeconomy unlike just selling for bit coin or fiat \\n\\n+/u/dogetipbot megaroll verify, Thanks. Do you still consult? Might be looking for a Shopify designer. , Like discounts for the Shopify platform?  I\\'ve never seen those but maybe someone else has?

Really nice support staff they have., &gt;[Shopping Cart by Shopify.](http://www.shopify.com/tour/shopping-cart)\\n\\nIts not at all unlikely that they just opted for the ecommerce platform, shoppify being the most popular one these days, and chose the same minimal stock theme.

Let\\'s see. My last eCommerce company was set up like this:\\n\\nAt first, MarkH@domain.com for individual employee accounts. This worked well until out team grew tremendously. We also had an impressive number of Kevins at the company, so we ultimately changed it to MHolmes@domain.com. \\n\\nsupport@domain.com, info@domain.com, and hi@domain.com were our \"catch-all\" email addresses (the latter two set up as aliases for the first one) for basic inquiries and help questions.\\n\\nsales@domain.com went to our few sales reps who dealt with large orders. This wasn\\'t used too often though, as we generally got sales inquiries over the phone and our salespeople contacted them directly.\\n\\nOur sent-from email address for anything order-related was aliased as orders@domain.com, but the actual reply-to would simply be support@domain.com. \\n\\nOur customer support improved tremendously when we implemented Zendesk, though.

Use this to your advantage for aftersales emails to amazon and ebay customers to try and bring them to your site. \\n\\nWith both amazon and ebay to be really competitive you can also use repricing software to undercut competitors and ensue your products are highly visible to buyers., I would say shopify if you are starting out. Can always move on to a bespoke website later on once you are established / making decent profits. , I have that one, [but in blue with a white A](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0141/5792/products/Athletics_1935-1949_Cap_ab7b036f-3ffb-40a0-a96c-4c5be9ce1958_grande.jpg?v=1431467817).

There\\'s no reason you should develop a shopping cart yourself., Thanks very much., Very difficult, but fun to think about. Here\\'s my list: \\n\\n* Winter: [St. Crispin balmoral boot](http://leathersoulhawaii.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/4011.jpg)\\n\\n* Spring: [Saint Crispin 575 in pebbled calf](http://www.claymoorslist.com/wp-content/uploads/tumblr_mtdxggmOw31qdtc47o1_1280.jpg)\\n\\n* Summer: [Carmina Uatem string loafer in suede](http://36.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4u3l7b75t1qad1efo1_500.jpg)\\n\\n* Fall: [Carmina chukka in chocolate suede](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0277/2511/products/Carmina-80302-Chukka-01_1024x1024.jpg)\\n\\nI own 3 of them, though the chukka in a lighter suede. Saving up for the 575. One day., I\\'ve been a web developer for over 10 years and make a good portion of my yearly income from building sites for companies.\\n\\nThe rest of my income comes from my online stores which use shopify.\\n\\nThe biggest downside is that the way shopify handles addons has led to a culture of monthly fees for even the simplest of addons (like back in stock notifications).\\n\\n, Shopify when you are beginning for sure., I\\'m twin sticking mine and will sell you my stock lever assy. if you want it. \\n\\nIf you do want to twin stick yours I would recommend http://jb-custom-fabrication.myshopify.com, In your case I would recommend setting up a landing page for your product. Keep the site fairly simple, maybe just a few pages.\\n\\nUse the top of your main page to hit all of the high notes for your product, especially things like how it can help drive sales and get return customers since it is a coupon extension. Since your product is only $9.99/month, you can probably use that as a selling point. Lay out all of the features and benefits of your extension, and then drive it home by showing that the price isn\\'t outrageous.\\n\\nFor the landing page itself, I would recommend WordPress as I usually do. There are a lot of great landing page templates available for free. You would probably do well to check out a theme called Zerif Lite. It\\'s a very clean theme that you can do a lot with, the header would be perfect for showing examples of your extension in action. There are 4 featured content sections in that theme, use them to highlight exactly why people should purchase your extension.\\n\\nNow to market your extension, I would purchase some Facebook advertising and target FB users who like/follow/use FB groups centered around Shopify. I did a quick search on FB and you should have plenty of people to target there. You can either set your ads to direct people to your landing page, or take them directly to the shopify store to purchase the app. I would probably recommend directing them to the landing page, since you\\'ll be better able to convince them that buying your app is worth it, whereas when people are instantly confronted with a monthly fee and no real explanation as to the value of the product, they\\'ll be less likely to convert.\\n\\nHope this helps!, \"If you want to build a business build it on Shopify, if you want to build an empire build Shopify\"\\n\\nIf your product will be only a good then Shopify may be good, Shopify is great, I customised my sister\\'s site, it looks phenomenal and didn\\'t take me long. We used a paid for theme as a base and customised it from there. Took me about 4 days and that included adding extra functionality like recently viewed items.\\n\\nUnless you have a really unique sales process shopify is the way to start out., Yeah, when we switched over to Shopify I created a universal code that doesn\\'t expire and can be used as many times as necessary.

We had the option to hack our product to make it fit for cratejoy / shopify + plugins or custom built.  We ended up building our own.  Another solution we looked at was woocommerce + plugins and authorize.net\\'s AIM subscription module. , Wait, were you able to use Stripe\\'s API even if you have only the Shopify Payments account?\\n\\n(Also, never use AIM!  It\\'s a PCI compliance nightmare.  If you use authorize use DPM or SIM instead)., What\\'s the reason to have your own cart?  Do you already have customers lined up?  Test your concept with some turnkey carts shopify is good but there is also storeenvy.  I consult startups and also provide code development if needed, building your own can get expensive if you\\'re not prepared for it. , We didnt use shopify in the end, stripe api usage was referring to our custom build.

Did traffic stay the same?, Great to know about you guys, i have been selling to e-commerce guys and we currently have more than 2k+ customers so i might have a thing or two to say. I would say there multiple ways you could do this (Inbound &amp; Outbound).  I am writing more about outbound because in my experience for bigger e-commerce guys the involvement is quite high touch and you have to take it slow.\\n\\n**For Outbound** - I would use something like a Datanyze/BuiltWith kind of a tool to help me to my initial research. You can keep a track of which competitor products are being used by which domain names and a lot more. Once you get a list of domain names, you can filter by gross revenue, location and other parameters to find the top domains you want to reach out. Now you can get in touch with Product/Marketing Managers (assuming its a marketing product) or appropriate person based on the type of product. Try connecting over Linkedin first. The best way is to multiply your customers using customers themselves. The process is slow at start but you can rapidly build on it as you go along. You could always go pickup booth at IRCE or other e-commerce conferences. That definitely helps. You can also follow your TG on Twitter etc to build up a rapport and engage them in conversations and go from there. Hosting webinars etc also helps. Also, doing channel partnerships will help, get in touch with BigCommerce, Shopify, Demandware, Magento developers are more.\\n\\n**For Inbound** - There are multiple avenues for this. You can start building relevant content for your TG (infographics, blogs, tweets and more). Build SEO, Optimize Landing Pages and a lot more. \\n\\nHope this helps. I would love to chat more, drop me a line., I don\\'t know how cheap you are looking for, but Triune Films has [several fight SFX packs](http://triune-store.myshopify.com/collections/sound-effects) with many options., Oh, we can get 3L bottles here which is a bit less than one gallon, but they\\'re a different shape.

Harbor Freight for like $4 if you are stateside. Then, clamp the clamp to a ground source. I use a seat mount bolt when in cab. Then with the prong end, touch the metal spot on the top of a fuse with your key on. IF the light on the test light comes on, this means your ground clamp is good. IF you cannot get the light to come on, fix the clamp. Next turn the key off and see if the fuse you have checked loses power. IF so, that means the circuit is switched. \\n\\nNext, you can get a [fuse tap](http://www.pnw4runners.com/tech/fuse_tap.jpg).

IF you need a deeper explanation or help, just message or reply.\\n\\nHope this helps, https://github.com/postcss/postcss\\n\\n&gt; PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JS plugins. These plugins can support variables and mixins, transpile future CSS syntax, inline images, and more.\\n\\n&gt;PostCSS is used by Google, Twitter, Alibaba, and Shopify. Its plugin, Autoprefixer, is one of the most popular CSS processors.\\n\\n&gt;PostCSS can do the same work as preprocessors like Sass, Less, and Stylus. But PostCSS is modular, 3-30 times faster, and much more powerful., As with anything, there are definitely little niches you can specialize in. Now that Automatticc has bought it, probably worth looking into. \\n\\nThat said, Shopify just did an IPO and is growing at a crazy pace - it might be worth learning how to run Shopify sites.  \\n\\nMy personal opinion is to never do self-hosted ecommerence - too risky and way more intricate than you think . , Hi it seems you are looking for a job in following categories : [#Python](http://wanna.work/t/Python) [#Shopify](http://wanna.work/t/Shopify) \\n\\nPerhaps you would be interested in following job offers : \\n\\n[[Hiring] (Nashville, TN/telecommute) Python Developer/Linux Sysadmin Needed](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/37qzfa/hiring_nashville_tntelecommute_python/) #Python \\n\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\n^^If ^^you ^^do ^^not ^^want ^^to ^^receive ^^those ^^recommendations ^^click ^^[here](http://wanna.work/unsubscribe). ^^Please ^^note ^^you ^^need ^^to ^^login ^^with ^^your ^^Reddit ^^account.\\n\\n^^If ^^you ^^have ^^any ^^feedback ^^or ^^complaint ^^please ^^[contact](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=wonglik) ^^my ^^creator., I\\'m using shopify :) , I know/use both and prefer Shopify., Try the leading global ecommerce solution with over 150,000 successful merchants.\\n\\nShopify customers\\n, \\nHey thanks for your reply, really appreciate the feedback.\\n\\nI agree the art is the easy bit. In terms of market penetration I would use a number of methods. Shopify for (higher value) direct sales, sales reps, social media and good old fashioned speculative mail shots to independent stores etc. I also happen to live in a place where this industry has a strong base so I think this potentially puts me at an advantage (albeit small). \\n\\nRe the math, again I agree. If I\\'m totally honest I\\'m looking for artists who will provide the art for a nominal sum or preferably royalty only. I\\'m aware this will only attract a certain number of artists but I\\'ll be looking for people who want to get involved because they think it will be a fun project and they wish to get their art out there (in return for a fair royalty). I want to run the project as a community led thing where all people involved can have a say. I\\'m not forgetting this thing needs to make money but I want it to be an enjoyable project and have a \"ride along\" feel if that makes sense. \\n\\nI\\'m looking to target a demographic which is largely untapped i.e people in their 20\\'s / 30\\'s that enjoy reddit style humour, hence the bad art vibe. That\\'s why I want to source ideas from this community and print /distribute with the help of a community such as this. \\n\\nThe idea of this is to be very organic but ultimately scalable (prints, mugs etc perhaps?), but requires good will from people to help turn something small into something hopefully substantially much bigger in the future for mutual gain. \\n\\nSorry for the wall but I hope that explains the vision a little!, Stripe is great, used it for like three years.

And would they be \"You\" if they were having a different experience? And why would there be only one of each type of experience - why wouldn\\'t there be multiple identical worlds for you to experience?\\n\\nThe longer answer is: You need to do a bit of contemplation and meditation to realise this. A couple of things: to realise that you \"having an experience\" rather than \"being a person\" (that you are a \"conscious space\"), and that the world isn\\'t spatially-extended other than in your experience of it (there are not literally multiple physical universes out there).\\n\\nFor directly investigating the first, you might try out [this little exercise](http://www.reddit.com/r/Oneirosophy/comments/2loaw1/outside_the_dreaming_game/) to get a feel for it for fun.

While it makes a catchy headline to call an Asian condom too small for Africans, the real issue is the material and approval of the WHO. It is great that the courts are taking the quality of condoms imported into their country seriously.\\n\\nCondoms, however, can be blown up to the size of a balloon and fit over a mans head. They are almost universally *never* too small. The issue is their strength and shear resistance. Even in the U.S., magnum condoms are pretty much a marketing tool and are nearly identical in size to a regular condom. The FDA and the condom companies themselves would never allow insecure men to purchase a product that would lower the % effectiveness of their product or put the public in extra danger.\\n\\n\\nMen who are actually extremely endowed can special order condoms online that will be more comfortable, but a normal condom will still work. Finding a condom that is comfortable is very important retaining an enjoyable sexual experience so by no means am I saying don\\'t shop around. Thickness, shape, texture, tensile strength are all going to effect how a condom feels, and minimizing discomfort is a plus (cause lets face it, condoms are a necessary evil..). However the generic \"I need a magnum for my monster dong\" line is pretty much universally bullshit.\\n\\n**EDIT**[ As expected, a lot of upvotes but contrarian responses.

They make a decent product that people seem to want to use. But their product isn\\'t particularly revolutionary nor do they seem to have a track record of innovation that will keep them out front. Yahoo, Go Daddy, and other companies have all provided a similar, if inferior, service for decades. Shopify has created a better product, but it is not that much better or, more importantly, impossible to imitate. I see the stock going up, boosted by positive investor sentiment, and than tanking once the street realizes that this company isn\\'t capable of exponential growth. The R &amp; D and marketing spending just isn\\'t there. Finally, the biggest consumer of shopify\\'s services are niche small business. These types of customers, i think, can\\'t support a tremendous amount of growth. Maybe in a year, once the share price has sunk, their may be some value in the company as a takeover target or low yield dividend stock. Though, who knows, maybe management is capable of something extra special. , I have a question.

Thats why I was looking at Volusion or Shopify, as they take care of the hosting and merchant services., Is open cart a separate site like Shopify or is it a plugin like Woocommerce for Wordpress? I do like Journal, so if I do go wordpress route I would use that one, looks super flexible. Do you know how the speed is of the Journal theme?, There are *far* more Seiko 5s than the one you\\'re thinking of (presumably the [SNK809](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0077/4222/products/seiko_snk809_automatic_watch_black2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1315498543))\\n\\nAlso, I would say that Seiko have far more of a history than the current iterations of Laco or Stowa.\\n\\n, I have not used Shopify but it is well reviewed and reputable - especially with developers. If the ecommerce portion is a major part of the system I would go with Shopify - I really dislike integrating any sort of ecommerce system with Wordpress I find it too bloated., Shopify is a entire solution: You host your site with them but you can build themes for your site like Wordpress (it\\'s actually a lot easier since they use a real templating system). They have analytics and a complete ecommerce dashboard. They are very reliable. \\n\\nOne thing that you may not like is that it\\'s CMS is not very advanced. If you need multiple content areas then you have to resort to hacks and workarounds., Idk if I\\'m wrong but I believe Shopify is running on Rails, it is a huge platform and highly complex. It is a great example of how Rails can be scaled effectively. For a brief overview of their size check this slideshare: http://www.slideshare.net/jduff/how-shopify-scales-rails-20443485, Shopify is awesome because they completely manage all your products, orders and you have analytics all in the dashboard.  It\\'s super easy to use.  I find though you have less control over your site design and feature wise though.\\n\\nIf you want a giant elaborate site WordPress will let you do that and you have way more options.  If you\\'re trying to do an online store with WordPress though I find WooCommerce (a free online store plugin) is a bit more complicated and not quite as well designed.\\n\\nFor running an online store if that\\'s your primary thing then I highly recommend Shopify.  Or if you need something a bit more crazy you can always build the website with WordPress and then set up a store with Shopify.\\n\\nI did this for a client once, their main site was domain.com and their Shopify store was store.domain.com.  We matched the store\\'s design to the WordPress theme best we could and it seemed to work out decently well., Shopify definitely uses Rails.\\n\\nSource: [rubyonrails.com](http://rubyonrails.org/), I used to wear those red tint glasses with bleached tips and a pooka shell necklace. \\n\\nI think I turned out okay. \\n\\n\\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0193/6253/products/8405c.jpg?v=1432752269, If your not a developer, shopify is easiest.\\n\\nI would greatly suggest starting off with amazon and eBay first. Half the battle is getting traffic to your site and amazon/ebay solves that problem.\\n\\nIf you have zero SEO knowledge then save the store/custom website for later., Your a developer at Shopify? The numbers in slide 11 really shows how you guys follow test driven development. Has there ever been discussion of switching to Postgres?, So are you suggesting running an ecommerce platform like woocommerce/shopify/magento and then sending the purchase and shipment info to your dropshippers manually?, Also, if you are having trouble remembering commands and such, I like this cheat sheet the best: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0165/4168/files/preview.png, You\\'re welcome!\\n\\nThat looks like it\\'s a good way to get feedback! Are you using shopify for the site or something else?, There are actually a few good games that fit this description, and they are probably worthy games, although I did not get into them.\\n\\nThe first one that springs to mind as a game that was too hard for me is Core War. Write a program in Core War\\'s assembly language that wipes out competing programs to take over memory space. Battles take place in real time with the memory represented visually so players can watch their programs fight. Its barrier of entry is really high. Too high for me. I never got into it, but I downloaded some pre-written programs and watched them fight, which was super fun.\\n\\nFacebook had a game for a while called Dinosaur Island. It was part of their hiring process, where top Dinosaur Island players would be granted job interviews. Facebook hosted a server and documented how the API worked so that players could write their own custom clients and AI that controlled dinosaurs on an island, which competed to survive against each other. I got lost in the documentation and never even connected to the server. I suppose technically, there were optional graphics, in that players could make graphics if they wanted.\\n\\nImpossibly Complicated Flight Simulator 3000 (or whatever the name is). There are a bunch of these types of games where learning how to play is as complicated as learning how to pilot a real plane. \\n\\nKerbal Space Program. It\\'s on my \"to play\" list. My understanding is that it\\'s a game about orbital mechanics. Not sure on the smartness requirement, but it looks engaging and seems to have a lot of free-form decision making.\\n\\nShopify. Start an e-commerce business and compete with other businesses for customers in your chosen niche. Generate revenue and foster long-term relationships with customers in order to secure repeat business. Barrier of entry is very high, but you can get real-world money from this one. Not strictly a video game, but it can all be done on-screen. I\\'m learning the basics of this one now, and I hope to start playing soon., Just a single page word press theme and the form is from gravity forms with stripe plug in. I tried crate joy and it just didn\\'t have all of the features I felt I needed to make it successful, though it did make some parts easier. Perhaps I\\'ll switch to it once I\\' get more steady traffic. I haven\\'t looked into shopify though. Should I?, We use shopify for our store www.newmen.co.uk \\n\\nReally happy with it, easy to use and some great templates available., I made hometownpint.com using Shopify and I personally think it\\'s a great platform to start your eCommerce store on. I was previously using Magento Go which shut down not too long ago. I guess my only complaint with Shopify is bulk edits. It can be a bit cumbersome even after exporting, but it\\'s more than manageable (I just have a ton of products). Being familiar with the basics of HTML/CSS will significantly help you make small changes to adjust any theme more to your liking, but it\\'s not necessarily required., Definitely go with shopify. There\\'s plenty of themes and add ons to get where you want to. No need to learn any programming. Just TEST everything before you go live., I think it\\'s a huge hole in Shopify\\'s offering. How much more work would it really take them to offer a simple plugin or even a good workaround for everyone. , Set it up to use Shopify payments or stripe then., If Wordpress is working for you, then I wouldn\\'t worry too much about it. I\\'ve only used the shopify trial, so my experience is limited.\\n\\nMigrating to shopify could potentially be more hassle than what it is worth., You may want to consider your own shop on shopify or a similar ecommerce platform. They\\'re pretty cheap to set up, and your visitors don\\'t have 500 people undercutting you on the same site., &gt; I am not sure how reliable it is in terms of speed, flexibility with design and ease of use for both the designer and the client\\n\\nThis is literally what Shopify was designed for. Everything is customizable, it is extremely fast, and the client admin panel is very easy to use. I brought my previous company to Shopify from Magento and it was a huge plus. Shopify does a pretty good job managing third-party apps as well, which is good news for clients. Most small business software has some way to connect with Shopify at this point - Zendesk, Shipstation, Quickbooks, Xero, Mailchimp... the list goes on.\\n\\nWooCommerce (and Wordpress in general) can be a pain, especially if you\\'re hosting it yourself and don\\'t know what you\\'re doing (no offense). Unless you\\'re prepared to hire sysadmins and developers, go with a hosted solution. If you get to a point where hiring those people might make sense, then you can reconsider your platform., Opencart is its own software, similar to Magento CE. I would avoid Wordpress for eCommerce and would instead recommend choosing a hosted platform (Shopify, BigCommerce, etc)., Nice! So you collected emails before launch I guess? When did you start collecting (how many weeks before launch)? What sort of market are you in? \\n\\nI\\'m wondering how to launch my product (a simple kitchen gadget, around $10). I feel Kickstarter is great for potential free marketing etc, but tbh I don\\'t really need the cash to tool and make first batch. It would more be for testing the market and marketing. Other option is just a traditional launch via a shopify style site - but I have zero experience at diverting traffic to a site like that, would be starting from scratch. , I work(ed) for Shopify. They\\'ve been great in understanding and being patient since there\\'s not much to be done. 2.5 years later and my job will still be waiting when I\\'m ready to go back. The return to date just keeps getting pushed back though so it\\'s hard to stay optimistic. , Magento is good for large stores with complex selling models (variations, customization) It requires a lot of resources to run so you better have a reliable host with ample space.\\n\\nVolusion (hosted) sucks\\nShopify/Big Commerce- excellent but you\\'ll run into a few problems when the site needs to be customized. It\\'s also expensive\\n\\nWoo Commerce: Build on Wordpress so really good for SEO. Plugins are expensive BUT you can hire a developer for cheap to do wtvr you want.  I use WC for most of my e-commerce sites. Alternative to WC is Prestashop but plugins and dev costs tend to be high.\\n\\nThe others aren\\'t worth playing around with. , [There\\'s](http://killborngraphics.com/storage/2014/09/Children-of-the-Forest.jpg)         \\n[some](http://i.imgur.com/3LlHWTd.jpg)    \\n[debate](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0048/1702/products/forsmanelvestree_1024x1024.jpg?v=1372887123), They have a LOT of holes.  \\n\\n- Real-time shipping quotes not included in the plan like Squarespace does.  \\n- No custom fields for templates unless you use some really hacky Chrome Plugins.  \\n- No built in email.   \\n- No web interface for their POS system if you need to process phone orders.  \\n- No categories for the blogs. \\n- No control over URL paths.  (every product category url is long - shopify.com/collection/collection-name, etc), I work for Shopify and in doing so have access to set up a free shop to sell Dogecoin shirts, and accept dogecoin for them....If you shibes are interested, I\\'ll get cracking on that tonight. :), If you\\'re looking for something simple like a single page product description, maybe look into leadpages.net integrated with Stripe. You lose all of the inventory management and order management functions of Shopify but it\\'s dead simple setup. \\n\\nOn the flip side, I love Shopify. It may be worth you hiring a developer if your requirements are simple enough. , * Inventory count\\n* Available sizes\\n* Information on the company/event\\n* Clearly stated shipping costs or just make the shirts $12 w/ free shipping (this is assuming all shipping costs are less than $4.50). \\n* Better checkout flow. The site could be built on shopify, or just incorporate Stripe in to what you\\'ve got. It states \"No need to create an account!\"  but filling out a google form feels more sketchier than creating a regular account..., I think there is nothing called drop shipping software. if you want to sell online on your own store you can use tool like shopify for example. if you want to see list of legitimate drop shipping companies and suppliers you can use service like salehoo. If you want do market research on ebay you may use tool like terapeak. and so on. so every tool has its own function and you can combine them all to do great drop shipping business. , Not sure how high the quality needs to be, you could convert this to vector though\\n\\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0384/0921/products/karate-kid-tenugui.3.jpeg?v=1416414471, I think that\\'s a great idea and it allows another revenue stream into your business. So if you don\\'t want to start an apparel business, but want apparel there\\'s a good site theprintful.com that will basically dropship your tshirts for you. You can even have your own label and tags. The only draw back is that it\\'s expensive with their costs.\\n\\nSo say a shirt from them costs 16.00 + $5.50 shipping they charge already for costs it\\'s $21.50 without your markup so you can profit. So you\\'re looking at pricing your shirts in the minumium high $20s to make money.\\n\\nThe good thing is they can produce one shirt at a time, you handle nothing but actually ordering or you can have that automated easily, they have integration with shopify, woocommerce, etc. They have a free mockup generator you can use for product display. All you would really need is your own designs. Theyp have shirts from American Apparel, etc.\\n\\nHope this helps and if you have any other questions ask away, My site www.wavesapparel.com is built on shopify on a free template. You can create a landing page with whatever large graphic you want and text explaining everything, then simply add one product to the collections.\\n\\n, [It\\'s simple.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/6917/products/consultingdemotivator.jpeg?v=1416776147), *SQUEE!!* :D\\n\\nI want to see what you create with it! &lt;3 Did you get the full size with [Lance Bass](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0385/8061/products/loveatfirstlance3-400x400_1024x1024.jpg?v=1426424985) on the lid? lolll, http://justvapeinc.myshopify.com/products/the-vector-rda-by-vls-vapourlifestyle\\n\\nhttp://www.vapordna.com/Project-Sub-Ohm-Edition-Hobo-V3-RDA-by-Hobo-Custom-p/psohb3.htm\\n\\ni really want the hobo v3 -.- , but dunno where to order it from., Absolutely. Are you actually making innovative (or at least cool) stuff? There\\'s no better way to promote your stuff than to continue playing dumb (or just fake it) and use your blog as a resource to show off doing cool stuff with your products. \\n\\nSeriously. You\\'ve got a blog that people want to read and products that people might want? Ride the wave. \\n\\nAlso, you could look into using some sort of Shopify-Wordpress integration and keep the blog setup as it is. , Or you can, like, look at their code.\\nhttps://github.com/Shopify/, I offer wholesale on my Shopify site using the \"Locksmith\" app.\\n\\nMy wholesale offerings are by quantity, and not individual item(s).  So, I set up a wholesale only page that is password (and customer tag) protected through Locksmith.  This way, only customers that I tag as \"wholesale\" can access it.  They order just like anyone else on my site., Dude. I went to the top graphic design course in the UK, and it sucked! It was student driven with absolutely no guidance after the first year when the industry stalwart tutor left, I left after two years and am in the industry killing it, whereas 90% of my peers are not even in design anymore.\\n\\nI\\'m lucky that I\\'m self taught in adobe stuff since I was about 14, but the people that came in with limited knowledge were screwed!\\n\\nIn regards to work and font choice/everything, experimentation is the key. Sometimes you can see a lovely font in black and white and think it looks utterly dull but as soon as you set it up in the colour way you intend to use or nail the layout it becomes the perfect choice. I\\'m a perfectionist too and I used to let it hold me back but sometimes you\\'ve just gotta get it out there and let it go. Other people may love it whilst you hate it entirely but it\\'s out their for support and criticism from everyone. I sometimes go back to old projects and look at how I would do it now or how I can tweak it. \\n\\nMistakes have to be made to progress, thats life. Look at the incredibly successful people of the world, they failed plenty of times before they nailed it and that applies to the creative process too. By constantly experimenting you will make bad mistakes and good mistakes, the sort of tiny things that may change your whole outlook on a project or the direction of something minor.\\n\\nDesign is such a broad world, I currently work in sportswear design but with plenty of graphics, pattern making, packaging and digital stuff involved in that. Not all work is agency work.\\n\\nIn terms of self-motivation, you can make random briefs or create a portmanteau of two words or - http://www.shopify.co.uk/tools/business-name-generator\\n\\nUse that and just design for one of the many suggestions!\\n\\nAnyway keep it up man, uni for me didn\\'t help a great deal but the industry has given me a great outlook on process and design as a whole. If it\\'s any consolation, I missed so many of my design critiques in uni and looking back now I wished I had gone to them. You can face that anxiety and become a better designer for it. x, The coil head is chunky as fuck though. Probably the biggest I\\'ve ever used http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0272/6333/products/zephyrus-3_copy_c56a265c-e429-4643-9dc8-ab8f32d9319d.jpg?v=1432925291, Thanks, super helpful! I tried to lead the clients decision into Shopify. Only problem is I\\'ll have to learn .liquid?, &gt;I spent probably 5 hours tonight looking at Joomla, because that was the advice I got and again no comprende.\\n\\nIt should be no comprendo, actually :P.\\n\\nBut all joking aside.  You should listen to /u/Scottie_N.  If this isn\\'t something you can actually accomplish (it sounds like a really big task), then I wouldn\\'t risk your job on it.  But if you want to learn web design and development, more power to you :).\\n\\nThe two important pages would require a CMS and some sort of store front application like Shopify or something (I\\'m not familiar with that) and APIs for the Twitter and Facebook implementations/connections.  Those APIs are I think written in Javascript but I believe are fairly easy to implement on a site.  Just gotta read through the documentation. , It\\'s a [helix](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0353/9269/products/Red_Helix_mini_14_inches_grande.jpg?v=1430184042), they\\'re pretty nice pieces., I really appreciate that and use Shopify.  This was my first page to build so I was afraid there would be issues like you noticed, but thank you so much for the feedback.  Building the tap handles was the only part of this venture that I knew how to do before I started., For internal mounting, you\\'ll need a skeleton case, suction mount, and optional audio cable (which, IMHO is not really that \"optional\" since we love hearing cockpit audio!). If you want to shoot through the cockpit window and avoid the rolling shutter effect on the prop, you\\'ll also want to get a neutral density filter of some sort. I recommend RAM mounts - they work great and are pretty interchangeable/flexible. \\n\\nI\\'m in no way affiliated with them but NFlightCam has a [\"cockpit kit\" package](http://nflightcam-com.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/nflightcam-gopro-cockpit-kit) that provides all of these components (not a RAM mount, but their own version I think) along with a nice carrying case at about what they\\'d cost to acquire separately. I picked it up for $99 during a Sun-n-Fun special they were running in April. But, I *think* you can get $20 or $30 off by signing up for their email list or something - no promises, but check their facebook page. \\n\\nTo mount it externally, people use a suction mount and the waterproof case. I\\'ve never gotten up the balls to do this but I think if I did, I\\'d also want to put down some blue painters tape around the base of the suction mount to make sure the air didn\\'t get under it.

Or if you live near a big city, you might be able to call the local PD. They probably have lots of stories about these guys, maybe even down to their shoes.\\n\\nYou could also try searching news articles about guys who are caught this way, and see if the reporter mentions *Stupid McDude was easily caught because he was wearing X shoes, which flash in the dark*.\\n\\nYou can try some alibaba, shopify, ebay, etsy (which isn\\'t what it used to be), rakuten (sp?).\\n\\nI remember those. My mom never let me get a pair. She never let me get the plastic Cinderella high-heel dress up shoes either. Sigh. , So, I think I might be able to help a little bit.\\n\\nShopify, Ebay, Amazon -\\nTo me, these all fit in about the same category, which is a managed store. You don\\'t need a developer, just someone reasonably technically adept to administer them.\\n\\nMagento, Wordpress, Opencart, Zencart -\\nThese are all prebuilt sets of software that you then customize to your needs. Magento and Opencart are e-commerce specific pieces of software. They will do most of what you want out of the box (Products, Shopping Cart, Checkout, basic CRM, etc..), but you will still need a developer to customize them to fit your exact needs.\\n\\nCakePHP, Yii, Laravel, Symfony -\\nPHP frameworks. These provide a basic set of modules to build any kind of website, including e-commerce. They are here to make developers lives easier. For simple projects, or projects with a niche that is not well traveled (unlike e-commerce), these are great.\\n\\nPersonally, I would find someone (if you are dead set on PHP) that specializes with Magento (personal preference, others are just as good). Why pay a dev to re-invent the wheel using CakePHP when there are already solutions out there?, I will only address Canadian startups but obviously Google, Facebook, Amazon etc.... also have Canadians office. This list is non-exhaustive of course.\\n\\nThalmic Labs, Kik, Vidyard, TunnelBear, 500px, D2L, Shopify\\n\\nThere is a bunch of startups in Communitech that are also worth keeping an eye on., [Here](http://vcdl-gear.myshopify.com/products/guns-save-lives-sticker-rolls) you go.

Would love to know if they knew about Cratejoy or Shopify before deciding to roll their own., I would like to ask about the development of your site. Which language and framework did you use to build it? Did you teach yourself programming, or hire someone to build it for you?\\n\\nDid you ever look into using [Cratejoy](http://cratejoy.com), or [Shopify](http://shopify.com/) with a recurring billing plugin? I helped develop a similar subscription site, and was wondering why you didn\\'t choose one of these platforms?\\n, You definitely have to check out [**Three Kingdoms Redux.**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/145371/three-kingdoms-redux) It\\'s an amazing, long, specifically three player game that led to one of the most tense gaming sessions I\\'ve ever had. It\\'s one of only a few 10s in my collection of a few hundred.\\n\\n[Here\\'s a good overview from Rock, Paper, Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/03/24/cardboard-children-three-kingdoms-redux/) and [here is an episode of Heavy Cardboard where they review it.](http://heavycardboard.com/2014/11/19/heavy-cardboard-episode-12-three-kingdoms-redux/) \\n\\nI think right now the best place to buy it is [directly from their website](http://starting-player.myshopify.com/). Despite shipping from Singapore, I received my package (in the continental US) quickly and shipping wasn\\'t terrible, so don\\'t worry if you don\\'t usually order internationally. , I used to push WooCommerce on any of my clients but have made the jump to Shopify for my own store and future clients.\\n\\nThe problem I noticed with other platforms such as 3dcart, bigcommerce, opencart, etc is that they do not have the best integrations with other companies. \\n\\nShopify on the other hand is so popular and IMO, just about any third party service will have integrations for Shopify (since they know its one of the easiest platforms to get started on)., Take two months to learn HTML + CSS if you\\'re serious about being an entrepreneur. Liquid is just shopify\\'s templating language so it\\'s useless outside of Shopify. It\\'s also based on Ruby, which is a nice scripting language to learn.\\n\\nI would draw out what you want your page to look like, then learn HTML + CSS to modify an existing page from a theme that already has the skeleton built.\\n\\n, The packaging of Lip Tars makes sense, though. They\\'re way more intense than a liquid lipstick and you would use WAY too much product if that were the packaging. I remember a while ago they changed to the current squeezy-tubes because people would use the old [squeezy lip gloss style tubes](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0317/5789/products/LipBalmTubeWedge1080.jpg?v=1389009657) and complain that it was difficult to apply, too goopy, etc. Plus a major draw to them is mixing colors, which would be SO SO difficult with a doe-foot tube., I think one way that you can approach it is by using more angular, sharp shapes in your accessories.\\n\\nI have a fairly round face myself, and I\\'m also Asian, so to give a better contrasted look I like pieces like triangle earrings. Here are some examples [1](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/1d/4c/f0/1d4cf0dc57b6d40df6e3c70754aa02e2.jpg) [2](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110302020133/ladygaga/images/6/66/Triangle_Earrings.png) [3](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0178/7331/products/tripple_triangle_earring_gold_940x940.png?v=1398250657)\\n\\nSpiked shapes in a bib necklare are another way you can go. [1](http://www.desnyjewelrymanufacturer.com/upfile/20140728111403106.jpg) [2](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0374/0213/products/JWNK0001W-GD-O_3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1411432158) \\n\\nI think these pieces work because they\\'re bold, which shows a more assertive point of view fashion-wise, and they\\'ve got lots of sharp edges, which can subconsciously make you seem less soft and approachable. \\n\\nBold lipstick colors can also have this effect. Colors like these [1](http://thriftedandmodern.com/sites/default/files/wp_uploads/2011/06/42.jpg) [2](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q3wi2rEveUM/U0pTyFeKSCI/AAAAAAAADAo/4aL5ssSFNTQ/s1600/DSCN3441+copy.jpg) [3](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WU5uvPc749E/Tmmgot5aGBI/AAAAAAAAC2k/zBjQ8WZ11jA/s640/sept8%252C11%252C5.jpg) are a little confrontational because they\\'re so far from natural, which makes them feel more edgy instead of cute., Luckily I have a EG piece just like the ones you linked except they\\'re olive ripstop. Also could I integrate some streetwear-esque pieces like this [knomadik henley](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/1671/products/DP-DENIM-10822.jpg?v=1432970237)? , I have you down to be notified for Round 2. At that point, I\\'ll probably have a store on Shopify set up. :), [I think he means like in Football] (http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0207/4474/products/Patriots_auth_speed_1024x1024.jpg)\\n\\nThis is a football helm(et).\\n\\nOn the item is a rendition of an exceptionally designed image of a human. The image is the symbol of the Patriots, the best NFL team. It is made from plastic., I would look at shopify themes on ThemeForest. They have some Amazon-esque ones there. Good luck!, /FindlayH Now that you have been using CrateJoy for a while now, has the management system improved? \\n\\nI ask because I was thinking about starting up a sub box company as well for a different industry and I\\'ve been on the fence from Shopify, BigCommerce and CrateJoy. I hear having Apps for the shops help in many aspects but was wondering if CrateJoy had any good ones at this point, comparable to Shopify. \\n\\nAlso, when using an ecommerce company for a web page, are you still designing the web page from a free/paid theme and have your shop on a sub-domain? Never completely understood that.\\n, In terms of activation, they are legally heavily restricted across the world, but they do promote the relationship in a big way in Monaco through above the line advertising (roadside bill board advertising). \\n\\nThey mainly use it for guest management in the paddock. Ferrari has two motorhomes in the paddock and one is for Ferrari team personnel, drivers and media. The other is for Marlboro (PMI) and their guests. They have all their cigarettes neatly laid out on each table with lighters and imagery everywhere. You can take packets away with you if you are a smoker.\\n\\nTake a look at this [picture] (https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0704/4789/files/2014-07-26-15.15.17.jpg?1199) I took in the Hungary paddock.

So, Python.\\n\\nRuby is a great language which is properly structured and has a wealth of projects built beneath it.  I think Django (for Python) is ok, but I don\\'t think it has as much in the way of web development as Ruby on Rails does.  Specifically, [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/) was built with Ruby.\\n\\nHowever, if you don\\'t plan on doing web development primarily; Python makes sense for a lot of things.  It\\'s backed by a lot of important institutions (not the least of which is Google) and as a result, everything has been field tested ad nauseam.  More to the point, as a Python developer, part of your resume includes opening a GitHub page &amp; contributing to open source projects.  So there\\'s a wealth of community effort who are contributing because the culture of the project suggests that it\\'s self serving.  Beyond that, the packages built &amp; upgraded are used by important institutions like NASA &amp; CERN.  So it\\'s not just *a* swiss army knife.  It\\'s *the* swiss army knife used by some of the top institutions.\\n\\nBut if you\\'re not going to do complicated analytics either (which you might not) you might be swayed for the same simple reasons I was swayed.\\n\\n1) Everything is easy enough.  Multi threading was a daunting task for me.  I got to Python &amp; it feels idiot-simple.\\n\\n2) There is information to get started on just about everything.  Every kind you want from youtube to books to written tutorials.\\n\\n3) There are several vibrant forums available. , [Tape them to the cat](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/7882/products/eyes_1024x1024.jpg) - The Oatmeal, [New coffee table](http://imgur.com/a/qFxTO)\\n\\nEdit; also literally just snagged a [navy Velva Sheen tee](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0624/0605/products/NOTRE-CHICAGO-VELVA-SHEEN-PIGMENT-SS-CREW-NECK-TEE-WITH-POCKET-NAVY-1.jpg?v=1432584199), Oh man that nail is called Frankenstein.

Most people with something like shopify will use it as a full site as will CJ users but we wanted our site to look and act a certain way that was easier for us to do in WP., 1) I would assume that most people do this as a source of supplemental income at first and try to automate as much as possible... What tasks do you spend the majority of your time on?\\n\\nWe actually started our site ([Hustleandgrind.co](https://hustleandgrind.co/)) as a full business not a side project. My Partner /u/rsimmonds runs a marketing company and brought me in to focus on this project. Most of our time is spent growing the brand via marketing and finding awesome stuff for the boxes. \\n\\n\\n2) How did you finance your launch? Pre-order? (seems ideal) - or did you purchase the box\\'s contents up front?\\nWe actually financed this with savings and did no pre-orders, we bought a lot of goods up front but if I had toi do it again I would actually order on each new round of boxes.\\n\\n\\n3) If you\\'re shipping a unique box every month, then your profit margins would vary from month to month wouldn\\'t they? Do you have a fixed price / budget that you work within for each month\\'s box?\\n\\nWe do have a fixed budget for each box and know that on occarion we are going over it to build the brand knowing that in the future we can get better piricing as we grow the user base and our buying power.\\n\\n\\n4) How many customers did you launch with? How many did you grow that number to?\\n\\nWe launched with no customers but did a prelauncher that allowed us to collect emails from interested parties. \\n\\n\\n5) What was the most challenging aspect for getting your business launched? Pricing? Sourcing product? The idea?\\n\\nPricing has been our biggest thing, we want to make profits good but always keep the customer in mind as we want them to get the best value for what they are spending.\\n\\n\\n6) Unless your providing products at a discounted price - How did you add value to justify the cost?\\n\\nWe select goods that we can get at a good price but we look at it as added value in that we are vetting the goods in each box. If we wouldn\\'t use it, it doesn\\'t go in the box. \\n\\n\\n7) What were your profit margins when you started and what are they now? If they increased - what did you do to increase them?\\n\\nWe are actually only on our second box but we have seen that the increase comes from getting samples in the box or in driving down the price with an increased buying power of a large user base.\\n\\n\\n8) Did you have a technical background when you started or did you hack it together at first?\\nWe hired someone to build our site, I have a tech background but only got into coding in the last year so it was more efficent to hire out and focus on my core skills.\\n\\n9) What\\'s one of the most valuable lessons you\\'ve learned?\\nThat you don\\'t open and it all works. Shit breaks or goes wrong and you need to deal with it all. Adding to that the customers don\\'t just show up because you have launched, you need to hunt them.\\n\\n\\n10) Would you have done anything differently?\\nI would have put our single product store in shopify instead of WooCommerce., You can use the typical arrow keys but when I did play on keyboard I liked to mirror the [hitbox](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0166/4408/products/N8_1024x1024.jpg?v=1353971348) style layout.\\n\\nA, S and D are left, down and right and Space bar is up.

Losing the Sonics killed my enjoyment of the NBA., I believe shopifys premium account has real time shipping calculators built in.

I can ship quite a few targets for that $15 so I think it\\'s just an easy way to handle it and probably how I will too. For the items that I know will take an entire box by themselves I may include a little extra in the price and ship them for free.

Modern web shop systems divorces look and feeel (themes or templates) from the system which runs the functionality (WooCommerce plugin on Wordpress blogs, Virtuemart Component on Joomla content systems; pure shop systems like Magento, Prestashop or hosted solutions like Shopify, BigCommerce, Etsy). If you want a shop that you don\\'t need to magane the technology behind, go for a hosted solution. If you want to delve a little more and know Wordpress try WooCommerce. If you have a larger system think about Virtuemart, or Prestashop, if you\\'re looking for something larger again look into Magento. , Hi!

I know cash is tight at new businesses, so I\\'ve taken the route of going as inexpensive as possible.\\n\\nA few things off hand:\\n\\n1) Your website has a **lot** of room for improvement. It looks like it was made in 2003 and that tells me that you don\\'t care about how you talk about your product. A good website doesn\\'t have to cost a lot of money (shopify, magneto, bigcommerce, etc) and you can hire an Indian or Chinese guy on odesk for like $8/hr to build the whole thing.\\n\\n2) When you are serious about your product, make that reflect in the photography. All of the pictures you have look like they were stock from whoever you import from on Alibaba.

I look at the front page and after 30 seconds (wayyy too long) I still am kinda unsure about what you sell. Instead of making me click 3 times to navigate to a picture, on the front page show a picture of a bunch of red/green bottles (unlabeled) and then an arrow pointing to the new way your bands show (\"Wow I can tell that one red is cranberry, one is bloody mary, one is pomegranate, and one green is marg mix, one is pure lime, one is... etc)\\n\\n4) This lands in the category of \"Maybe this would help...but whatever\". Restaurant managers (your clients) work 80 hour weeks and don\\'t want to spend more time trying to learn about your business. To solve those worries, put a \"Happy Customers!\" or \"Successful Cases!\" etc and show how they improved their mispour (you spelled it miss-pour on your site) and how they can get a bartender up to speed in 3 days instead of 3 weeks and because of how easy it is their turnover has dropped X%.\\n\\n5) Just streetview\\'d your address, get a PO box man, looks like you don\\'t work for a startup, this is just a thing you are trying in your free time at your house...which explains the professionalism of the site.\\n\\n6) Your logo isn\\'t good. You don\\'t need one right now, because there\\'s much more pressing issues to handle before your logo will start to matter.

Nextopia works with Bigcommerce and in my company we\\'ve used it to circumvent the lack of product attributes. It\\'s kinda piecemeal but it works well for us. Also, why Shopify and not Magento? If you want to go enterprise (which it looks like you absolutely can with your growth) Magento will have the highest end tie-ins and sleekest plugins.\\n\\nI just got back from IRCE and being reminded how much there is to implement. I would *highly* recommend attending if you haven\\'t already., For a online store as mature as your\\'s I would say Shopify is not the platform you should adopt.  Shopify will not be suitable for the growth you\\'ve been encountering and you will quickly be in the same position you are currently in with Big commerce.  Shopify is a great platform for starting up your site and gaining traction, but with a mature website like your\\'s, you would have already outgrown it.\\n\\nYou\\'ll find that you have to start resorting to \"hacks\" and odd workarounds to achieve some basic things like product discounts and bundles, among other needs.  With product discounts specifically, they have nothing within Shopify core for this so the workarounds for plugins and apps is to duplicate the products on your site, which is a nightmare when you have 1000s of sku\\'s suddenly being duplicated.  To edit the product you have to disable these discounts or they loose sync with each other.   You can\\'t edit the checkout process and tweak it, you are stuck with the same checkout as every shopify user.  It\\'s not a bad checkout, you just can\\'t customize it.  \\n\\nAlso, most importantly you need to make sure Shopify will allow you to sell your type of product on their platform.  They do have restricted items and I believe your product could be in a grey area.  \\n\\nSince you have a web developer on staff you would be wise to choose a fully open source platform that you can fully control, like Magento.  Magento has a steep learning curve, but once your dev learns it you will have a platform that you can build on for years.\\n\\nIf you have any questions on Shopify and various ecom platforms feel free to message me as I have a lot of experience with them.\\n\\n, Hi! Scrolled every page of your site and read every comment of this thread! Serious congrats on the achievement!!

My main concerns would be the quality.  What fabrics, sewing techniques and warranty come with these?  I wear ties/bowties and I definitely wouldn\\'t do a subscription plan.  Ties are personal and usually the consumer likes picking them out.  \\n\\nMy recommendation is set up a store at Shopify.com.  Make some ties, and get on instagram and pinterest.  Take shots with a good mobile phone, iPhone6 maybe?, and highlight the \"lifestyle\".  Look at how brands project a lifestyle to attract the ideal consumer.  Give some of these away to fashion bloggers in exchange for an article write up.  The competition is fierce, you may want to look at going to the Magic even in New York and Vegas to sell these at whole sale/bulk.

I wonder if it\\'s a coinsidence that shopify is going public around the time that all these case studies are coming out., As a fellow mixologist and someone who has been in the industry for a couple years, I would recommend starting with a proper business plan. A business plan will answer questions you would have never thought of and make sure your business model is correct.\\n\\nSome things specific to to running an eliquid company are:\\n\\nLiability insurance\\n\\nBottle, vg, pg, nic, label and flavor vendors\\n\\nA clean room. IE positive pressure hepa filtered room and work towards at least an ISO6 certificate.\\n\\nA good website. I recommend shopify\\n\\nA graphic artist for logo, website and label\\n\\nMaking flavors that people will like. Make sure to get people to test them and give feedback. The more the better.\\n\\nBut before any of this, a good business plan., Yes I have tried Commerce Kickstart. The problem is that building a new site in Drupal 7 with Commerce will be very hard to upgrade to drupal 8, and how long will drupal 7 be supported from now on? Not sure, 4 or 5 years max I guess. And then what, you\\'ve built your business up around a product that was already well out of date when you started. I\\'m just suggesting that if all you need is a webshop then there are probably other frameworks to use that are more relevant and that aren\\'t built around a php4 architecture.\\n\\nTake something like shopify, purpose built webshop, really easy to theme, $25 a month for the basic package. Webshop up and running in... an hour or 2, earning money by next week. Developing a custom drupal webshop takes time, and costs money, and will always require a paid developer to add features, fix bugs, perform security upgrades, etc.\\n\\nIf you want a community, or a big forum, or some other CMS functionality, or you want to extend an existing drupal site with a webshop, then yeah Drupal 7 rocks. , Good list here OP.

Software as a service will always be cheaper because every single bug fix and upgrade can be spread across every client. But its not because it is a \"purpose built webshop\" but its because it is a software as a service product where you will have no custom code.\\n\\nAs soon as you have any custom code your price will massively sky rocket. It\\'s nothing to do with \"drupal\" just the difference between owning your own code or not.\\n\\nHowever, Shopify will also be unflexible. It will only work if it does exactly what you need but you can\\'t customise it beyond what you need. If you need any custom features or custom ways of displaying things unique to your business then you\\'re going to have to go for some software you can customise yourself. It doesn\\'t matter if its a \"purpose built webshop\" (virtue mart, magento) or drupal commerce, its gonna cost more but its also going to be essential.\\n\\nThe drupal 8 thing is a red herring. If you are starting a business around ecommerce and it wont bring in enough money to refresh the core technology in 4-5 years then its probably not that great a business. If the business is so niche you can\\'t use shopify then definitely you probably shouldn\\'t do the business.\\n\\nIts about customisability not added features, its things like doing downloads, or user dashboard, or interesting analytics, or special reports that make drupal special. Not things like \"other CMS functionality\" or \"big forum\" as if you needed that you could get Shopify + Wordpress, phpbb, etc (Also drupal is pretty terrible for forums now), cream of sumyounguy\\n\\nedit: does it help if just say cum of young brad pitt in fight club?

They ALL drop ship. Keep in mind they are approached ALL THE TIME to drop ship for people wanting to start their own business. The sales reps can not give good pricing for your to compete without getting approval to put you on a better/custom pricing program, and for them to do this they put their reputation on the line believing in you and your business. \\n\\n2. Margins SUCK. We had GREAT shipping discounts with FedEx. No oversize fees, dimensional factor of 275, etc. Could ship a 60lb hitch from Texas to NY for $15. This is a huge influence on competing or not competing.\\n\\n3. Start with products they are tough to find locally but easy to install in your driveway, these sell much better.\\n\\n4. Specialize. Chances are your product is available on Amazon with Prime 2 day shipping. If there is no reason to buy from you, then customers wont buy from you. If you are one of the 1000s of bigcommerce,shopify,typical hosted Automotive drop ship companies out there with no competitive advantage, you will be very sad:(.

Just go search Google for \"shopify vs\" or \"bigcommerce vs\" etc... you will find plenty of ecommerce platforms to review., Making your own ranch is super easy, and super affordable!\\n\\nI use about 80% sour cream, 20% heavy whipping cream. I don\\'t know the exact proportions, but it needs: onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper (prefer cracked), salt, dill weed, parsley.\\n\\nI\\'ve made it with 70% sour cream, 30% buttermilk, and it was delicious. The only problem is buttermilk is a bit expensive and I can never manage to finish a container because, by itself, buttermilk is disgusting.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried various versions of scratch ranch dressing, and I don\\'t personally care for mayonnaise versions, versions with vinegar, or versions with Worcestershire/hot sauce.\\n\\nThis one is pretty basic, just sub out the ratios I mentioned for the base and I guarantee you\\'ll love it.

Now, MSG is delicious, don\\'t get me wrong, but honestly, scratch ranch is better anyway (in my opinion). The Marie\\'s brand doesn\\'t have MSG, and is actually quite good, but I still prefer my own ranch. I\\'m not sure whether or not MSG produces any real reactions in people, or if it\\'s just a psychological issue, but I do know free glutamates act as excitotoxins and I just avoid it because there\\'s no reason not to.

Somehow I don\\'t think shopify will handle my needs. , Just be aware that magento is usually aimed at more corporate applications for those with deeper pockets.

You can set that to anything you\\'d like, including pounds. You can mix and match variants and options easily to let the customer pick just what they want. \\n\\nIn Shopify I know you can display the quantity as a number with no unit, and just add the unit right after the dropdown on the page itself. Perhaps you could do this on Bigcommerce as well?, Another thing to keep in mind is that Shopify has twenty four hour support. If you get stuck try giving them a call. I\\'ve used them for several clients now and I\\'ve had a pleasant experience each time. , Shopify can do that with variants.\\n\\nVariants are per product and allow you to enter the variant name.

These are Magento and Shopify. \\n\\nMagento is an open-source solution which would probably require the help of Magento developers to deploy. After that you\\'ll own the store and won\\'t need to pay for anything unless you decide to expand, redesign or add more features to the store for which you\\'ll have to hire help. So you\\'ll have to make one major investment to have the store up and running. Other expenditures would be needed if you require paid extensions to automate your eCommerce processes, although Magento offers lots of free extensions.\\n\\nShopify is a hosted eCommerce solution which means it\\'s easy and fast to set up even by your own, but you\\'ll have to pay a monthly fee for using the system. Moreover, you\\'ll have to pay a monthly fee also for each add-on you\\'ll need to install in the course of running your business. \\n\\nYou can learn more about pros and cons of two most popular eCommerce solution in our recent article: [Magento vs. Shopify.

I hear all the time about how people are so happy with what I can do at $30 a month, and then when asked to add up their addon prices, it works out to $90 or more a month. I\\'m a big fan of Squarespace because it\\'s $30 monthly and never more, and it has all the major integrations built right in. My major gripe is it doesn\\'t handle PayPal or Bitcoin and doesn\\'t have abandoned cart tools, Heard bad things about Volusion recently - and they\\'re running Google Adwords to try and divert Shopify searchers - a sign perhaps that they\\'re panicking a bit?!\\n\\nI\\'ve done a couple of Shopify sites for clients - very painless and support is fantastic.

Very easy to use and customize., Genuinely quite like it - I don\\'t think TW Steel deserve to be disregarded - a lot of their designs are actually really nice and unique - I used to own the [Blue Pilot](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0226/0695/products/tw406F_large.jpg?v=1379905859) and the only reason I sold it was because of my infatuation with a sweeping seconds hand, Magento is terrible on anything but a dedicated server.   Volution charges for traffic overage.  \\n\\nShopify is the way I would go.  , Alright, here\\'s my assessment. Sorry in advance for being blunt.\\n\\nFirst off the website: As said here before, your choice of colour and design is questionable and I guess a matter of (subjective) taste. It is just not for me. It all screams \"bling and style\" and not \"outdoors, or wilderness\" as you would like me to believe.\\n\\nAlso, your legal info is just a mess. It all seems copied and pasted from different shops (I guess from shopify) and all in all does not give me confidence in your webshop as a whole. Your Terms&amp;Conditions and Returns Policies are what matter to me, those directly affect me as a customer. \\n\\nAlso I find it weird that you have five different social media accounts set up, but you\\'re only selling 4 different backpacks. I guess that can change over time, but it makes me question your focus.\\n\\nOn to the backpacks: The colour choice, once again, is not my taste. I get what you\\'re trying to do here, but it\\'s just not for me. On the plus side, I\\'m willing to bet that these packs will sell like crazy on the Asian market, especially Japan and Hongkong. \\n\\nThe design of the packs is shabby at best, sorry. Once again, I get what you\\'re trying to do here and I\\'m applauding your \"Ray Jardine - Revisionism\", but we\\'ve come a long way since the old RayWay-packs design-wise and it shows here. There are sooooooo many companies and cottages having superior packs in the same weight and volume range, granted, for more money, but with far more and better features. There\\'s a reason why you don\\'t see RayWay packs anymore. Plus, why shouldn\\'t I just buy a backpack-kit from Ray himself, seeing as he is the original creator of these types of backpacks? \\n\\nHave you thought about the legal implications of your design? Especially since you don\\'t even hide the fact that these packs are basically RayWay-packs?\\n\\nThe construction of the backpacks looks really bad, I\\'m sorry. When I\\'m able to see fraying edges (on your shoulder-straps) and terrible, crooked seam-lines (once again the shoulder-straps) on your MAIN PRODUCT PHOTOS, I don\\'t want to know what I\\'ll be able to find when I\\'m actually holding one of these in my hands. Overall poor sewing shows poor care in the design process, which usually results in ripped seams and poor performance. \\nAt the very least singe the edge of your material, so it doesn\\'t fray and then properly hem your edges. And if you\\'re not able to produce straight seams, for the love of christ, DON\\'T USE NEON-COLOURED THREAD!\\n\\nAll in all, it seems like you rushed into this. Maybe consider going back to the drawing board, come up with something fresh, improve on your workmanship (sew, sew, sew, sew and then sew some more) and relaunch in a couple of months? It shows potential, especially since you\\'d be serving a sort of underrepresented niche in the UL market with your bright and colourful design (think PicharPak Workshop). But atm there is just nothing to back your claims up, sorry.\\n\\nEDIT: spelling, Go with a das keyboard m8: http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0152/0433/products/Cartoon_Heropage_1024x1024.jpg?v=1374095644, Wow, this is awesome.  Thank you for taking the time to provide such a thoughtful answer!  I\\'m definitely going to be reading all this stuff on marketing.\\nI\\'m struggling with even the basic mechanics of how to set up a proper page that highlights the product and how to do the payments.  \\n\\nI looked at Shopify but feel that using it would be taking a sledge hammer when all I really have to drive is a finishing nail.

They make selling online way simpler, even than shopify. Once you setup your product there you can embed code on your page and have a product payment overlay show up.\\n, Question- It was loosely covered in the video,but if you\\'re using Shopify should you be submitting your website in google webmaster tools so it can be crawled? , &gt; The company has always taken the \\'easy way out\\' when it comes to Tech. For example: we use Shopify as an ecommerce platform and try to build out features that the platform can\\'t handle.\\n\\nThere is a fine line between \"not invented here\" and \"taking the easy way out\".  Only you can be the real judge on this one but keep in mind there is absolutely nothing wrong with using or paying for tech that helps a company toward its goal.  Are the features you are trying to build really outside of what Shopify can handle or is it just difficult to implement?\\n\\n\\n&gt; There is no formal testing. Ever. My coworker will click through a feature of mine to check for abnormalities and then its up on the site live the next second.\\n\\nThis is more common than coding bootcamps lead people to believe.  Testing is a great skill and should definitely be applied more than it is - but it is only one tool in a toolbox, not a way of life.  It works well for some companies, not as well for others.  I won\\'t say don\\'t stick to your beliefs if you really believe in it, but be prepared to limit yourself to only the places that make testing a top priority.\\n\\n&gt; My boss will often throw out ideas with no follow up: \\'we should have code reviews\\', \\'we should build this from scratch\\', etc.\\nI am often left alone to build features to completion with no help from my boss (mostly because he is unfamiliar or unaware of the technology).\\n\\nThis is just lazy or timid management, and also happens quite frequently.  Perhaps he\\'s looking for some discussion on the matter - does anyone pipe up and say \"hey that\\'s a great idea\" or \"no, that sounds awful\" when he brings these topics up?  Try showing him you looked into it and found something like [Review Board](https://www.reviewboard.org/) and compare/contrast it with Github issues.\\n\\n&gt; I am the only person on the team with working knowledge of Git &amp; version control. I had to go teach Git workflow and how to use GitHub to both the Director of IT as well as the other developers on the team (who were hired around the same time as me).\\n\\nNo VCS is definitely a red flag to me.  Not having a solid Git workflow I am a bit more forgiving of, most of the companies I\\'ve walked into haven\\'t had a solid one down pat before I joined.  But not using it at all is a definite concern to me, especially for a startup here in the valley.\\n\\n**TL;DR**\\n\\nIt sounds like the bootcamp has convinced you that their methodology (TDD, tech stack, write everything yourself, etc) is The One Way™.  This is common for college grads and bootcamp grads alike - I would keep an open mind and at least give some different ways a chance.  It will be a long and arduous career if you are only accepting of people and companies that do it your way.  You will find out after several years that there are many right ways of attacking problems and just because you once used a language or tool that worked well doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s better., You can also try a [lucky iron fish](http://lucky-iron-fish.myshopify.com/products/lucky-iron-fish). , There\\'s some ecommerce fraud solutions that prevent this kind of thing from happening.

It doesn\\'t really matter exactly where you go for undergrad THAT much. It helps to be at one of the big name schools like waterloo or UofT, but there are more important things.

Shopify is SO much better. Better app ecosystem,  support, and their liquid code is pretty robust. Highly recommended and I wish I started with Shopify in the first place. \\n\\nShopify site: www.popovleather.com \\n\\nBig commerce: www.popovleather.ca \\n\\nWill be moving or axing the Canadian site soon. \\n\\nWhat really bothered me,  apart from their abysmal infrastructure,  was their non existent communication. I have had plenty of examples in the past where customers would contact me about our site being down,  etc. only to learn it was a wide ranging issue by seeing complaints in the BC forums. \\n\\nHonestly,  spend some time in the BC forums and read all the hostility from some store owners. It\\'s a huge red flag. , [theprintful](https://www.theprintful.com/) or  [printaura](http://www.printaura.com/#_a_37)  are  the two most established I think. both have shopify plugins. \\n\\nprintaura tend to be a few dollars cheaper (which matters when you are going this route - your margins are small) but printful are a bit more polished in their setup. don\\'t think you would go wrong with either., How are you creating the website if you\\'re not using Shopify?\\n\\nIf you\\'re building it yourself, or have a developer doing it then it\\'s not overly difficult to integrate [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com),  [Sagepay](http://www.sagepay.com), [WorldPay](http://worldpay.com), [SecureTrading](http://www.securetrading.com/), [Stripe](https://stripe.com) etc. All of these are internet payment gateways that, properly integrated with an e-commerce site can allow for you to securely take payments. I don\\'t think any of these *require* paid accounts (though some have options). \\\\*Though of course they will each take a small % of each sale.\\n\\nSomething like Stripe is probably the easiest., When I was freelancing, I had normally about 3-4 days of work a week. The most important thing to me was making sure I had a full days work every day, 10-6, with no distractions like videogames. Some people can get away with working on an off throughout the week (hell, its the reason a lot of people freelance over working at an agency), but I need the solid days worth of concentration or I wouldn\\'t get anything done all week.\\n\\nI would spend 1 day looking for clients. This was cold calling, visiting local businesses, contacting old clients for more work or if they knew anyone needing any. I also contacted all the local digital media agencies and told them I was a freelancer and while I wasn\\'t looking for a job, I was looking for some freelance work. This was actually advice someone on reddit gave me. Some of the agencies told me to fuck off, but a couple had overflow work that they would outsource to me from time to time.\\n\\nI would spend one day working on personal things (updating my blog, SEO on my website, building small websites for fun) and making Wordpress themes. Wordpress themes are a tricky one. I never made enough money directly from selling themes for it to be worth the time spent on them alone, but they look great on your portfolio, and I made some of them available for free which led traffic to my website. Its hard to quantify how much they brought in from that. A lot of my clients just wanted simple wordpress themes, they would say they downloaded my free one and wanted me to make some changes to suit them. I never got round to it, but I planned on starting doing some Shopify themes too.\\n\\nIf I had any time left, I would start looking at media agencies. I had a bookmark folder full of every agency that I wanted to work for. I was happy freelancing, so I was only going to join an agency that I liked, and at a position I was happy with. Eventually I joined a start up when they had a position open and I\\'m really happy there, though its just as stressful as freelancing.\\n\\nTL,DR. Keep busy. Build your portfolio. Make freebies (themes, plugins) Experiment on your own websites. Look for more work., Great question - I\\'m in a similar position too. I\\'m trying to see how I can get folks to beta test our app that does analytics based on customer segmentation and then push details to email platforms like Mailchimp\\n, Do you have a project/product manager? Make your case to them if you do. \\n\\nIf not, functional requirements are a good start. But hopefully you have more to go off of than as you say:\\n\\n&gt;  push sales, brand awareness and provide a platform to make things happen\\n\\nThe first thing I\\'d ask as a PM would be, \"how many sales do you think this will increase our quarterly sales by?\" \\n\\nFollowed up with, \"how did you arrive at that number?\"\\n\\nThus far I\\'m I\\'ve not given you any advice, just kind of shit on your plan. So here\\'s how to solve that first problem. Get access to your sales tracking and whatever web-traffic analytics you use. \\n\\nThese are great things to know:\\n\\n* Percentage splits of DESKTOP/MOBILE\\n* Which devices are the most commonly used\\n* Splits for abandon shopping carts on mobile vs. desktop\\n* How much time mobile users vs. desktop users spend on the site\\n* How much time it takes to convert a sale on mobile vs. desktop\\n\\nGo into the project by saying, a mobile app would DO X by _____ MEASURABLE VARIABLE.  \\n\\ne.g.: A mobile app would reduce the User\\'s time spent going through the UI by three steps and 3 minutes. We think that we could increase sales on mobile by 30%.\\n\\nHow did you know time and number of steps was such a huge factor in converted sales? Analytics + you surveyed your customers with abandon shopping carts and rewarded their surveys with coupons.\\n\\nBrand awareness is a shaky concept. Did you know that most apps never get downloaded? One thing you\\'ll have to deal with is that an app can cannibalize sales from your desktop User Experience, and again looking at the numbers, your mobile users may be great customers but the desktop Users could spend 2X as much. How do you advertise the app? Through the website mostly. \\n\\nDepending on the strength of your current team is how you should look to move forward. With a strong PM, a UX person, back-end devs, and front-end devs+designers going from mobile-web to mobile-native could be done very cheaply in-house for the most part. You could go off your mobile design and use [Native Script](http://www.telerik.com/nativescript) to use your in-house team to at least get an app done quickly and cheaply. \\n\\nIf you\\'re running a Shopify store, there\\'s an App for that. \\n\\nIf you\\'re running an older bespoke e-commerce site, and your team isn\\'t really technical, you\\'ll probably want to hire a full team. You could spend anywhere from 50K to 200K. And in the end, you could end up with a useless app. Even properly designed apps by legit companies flop. \\n\\nWhat developers constantly preach is trying to get the minimum viable product done, and then seeing if you can get it to where your hopes and dreams were by constantly making it better. If you won\\'t have an active role in working on the app or any of the development besides throwing out ideas at meetings you should read A LOT about this stuff before committing any other type of energy to the project. , Wix and Umbraco are pretty terrible. I\\'ve also run into some problems with Shopify before., I like the design better on the big commerce site. Wasn\\'t a big fan of the big picture at the top appose to the crisp style on the big commerce site. Just some honest feedback but everything else looks really smart and fits well with the niche your in. As a BC customer currently thinking of moving to Shopify i can agree with the forum stuff. Its like a jungle in them forums. Its the small things shopify offers in terms of apps which to the general business owner who cant code can use very easily. , I got mine [here](https://rideit.myshopify.com/collections/all) and it came from canada and the person really gave a fuck about it which was nice.\\n\\nThe shop only has patches now. Not sure what that means. , La Colombe Coffee Roasters from here in Philadelphia recently started [distilling their own rum](http://lacolombedistillery.myshopify.com/products/different-drum) — coffee infused.

With this model, we can give it to them for one upfront fee. The client then owns the site forever., I don\\'t believe stripe is available in New Zealand yet? (Australia yes). Shopify is available. I currently run my website through that with pretty good results - combined with PayPal as I am eagerly awaiting stripe.., From my experience, auto hiding out of stock items on Shopify is not something that is built into the stock platform.

Shopify is available in NZ\\n2. Stripe is not, I would love to discuss your logic for the switch to shopify. If you are happy look/feel/function of an available shopify template, you are right that there is no need for a dev or design resource in house (or on contract).\\n\\nThe moment that you want to make a change to a template, you will need a dev/designer to do that, on Shopify, Magento, or anywhere else.\\n\\nThere are more concerns, and Shopify is a great fit for some businesses for many reasons - but from a big picture resourcing requirment, even a budget perspective, I\\'m curious as to your findings., When you place a bird inside another smaller bird and keep going it\\'s called a turducken  ie turkey with a duck inside roasted with a chicken inside with a quail.

If you want a blog first, that you can add commerce too, that is likely better found elsewhere than either of these vendors., I don\\'t know man, I just graduated with a non-CS STEM degree and I set up my own website for a side business through Shopify. Most successful e-commerce websites follow a simple template, and mine is as generic as it gets.    \\n    \\nIt works. People don\\'t care about a site\\'s bells and whistles. As long as it has that flat, modern UI and you have a great product, you\\'re good to go., I follow the startup world religiously, and almost every thriving startup in recent years has the same, generic template.

Shopify and squarespace are relatively new players, but think about salesforce, office 365, constant contact, etc. I\\'ve been in this industry since 2005/2006, and at the end of the day, the amount of customers that care about end-to-end functionality at the LOWEST up-front prices (versus clients that want to look under the hood) is staggering. Most small businesses don\\'t have a reliable technical guy and don\\'t know anything about this stuff, which is why shopify is now on the NYSE. Companies that do have a technical team or contact will skip right over your products and do it themselves.\\nAlso, you\\'ll find that this model would be like digging in the sand. You\\'ll charge them up front, and offer something that YOU set up (and thus know the most about), and as a result, your customers will want your help with Wordpress upgrades, plugin updates, obsolete plugin replacements, random questions (\"how do I add a product? How do I create a back order?\"), and even customizations (one-size-fits-all sites are NOT the end-all solution for most users). You\\'ll be underwater in weeks if you provide these services for free after the initial payment. And if you decided to charge monthly for it? Well, now you\\'re just a more expensive shopify with a) a product that isn\\'t nearly as robust or stable, and b) an up-front fee that shopify doesn\\'t have. \\nYou could tweak the model by renting servers (with these preconfigured wordpress eCommerce instances) to customers instead, where you\\'d get perpetually reimbursed for continual maintenance/oversight of your product. But alas, you\\'d still end up being a more expensive shopify with a vastly inferior product. Even if you added some novelty - e.g. Allowing customers to take a .zip containing all of the files + their database away at any time (something shopify does not do), it would still be too difficult to compete. Also, that gives customers incentive to leave. \\nSource: web consultant, web developer, software engineer, that has lost several clients to shopify over the last few years\\nEdit: shopify\\'s overall transactional volume gives them EXTREMELY low merchant rates. Their enterprise PCI compliant billing systems are the real deal, and this is extremely attractive to those in need of an eCommerce platform. No matter what you did, you\\'d never be able to compete with that. Wordpress, specifically wordpress eCommerce, is NOT a \"set and forget it\" platform. PCI compliance is expensive and time consuming. , I picked up this bad boy for the abaddon that\\'s coming in!

Ideally you want people to buy from you. Why take them away from browsing your site?, Checked your site out. I\\'d make a purchase (if i was a chick lol). What made you go with a shopify vs their competitors or even a wordpress cart plugin? , Software engineer at Shopify. I\\'ve been doing this for ~12 years now. I love my job, and this is a pretty fantastic place to do it at. , We use Shopify. It is primarily driven to be an eCommerce platform with a Blog as an ancillary service. If you are primarily developing a blog then you should reconsider eCommerce. Or, reconsider your business setup. Perhaps you should have an eCommerce store with a blog as a complimentary service that adds value to your customers and brings them in. The SEO content would serve you better in this respect. Either way, Good luck!, Hey, thanks a lot! Actually, I started with Yahoo! Stores and that was a huge mistake. I shopped around and tried a few other e-commerce hosting sites like GoDaddy, Big Cartel, etc. In all honesty, Shopify is just freaking awesome! Hosting e-commerce stores is all they do, which means no detail was overlooked. Setup is super easy, the tools for designing your website are user-friendly, they have their own payment gateway (not just PayPal), you manage everything in one organized place (i.e. orders, products, payments, shipping, taxes, inventory, reports, design, etc.), your site will be SEO friendly, they give you a 14-free trial, they have tons of free/paid themes and all the themes are responsive and mobile-device friendly. Shopify also post daily blogs that are extremely helpful and the service integrates well with other third party services like Shipwire (for businesses who are looking for an easy way to manage &amp; ship inventory). Everything has just been great so far and I\\'d highly recommend them., Shopify is your best bet. They have tons of 3rd party support, and it can get you off the ground super fast. The transaction fee can be waived if you use their payment gateway, Shopify Payments.\\n\\nAs far as blog functionality, Shopify\\'s is pretty basic. There aren\\'t any built in sharing features, at least with the theme I\\'m using. Perhaps you can keep it on a dedicated blogging platform, and feed it into your Shopify store?, [We\\'ve got a winner](https://brcbstore.myshopify.com/products/br-decal)., There are bookstores that are selective about what they carry all the time.\\n\\nHere\\'s one in my city, it\\'s primarily a progressive, political, rights based ideology focused book store. \\n\\nhttp://bravenewbooks.myshopify.com/, 45/45 \\n\\nbushing seat is compareable to an aera k3.

In my limited research it looks like the minimum tax in CA is $800 and in DE it\\'s $175 - can someone confirm/deny/comment? Also, is that added onto any tax on profits, or is that the minimum if I don\\'t make any profits? Also, how does that work if I record a loss, do I still pay or can I net that out via tax benefit?\\n\\n2) What\\'s the best/cheapest ecommerce site to use? I have been considering Shopify - it seems like a nice setup and it\\'s basically plug and play (so to speak). \\n\\nEDIT: Thought up some new questions...\\n\\n3) Is there another way to figure out viability of the business (re: margins) before I incorporate? All distributors want me to sign up as a vendor - what if I incorporate, sign up, and realize margins are too low to be viable - do I just have to make a leap of faith?\\n\\n4) With that being said, a lot of distributors ask for industry references. I can give them bank references for my accounts, etc (I\\'m personal friends with my banker). But in the industry I will be new as a dropshipper, will people still do business with me? If I\\'m paying with a CC does that even matter because I\\'m not getting net terms?\\n\\n5) Do banks usually extend credit cards to new businesses? I should know this as I have worked in banking.

Their liquid layouts mean any E-commerce specialist can come in and make their mods, improving all your pages, product pages, or category pages in one hit, and they can be used to style, or DOM specific pages. \\n\\nOne thing I would change is to get better, or standard sized images for the front-image at least, that can add a visual balance. Also ensure that you are using micro-formatted data. Shopify default themes come with this, but in my business experience, it\\'s broken, so you need to fix it, so google, bing etc can see your products, testimonials and reviews, as well as business opening hours, contact details and sadly address (seems to be missing details, even a PO Box is better than nothing). Btw I &lt;3 the map, keep it.\\n\\nLastly, you need to better communicate why to buy from your business, and then to drive traffic; you seem more expensive than some vendors, so I would explain why (HQ parts, expert labour etc)., (This is not us) but it sort of inspired us.

Your issue seems to be with the implementation of the software. There are numerous add-on apps in the Shopify App that can alert you of low inventory. Set the thresholds based on sales history and lead times.\\n\\nHave you set up [inventory tracking](https://docs.shopify.com/manual/your-store/products/track-inventory) in Shopify? It\\'s pretty straight forward. \\n\\nIf you are in the field or just away from your computer, think about investing in a tablet. You can just log into your store admin panel and adjust inventory when a sale is made or inventory is added.\\n\\nYou need to make sure inventory is checked in, out and rotated. Changing your software will not change the end result is you aren\\'t putting in the necessary data.\\n\\nSince you have barcodes, maybe a scanner gun will make it a little easier for you. I\\'m not sure if it will be worth it for 90 SKUs.\\n\\nI would not invest in software until you have truly outgrown Shopify. I know running a business is difficult but you need to put procedures in place that will make it easier.\\n\\nYou may also want to hire someone to create a custom Excel spreadsheet. We do this even when we are using SAP. Have them create macros that will automatically export your data from Shopify and import it into Excel. \\n\\nWe typically color code the cells when we need to be alerted to low inventories or if there close dated product. You just need to run the spreadsheet daily and scroll through your SKU list. No colored cells, no worries.\\n\\nThere is an investment in time on the front end, but it will make your business easier to manage in the long run., [If he wanted to win, he had little choice but to toss a perfect game](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0285/9256/products/koufax_002_b1230457-cdfe-4575-bc91-e5dbaf25b86f_1024x1024.png?v=1393066681)\\n\\nEdit: BTW the one hit didn\\'t figure in the run being scored  , You make a good point!  \\n\\nEDIT:  [This guy!](http://alive-well-2.myshopify.com/products/206-beanie) , Thanks!

They apply that to out of state LLCs operating in the state too so you can\\'t just go elsewhere. I believe it\\'s 10% of profits with a minimum of $800 so losses won\\'t reduce that. Ask an accountant to be sure.\\n\\n2) Best/cheapest is going to vary all over the place depending on what you do and what you like. Shopify is popular and seems to work. I\\'d do a cursory review and pick one of the top ones rather than making it a major element of the business. I could get screwed that way but if so then so are millions of other businesses.\\n\\n3) Could you simply sign up as a sole proprietorship and then re-sign up as an LLC? If not then you\\'re stuck searching for pricing in comments which is not going to be fun or accurate. \\n\\n4) I\\'ve had little difficulty signing up in the past. They want to make sure you\\'re not a fraud and that you will generate enough business to make it worth making an account but the CC helps.\\n\\n5) Personal guarantees do wonders if your credit is good. Outside that they do issue debit cards. Without proof of stability and revenue credit cards are not going to have high limits even if they will issue them. Perhaps your banker friend can help?\\n\\n, You have to learn how to get punched in the face over and over. Welcome to life post high school. 4 times is nothing. \\n\\nIf you really do \"want a decent paying job\" the minimum wage work is not going to help you much in the long run - ESPECIALLY if you aren\\'t going to college. It makes sense to add it to the resume for work experience - but i\\'d recommend learning graphic design, learn how to sell things online with something like shopify (even if it\\'s to your friends). Being entrepreneurial is one of the most important things you can develop. It will also help you learn how to get punched in the face.\\n\\nLearn how to be scrappy, get punched in the face, and some hard skills like coding or self-created sales experience. \\n\\nTo put things in perspective check this out: https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/what-i-did-after-getting-rejected-by-my-dream-companies-d26231a91b63, [What do YOU mean lawn people?](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0205/1522/products/gnomescarface2crop_large.jpg?v=1395954863), I apply over at Shopify periodically. I\\'ll get in one day!, [PIOYWL](https://homestore-runner.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/trogdor-shirt?variant=959004872), does WL support homestore-runner.myshopify.com, If you do not want to maintain the infrastructure ( including PCI compliance ) I would pick Shopify over the other solutions. They have an API you can integrate with and it is fully hosted on their platform.\\n\\nEDIT: Given http://www.shopify.com/pricing if you spend more than 1 hour per month maintaining it yourself, Shopify will be cheaper., What online CMS will you be using? For a small company that is an important aspect since it will cost money integrating the systems. I chose to use Shopify since there are a bunch of fulfillment centers that you can start using right away. *not affiliated with Shopify in any way* I think Wordpress has a bunch of fulfillment options that are plug and play as well., Depends what you plan on doing with your website and features you need. A lot of Content Management Systems (CMS) incorporate hosting as well. Squarespace and Shopify are two big ones that offer hosting plans. Wordpress is a another big CMS but you need to purchase your own hosting (i\\'d recommend host gator). I\\'d recommend wordpress if you are not planning on doing ecommerce (although it definitely can be used for ecommerce)., I personally used a mixture of PPC Hero blog posts and CPC Strategy\\'s guide to Google Shopping.\\n\\nUnfortunately, PPC Hero changed their blog design and I find it almost impossible to use, so I just stopped visiting altogether.\\n\\nIf you\\'re on Shopify, the app they created is FANTASTIC for managing shopping feeds., [Uwotm8?](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0161/4304/products/fucknwa_mockup_1024x1024.jpg?v=1403314393), I work remotely and needed a change of scenery. I had a one way ticket to London and then, a week before I was supposed to leave, met someone in Mexico that lured me to Los Angeles. Considering the weather in December —\\xa0it wasn\\'t a hard sell. Snagged a one way ticket, hopped a plane with two duffel bags, and lived in Venice a few months before finding a place in Marina del Rey.\\n\\nRegarding capital investment, the goal was to do it for less than $500. I was actually able to do it for $29 as the only hard cost was the Shopify subscription. The designs are type based (most of the effort there is coming up with the ideas... so I suppose you could count my booze and weed for that process as a capital investment). The manufacturing is done by a service called Printful (shown in the tutorial) that pulls orders from the Shopify store, manufactures on demand, and drop ships to the customer. It\\'s rather fucking magical. I just created an account and started marketing on instagram twenty-nine minutes ago —\\xa0one post, nineteen likes, two comments (links directly to the store)., If your use case is simple enough to be doable with Shopify, then use Shopify. Won\\'t get easier than that.\\n\\nOtherwise accept that there\\'s no \"work right out of the box\" and pick the solution with the best developer experience, and that\\'s Sylius., I agree. Target some influencers that would benefit from your offering. Give them some sort of incentive for referring business and even run a contest to drive traffic to your site.

I can see the relevance of ordering from an American brand for clothing as opposed to a Chinese supplier due to the location.\\n\\nThanks, Well, should you be investing in wheat, corn, lentils, rice, or canola right now?

What I have been doing now is that I keep track of the full boxes and I just take one out when shopify inventory is low; shopify inventory then gets the amount of items from that box added, 12, 24, 36, 10... , [relevant](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0059/1872/products/Pet_Peeve_large.png?v=1432658542), No, not really.  You\\'ll have to learn a basic web framework like rails or sinatra after that, which would also require learning a bit about databases. And a layout framework like bootstrap. Are you planning on implementing the ordering page or is that already something online? If you wanted to make an ordering site, then you\\'ll have to learn about security to protect credit cards.  And some payment system.  At this point, why not just use something like Shopify.com?\\n\\nI would say all this effort would be more worth it if you plan on keep writing code as a parallel hobby for the foreseeable future.  Otherwise it would be like me saying I want to manage bees and produce honey because I have a website that could really use a product to sell., I have this up:\\nhttp://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/6917/products/procrastinationdemotivator.jpeg?v=1416776298, I don\\'t believe so because their towels fold like regular towels, as you can see on the [photos](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0163/0290/products/IMG_0006-4_grande.jpg?v=1428502158) in the webshop, whereas mat-towel combo\\'s like the ones in the opening text [roll up](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/08/66/e6/0866e674ca4106bb392c9586da766a47.jpg)  like a mat since the rubber bottom doesn\\'t fold., in Shopify you can create a product \\'variant\\' for this type of thing, like size or color, but instead of \\'size\\', you\\'d make it \\'quantity in sq. feet\\' and then add a bunch of variant options like \\'1 sq foot\\', \\'2 sq feet\\', \\'3 sq feet\\', etc. and control the price for each of the options. there\\'s a guide on it here too: https://docs.shopify.com/manual/your-store/products/variants, Sounds like Ruby would be overkill/not the best tool for the job. Shopify and Big Commerce would be much easier to implement an e commerce solution for. You could set up a basic site with zero coding knowledge in minutes, and then tweak it with basic css/html. Or hire someone off odesk for $5 an hour to take care of the fiddly bits.\\n\\nIf you\\'re just passionate about learning and are using this as a learn-by-doing exercise, check out Codecademy and Learn Ruby on Rails by Daniel Kehoe (I\\'m doing Michael Hartl\\'s book, but this sounds better suited to you). You can probably get really something basic up in a month or two and then keep adding features to it forever.\\n\\nBut again, using Ruby for an e-commerce site sounds like using a pneumatic drill to get a nail into a plank of wood..., You should try out with Smoolis. It has a theme that is designed especially for \"One Product\" concept.\\n\\nAs i have tried many other platforms, i find most of them hard to use.\\nI tried Shopify and my personal opinion, is that it\\'s a good platform, but too expensive with so many plugins and themes that you have to pay additionally. You can find some providers who’d be able to design you a decent-looking store for less.\\n\\nSo far, i use Smoolis and i\\'m totally satisfied with this service. I find it as the most affordable solution for a small-medium business. It\\'s the only one with no fees at all, all of their themes are free and responsive, and you can have in minutes your store multilingual without any complicated programming. \\n\\nI hope this suggestion helps and i also hope that it matches all of your requirements. ;), Just bought one.\\n\\nUsed MATTEY20 brought it down to 9 bucks us.

And something that is busy and outdated will look unprofessional, because it is distracting and just makes you look out of touch. The bag looks fine in black and burgundy, but the other colours are too casual. Especially the light tiffany blue seems to have trouble with a clashing-ish yellow trim that makes all the buckles stand out even more.   \\n\\nETA: [Here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/15/ea/2a/15ea2a71287643c914779f6243499ff0.jpg) is a tote in a similar colour to yours, that I think look more professional because of its simple design. It\\'s still not the most on-trend colour, but the modern shape helps a lot.\\n\\n\\n\\nNormally, blue is fine. For example [this blue tote](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0260/1439/products/tote_blue_1024x1024.jpg?v=1426093152)(the popular Dagne Dover) is a royal blue and still looks professional. I would argue that this [pink tote](http://www.kate-spadeoutletonline.com/images/Kate-Spade/Kate%20Spade%20New%20York%20Cedar%20Street%20Small%20Harmony%20Tote%20Bag%20Lightpink_02.jpg) would also be fine.

I understand what you mean. I\\'d love to have a custom made website soon, but as for now I think it\\'s in my finances best interest if I use the Shopify themes available to me since website designs can be so expensive.\\n2. Thanks! I really feel that webpages where the product being sold covers up the majority of the page are efficient at generating sales. Also, since I have 80+ types of yarn I want people to see as many different patterns as they can at one time. \\n3. I had the coupon set at 5 seconds, but have pushed it back to 20. See the reason why it\\'s so difficult to choose the timing is because some people, such as /u/__dolphin was saying, don\\'t like the pop-up coming too soon and will actually exit out. I do have the option of making it so that the pop-up happens when people move their mouse over their back button to try to ask them as they are leaving, but I feel like that would be less effective. Is there a rule of thumb for when your pop-up should happen?\\n4. Yeah apps are great. I use Shippo to aggregate a bunch of shipping rates for me (they also have discounted USPS Priority Mail Shipping rates, and since that\\'s what I use for maybe 75% of my orders that makes a huge difference), apps that make the coupon pop-up box, as well as multiple other ones.\\n\\nThanks for helping me out, I really appreciate it!

I\\'m not only getting the big 135yd rolls you see here, there\\'s going to be 65yd rolls as well, along with a new type of yarn altogether! It\\'s made from a similar material to high quality shoelaces, like what you\\'d find on a pair of converse. \\n\\nAs for design ideas you mentioned, I have actually thought about some of those things before but didn\\'t know how to implement them. Now I\\'ll have a Shopify guru help me get this stuff done. \\n\\nIt seems that the biggest suggestion is change the pop-up.

Maybe instead of a pop up, use a banner (comes with most shopify themes) and maybe make an advertised banner of 10% off with code with a clean background a few of your most popular designs to the side leaning against each other or just Photoshop them in! Could also use it for other sites to advertise. \\n\\nI was thinking after I posted is maybe a section where people can then submit their finished products, grab onto those buyers for as long as you can, not only will you have people coming back but more people will say to others to check their finished piece on your site.

This is all constructive and in no way is it meant to be anything other than that.\\nFirst Thought: too much open space on your homepage. Your logo should be bigger. Move everything up, so you don\\'t have to scroll to see entire page.\\nThe Welcome description: \"Welcome to the ONLY knitting- not last.\\nJust sounds better don\\'t you think?\\nwithin that welcome description you mention all the cool ideas for the yarn, make those clickable links so people can see what it is that they can accomplish(hint: use your pinterest page)!\\nI think you should use the yarn more as a pointer in your website. Kind of like a follow the yellow brick road thing. The yarn weaves to links and stories and etc..\\nConsider using a video to show the quality of the yarn, also on the about us page! Quick video of both of you just talking about your passion. People love to put a face to a brand!\\nMaybe add some more colorful spools of yarn around the site to make it more graphically appealing. \\nCTA bar at the bottom, link it again to a video explaining what you are selling, then link it to an opt in sign up for newsletter.\\nIs that CTA Bar from jvzoo? \\nOh by the way, no popup after 20 seconds??\\nDon\\'t listen to people complaining of popup\\'s, they flat out work. There is all kinds of data that proves they do!\\nYou are selling something that is creative in nature and visual! Make your site more interactive!\\nWhy don\\'t you have a real company email?\\nVisitor\\'s identify that it is a real company when it is a corporate email address.\\nIf you don\\'t want to use the 20 second pop. There is a software I use that is heatmap controlled and can be set on the scroll, timed or upon an action to exit! Works really well. A \"before you go\" message!\\nShopify is fine, there is a great shopify store builder app that I have, has some super stuff in it!\\nThe site is fine, it is just not optimized in my opinion.\\nYou could really benefit from video, visuals, the yarn theme!!! and a few more tweaks.\\nI hope this will help you get the most out of what you are trying to do!\\nGood Luck., This is not going to be popular but my suggestion off the top of my head is:\\n\\n\\nSell a product, t shirt store\\n\\n\\nLook, I know it\\'s lame but like you said \\n\\n\\n&gt; I am not looking for some miracle that will get me rich with no money out of my pocket up front, just looking for a small project to keep me busy over the summer\\n\\n\\n-T-shirt require almost no start-up capital as you\\'re doing drop-ship\\n\\n\\n-Require very little tech-savviness, anybody can get by with youtube/online tutorials using FREE existing platform such as woocommerce or other open-source cms.

I\\'ll take some time to reply to you in detail.\\n\\n* My logo was actually bigger yesterday, but then someone told me to make it smaller because it took up too much space! This is one of those things that is definitely hard to figure out... Maybe I can make it a little bigger to find a happy medium, or reduce the spacing above and below it to make it bigger without pushing everything else away.\\n\\n* As for moving everything up, I actually had the products all the way at the top and the welcome section at the bottom, but I was told to move the welcome up so it \"greets people as they walk into the store\" instead of having it at the bottom as a sort of afterthought. What do you suggest I do?\\n* I have changed it from \"last\" knitting store to \"only\", good catch.\\n* You\\'re definitely right about having links in the welcome paragraph, I\\'ll fix this today. I also have the option to put a slideshow on the front page which would show up below the welcome section but above the product. I can always adjust the placement... but I feel that if I have the logo up top, navigation bar, welcome section, AND  a slideshow it pushes the product all the way to the bottom. Is that wrong, or will people instinctively scroll down?\\n* As for using the yarn as a pointer, what does that mean? Sorry, googling website pointer only showed results pertaining to multiple domain names.\\n* I have definitely been planning on getting a short 1 minute introduction video to t-shirt yarn, then I\\'d just need to figure out where to put it.\\n* As for putting a face to the brand, I\\'ll be adding pics of my and my partner to the \"about us\" page soon. \\n* I have removed the popup (which I thought actually looked really pretty, since I spent a few hours working on it..) because I\\'ve had multiple people tell me pop-ups are a no-no. It\\'s fine, though. I switch to a service that has more features and is actually less expensive; Optinmonster. Now I have the bar that pops up at the bottom of the page, which I\\'m hoping is less intrusive, even if it isn\\'t as pretty.\\n* I have wanted a corporate email address. I\\'ve actually tried finding out how to get one but I think I forgot to follow up on it... on the to-do list it goes.\\n* Which software and shopify apps do you have?

I am OK at coding; on LemonStand I am able to do a lot of the customization myself., Too lazy to photograph \\'em all and upload so ill just pull them from good old google image.\\n\\n(In chronological order)\\n\\n\\n* [Awolnation](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/1b/93/23/1b9323efea4e859e46b68e04302c9bd1.jpg)\\n\\n* [Streetlight Manifesto](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0102/4382/products/478_large.jpg?v=1353109137): One of my favorite merch purchases. \\n\\n\\n* [A$AP Worldwide tie dye from A$AP Rocky\\'s Made In America set](http://media.myplaydirect.com/dda/28897768/27427b712423f53afcacd6637f9ed294.jpg)\\n\\n* [Vampire Weekend MVOTC tour t-shirt](http://40.media.tumblr.com/13b866b58568672a07c69b7a5dca8f24/tumblr_mm2npbq0lS1r3zexno4_540.jpg)\\n\\n* [Franz Ferdinand](http://www.punkandpissed.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/F/r/Franz-Ferdinand-Reverse-slim-fit-black-t-shirt-f_4.jpg)\\n\\n\\n* [RL Grime sadboys longsleeve (in the middle, top is front, back is bottom image)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bem6MhpCcAELycG.png)\\n\\n* [Feed Me\\'s Psychedelic Journey tour t](http://dxkdul4cprxwx.cloudfront.net/438e71349ce348f2ac570b5dbee03b81_820x820.jpg)\\n\\n* [Kanye West Yeezus tour t from Made In America 2014 front](http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/vYkAAOSwPhdVPAEJ/$_35.JPG) and [back](https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xap1/t51.2885-15/s306x306/e15/10520412_301131803417657_563509386_n.jpg)\\n\\n* [The Black Keys Turn Blue t front](http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/4~wAAOSwBLlVTCN9/$_35.JPG)\\n\\n* [Skinny Kids skull t-shirt (bought online, didn\\'t see them)](https://www.facebook.com/skinnykidsband/photos/a.496236203757323.1073741829.492642687450008/696743337039941/?type=1&amp;theater)\\n\\n* [Fool\\'s Gold Tie Dye t](http://store.foolsgoldrecs.com/products/copy-of-fools-gold-logo-tee-headband#.VX7pGWRViko)\\n\\nNaturally none of these are indie, but that\\'s all I\\'ve got.  , I\\'m 19, don\\'t have a degree, I know html/css/php/learning javascript. I\\'m familiar with business concepts and I know WordPress, Shopify, and Joomla very well.\\n\\nI also have no money to get to austin\\n\\nAlso I am a US citizen., Turbolinks 5 will do this, but they don\\'t recommend using it in production yet. You can use [Tubrograft](https://github.com/Shopify/turbograft)., I did see that....I might have to do the trial and see how it works. It seems that your company is doing some really cool stuff in conjunction with Shopify., Their is not standard quality of a theme. Some designers/developers do an amazing job and provide ample documentation that allow you to  dig in and extend the theme to your specific needs ......Others don\\'t, and sell half assed spaghetti code that is head scratchinly confusing. Most of the better themes have accessible developers, documentation, community, and references, click through those and ask questions.\\n\\nFor the most part, Shopify themes are inherently easy to manipulate, and setting them up outside of your production environment is easy to do. So hack away and see what you can figure out.\\n\\nTo your Point 2 - you can simply delete the hero feature/scroller feature from any page. Problem solved?, I\\'m not personally familiar with PayPoint, as it looks like they\\'re UK only and my company works with US-based processors. \\n\\nI took a quick look through their website and didn\\'t see any pricing disclosed, which is usually a red flag for finding competitive and transparent processors in the US, but I don\\'t know enough about British processing to say if that\\'s customary.\\n\\nIf you\\'re happy with the service and confident you\\'re being billed fairly and as agreed, then why would it matter if other people like Shopify better?, You\\'re asking the wrong questions, I\\'m launching a site in shopify soon, and here\\'s my take:\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\n- fast\\n- clean templates\\n- fairly easy to use\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\n- no control\\n- can\\'t customize checkout page at all (no liquid template file)\\n- real-time shipping costs an extra $20/month, but they may waive it\\n- adding any custom fields to pages is a huge pain in the butt.  It actually requires using two 3rd party chrome extensions. Scary.\\n- No virtual terminal for managing phone payments or custom orders with prices or shipping.  An iPhone POS app exists, but none for web or android\\n- No email servers.  You\\'ll have to forward to a personal account, or setup Google Apps for Work or similar.  (if you want to be able to reply from name@yourdomain.com)\\n\\nWooCommerce seems decent, but honestly the thought of running any kind of ecommerce on a WP base install terrifies me.  That CMS is constantly under attack.  It would make me really nervous if I had to maintain it myself as someone with only OK tech/programming abilities.  If you want a self-hosted solution I\\'d look into either Spree commerce (new, solid code, but has crap for templates), or PrestaShop which seems OK but is a bit buggy and has some performance issues., This sounds familiar. I do love me my Shopify, but have been provided with the \"Check the app store/pay a dev/figure it out\" response all to often. LemonStand has an entirely different approach., Actually custom fields is super easy. PM me and I can help you. It\\'s built right into the shopify scripting language. \\n\\nEdit: you can do minor customization on c/o page too as long as it\\'s just text you want to add. , Best way is to purchase protector cases\\n[link](http://high-class-retro.myshopify.com/) and then put bubble wrap around each one of them. Then put stiff cardboard around the 10 Amiibo set. Put this inside a Home Depot Heavy Duty moving box. Then put packing popcorn (real popcorn from $1 store if you want to be cheap don\\'t open the bags) around the cardboarded Amiibo inside the Home Depot box. It is a little overkill but it\\'ll be very protected., You mention Themeforest, part of what they provide as a marketplace is access and community - ask away. [For example](http://themeforest.net/item/ap-gentshop-shopify-responisive-theme/11406085/comments) this theme has a lot of Q/A, and is well resourced (so it seems)., Loading takes FOREVER, speed it up or you\\'ll just be trashed by Hello bar, To be fair, it depends on your business model for some of those plugins. As well as these are flat rates, not subscription based like shopify\\'s. , My league has a [championship belt](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0168/1436/products/fantasy-football-champion-belt1_large.jpg?v=1431125954), which is separate from our standard league trophy, and is arguably more prestigious to win.\\n\\nWhoever is the top-scoring team in Week1 starts off with the belt (this would definitely be a lot more difficult if everyone in your league lives in different cities), and the second-highest scoring team is the #1 contender. In Week2, those two teams \\'face off\\' (not in a head-to-head fantasy matchup; just as a side-game for the belt), and the highest score between them in Week2 gets the belt for the next week.\\n\\nThe top score among the other 8 teams is the #1 contender in Week3, and so on. Doing well in Week15 (the last chance to be the #1 contender) and especially Week16 (final week of the playoffs) is huge, since the winner holds onto the belt for the next ~8.5 months.\\n\\nIt\\'s a little tacky, but for a group of 30-something-year-old guys who grew up idolizing WWF superstars, this has made everyone in my league put in a lot of extra effort. The belt costs about $120, so a $10/person investment (which should last multiple years) is worth every penny.\\n\\n(I know this doesn\\'t exactly answer your question about payouts, but it has proven to be a far more effective method of keeping everyone interested than any cash payout would provide), That\\'s posted at the top of this page: http://advanced-vapors.myshopify.com/collections/rba-rda where I was considering buying an authentic Aeolus, [found these on a phat deal for £55 do i cop](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0491/9773/files/b-gift-guide-3-aw14-03.jpg)\\n\\nwould prefer the lows, but these are £40 cheaper than the lows everywhere else and i\\'m tempted, It probably wouldn\\'t mean much to someone who hadn\\'t been here, but since you said he collects lesser-known ones... How about the East Van cross such as [this](http://www.thrillershop.com/store/images/products/68/0_l.jpg) or [this](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0205/4348/products/East_van_Cross_guys_t.jpg)?, Well that is unfortunate. We are switching POS/eCommerce providers, and will be international sometime next month. Its a PITA to do international through Shopify., Get rid of the big carousel on the front page. It uses tons of space and doesn\\'t really say \"buy me\", \\'\\'Mars chocolate bar is fantastic, and so is this planet\\'\\'....then I procede to take out a [Mars bar](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0269/2121/products/Mars_Bar.jpg?v=1383078655) and throw it into the air., Try Better Recommendations. https://apps.shopify.com/better-recommendations, Hi,\\nI am happy you are going to adopt some of my suggestions. I love the slider idea! The problem is people hate to scroll! Let me think about how you can solve that.\\nThe using yarn as a pointer is a little vague, when I put it down.\\nWhat I meant was use yarn threads and spools in the background of your pages and you know how people \"follow a thread?\", I was referring to using the yarn as the thread to things you want people to focus on!\\nPop ups work, don\\'t take people\\'s advice! Overwhelming data proves these people wrong! Use it!!\\nA corporate email address should have come as part of your hosting package, or at least an option. Contact your hosting company and get 1 setup. Make sure you use 1 address like, info@xxxxx.com.\\nThe intro video should be front and center on your first page! You should also be using that video to redirect people to an opt in form.\\nMake up, or I could help you, a lead magnet! Just a short 2 page report on what the benefits of using your product is, or a how to pdf. Something of value to give away in turn to capture their email! I will get you the shopify link asap. There is actually a killer new program, that was released maybe 4 or 5 days ago. I will give you the link when I can find it! You know, people give their opinions, like the logo being too small or too big. I personally think it\\'s too small, because it is a neat logo. There are programs that pop the logo when you get onto your site, it is animated, anfd then it goes away. This is proven to engage people also. I am a huge believer in animation, video, visuals etc.. the more the better.\\nThe days of static websites are over! The more interactive your site is, the more successful you will be.\\nIf there is anythnig else I can help you with, don\\'t hesitate to ask! I am here to help., It\\'s going to be pretty hard to come up with a completely unique app idea. All of the low hanging fruit has been picked over. I would suggest finding an app that you can improve on an build that. Obviously you don\\'t want to straight up rip off an existing app, but if you can take this same idea and add value to it then all is fair. , The site is nothing pretty!  It is kinda held together with scotch tape due to budget constraints; and I ended up scrapping the custom feature that brought me to LemonStand.  I\\'m working with a developer on a fresh look now.  Visit {my user name}.com\\n\\nThe custom feature in question was real-time price updating on the product page, in response to a change in quantity or variant option, WITH tiered pricing.  In other words, qty 1 is $40, qty 2 is $80, qty 3 is $110 ($10 savings).  A typical webstore shows tiered price savings in the cart only (e.g. Shopify).  I wanted the price savings to appear in real-time on the product page.  I scrapped it because it (a) was slow, (b) was too complex to maintain the product library, (c) seemed like more trouble than it was worth in general.

I work in support so I end up installing these extensions for clients daily. IMO Shopify\\'s UI is 100% better than Woo, it\\'s just cleaner and much easier to use. I like Shopify\\'s customer support team much better than Woo\\'s. \\n\\nIf you\\'re not sold on Shopify then I would recommend checking out Bigcommerce also. But honestly I wouldn\\'t make this decision purely off of the price. €59/month is a relatively small fee when you\\'re weighing your online livelihood. \\n\\nI may be biased though. I\\'ve managed personal Shopify sites, but I don\\'t have any experience with Woo outside of my day job., I may not be looking for a connection here but rather a piece of advice:\\n\\nI run a Shopify store right now that I\\'m getting off the ground.

Integrations and accompany services can really compliment the system and if you know your stuff you can build put some beautiful things.\\n\\nIt may be a more substantial investment, but if you think spending a couple of hundred dollars a month to run a proper business is expensive, your not doing it right. \\n\\nThere\\'s always exceptions to that rule, but it\\'s worth looking into Shopify Plus and accompanying services to get pretty much everything on your list taken care of.\\n\\nI could go on, but I won\\'t., [bahhh](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0370/6817/products/30_Sheep_Thankyou_large.jpg?v=1393952681), http://theodent.myshopify.com/products/theodent-300-whitening-crystal-mint, I found a 1590g \"tall boy\" and a dual 18650 sled for a 1590a.

I have a hard time understanding where the most of that time would go if you\\'re not including content generation.\\n\\nEDIT: Should clarify what kind of project this is. As /u/tripperjack states below, a app that requires coding would be a lot different from, say, a Shopify store., &gt; Would you like a team called the \"Micks?\" With a red-nosed redheaded drunk being their mascot?\\n\\nYou\\'ve seen the Notre Dame cartoon mascot, right?  Contrast that with the Redskins, I think the former would be considered far more offensive, if anyone really cared.\\n\\n&gt; And then meanwhile they will sing catholic prayers at the games and then laugh about how stupid all that Catholic shit is.\\n\\nReally?  See I don\\'t see it that way.  There\\'s hundreds of different names for mascots, antrhopomorphic mascots are almost always reserved for warlike cultures, or those who are famous for their military skill or prowess:  Spartans, Trojans, Knights, Norsemen, Seminoles, Cowboys, Knights, Crusaders, the list is huge.  Nobody names their team after an object of scorn.  If anything it provides a level of pride.  There are Norsemen fans that wear those stupid hat / fake mustasche and beard combo.  I don\\'t consider that offensive, especially because they\\'re showing pride in their team, they\\'re into rooting for their team, not trying to make a stereotypical statement of scorn for Norsemen.  If you see it that way, I propose your perception of the situation is faulty.  Who cares that a headdress was not used by native Americans the way they\\'re used by Redskin fans.  Florida State does the tomahawk chop, and that has nothing to do with Seminoles neither does the warchant.  FSU fans aren\\'t expressing scorn for Seminoles when they do that, they\\'re expressing school pride and cheering for their team.\\n\\nI think people get way too fired up over it.\\n\\nEdit:  To include [this chart](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0211/4926/files/PopChartLab_ChartofCollegeSportsTeams_Zoom_407.jpg) of NCAA mascot names., Shopify and WooCommerce come to mind., Shopify\\'s probably the easiest from what I\\'ve heard. , Both great platforms. \\n\\nShopify is going to get you up and running faster, but carries a monthly fee.\\n\\nWordpress + WooCommerce will cost more up front (hosting, themes), needs someone with a bit of web knowledge to get you going, but lower cost over the longer term., &gt; Yotpo \\n\\nWhat does it do? Couldn\\'t figure out exactly from the website., I agree with the first comment. Use a hosted solution like Shopify or Bigcommerce to get a good looking site, and get a designer on elance or odesk to make you a nice logo. Your splash image could be better, too - don\\'t make it so obvious that it\\'s your garage or kitchen table. Instead, just use the computer and give it a different background. You can also highlight your competitor prices on the individual product pages themselves, and those should be proper images, not gears and wheels. Good luck!, You should get better quality pictures. Even if you use stock photos it will be better than what you have. You can\\'t expect people to pay $1,000+ when your site looks like it was made by a middle schooler in 2000. You should do a wordpress or a shopify site. While shopify may seem more expensive their tools are valuable for setting up a professional looking shop quickly.

It\\'s ingenius because the customer can write the review within their email client - they don\\'t need to be taken to a new website. They just respond the the email.\\n\\nWHY IS NOBODY ELSE DOING THIS?!?!\\n\\nThey also host product ratings on your website, which is sort of cool, but it has their branding all over it. Additionally, they are partnered with Google to collect store reviews so you get star ratings in your PPC and Shopping ads., Their review collection tool is all I care about personally., I use the free tier. Yotpo\\'s poor customer support, UX, and ridiculous pricing keeps me from signing up.\\n\\nReview apps are such a scam. I use Yotpo to send an email to the customer asking for a review, and they can just respond to the email without being directed to a new website. It\\'s fabulous. Then, I take it and import it into the Shopify Reviews app., I\\'ve used wordpress and I find it to be dreadful.  I\\'ll try shopify as that name keeps coming up.\\n\\nI knew my site didn\\'t look good, but middle school level might be pushing it :), That first sentence: \"after purchase, they send an email to the customer asking for a product review.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s the piece of information I was looking for. I can build this prototype very quickly. How would you like to beta test it for me? If/when I release this to the app store, I\\'d be happy to offer it to you free of charge for life. Want to get in touch over email?, 1) Yes, the order comments/note section is on the cart page. Unfortunately shopify doesn\\'t also have it on the checkout page making it a bit confusing. I\\'ve tried to find a solution to also add the order note box on the checkout page but there\\'s nothing currently. We\\'re looking at moving away from shopify within the next few months for a more open &amp; customizable framework. \\n\\n2) The juices aren\\'t pre-steeped, but instead fast-steeped when they\\'re mixed. So the juice doesn\\'t sit in on a shelf for a week before shipping out, everything is shipped out the same day that it\\'s mixed, only that it goes through our 4-5 hour fast-steeping process before being boxed up and shipped. The best way to get an order sooner would be to contact us via email and let us know that you would like your order right away. \\n\\n3) Our first priority will always be providing a top quality product and service at an affordable price to every customer we can. Making a profit is not nearly as important to me. I feel that far too many businesses focus on the bottom line rather than improving their product and service. , http://ctrlpaint.myshopify.com/products/digital-painting-starter-kit &lt;--- Purchase\\n, \"Good\" is relative to what you want.\\n\\nShopify is an excellent choice in my opinion.  I\\'ve been with them for 3 yrs now and while far from perfect, they are pretty damned good for the price., Sorry for being crass. But you should focus on what you do best. Building high quality niche computers. Leave the work to shopify. , Quite honestly, you can see that website building is not my strong suit.  I agree with this and if shopify allows me to make the best looking website quickly, then I\\'m all for it., This is funny since I was thinking about the same EXACT thing yesterday. TripAdvisor sent me an email with a link to rate the hotel. I thought, it\\'d take a few hours to program it to simply let me reply to it to leave a review.\\n\\nSeems like a good app for shopify.\\n\\nAnd thanks for explaining it!, Welcome to the internet, you can\\'t change assholes over VoIP    \\n\\nhttp://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0042/9942/products/dickwad2_det_1024x1024.jpg?v=1305060896, Affixing the lid is [optional](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0188/6794/products/RPI_Foundartion_case_3_of_4_1024x1024.JPG?v=1433330863) if you want access to GPIO or plan to use a HAT., The Google Shopping app on Shopify worked great to get listed there.

There are tons of sellers on eBay selling similar kind of stuff for MUCH MUCH lower from China.\\n\\nGo to Shopify., I\\'ve built a much better website since my original post using shopify.  Let me know what you think now: http://twobrotherspcs.com/, I agree with most of what you said.  But I am very specific with filtering my customers before they click on my ads (I list my prices right in the ads).  Therefore, I expect the average customer to know a minimal level of \"tech\", know before coming to my site what they will be spending approximately, and also be able to compare to competitors to see that what I offer is indeed just as good or better.  Prices are my best selling point.  This is why I link to competitors.  I am trying to build a customer base of people who go to my competitors and balk at the outrageous prices.  My ads target these types of people.\\n\\n\\nBtw I created a better site with shopify.  Let me know how it looks now: http://twobrotherspcs.com/, It\\'s from Fallout.  [This is the picture](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0260/0169/products/War_Never_Changes_large.jpg?v=1415398955), This is a t-shirt shop (read: a guy at home who designed a shirt with a photo on it) that will 100% outsource every print. So email him, tell him the issues, and then get him (read: his t-shirt place) to print you another one. \\n\\nDTG printing is not great - the issue is more with the format of DTG printing (i.e. you can\\'t get a high resolution print that easily on a tshirt fabric, in the same way that you can\\'t get a fantastic print on a canvas easily when you\\'re really inspecting it). These things are meant to be viewed from far away, not up close. \\n\\nThey likely could have done a better job by showing actual models wearing it, but again, these stores take like 40 minutes to make the whole thing (shopify template, t-shirt plugin, facebook ad). \\n\\n, Hello! First of all, you have a lovely home. I like the architectural details in it. Very charming.\\n\\nNow, my opinion on the layout. To be honest, I feel like the [old layout](http://i.imgur.com/RbtYQzrh.jpg) is way better than the new one. For one, as u/jatoospry mentioned, the traffic flow to the sofa in the new arrangement isn\\'t the most convenient. Two, for me, the old layout seems to be more visually balanced because the radiator and the sofa (two massive horizontal elements) are across each other. \\n\\nOf course, take this with a grain of salt, but if I were to choose the layout, I\\'d stick with the original. I suggest replacing the tv cart with a more low-height \"solid\" piece. Maybe a low cabinet or credenza like [this](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0062/5492/products/CHADHAUS_FARMHOUSE_CREDENZA_01_1024x1024.jpg?v=1423863884)? \\n\\nThe RH wall lamp you showed us before is a great option! Either one of the two options of finish will suit your living room.\\nMounting height, if I\\'m not mistaken, as rule of thumb, is the same as the height of floor lamps. So that would be around 1.5 meters to 1.8 meters from the floor.\\n, What area of security is he interested in?\\n\\n * I\\'ve given a friend a copy of the original Diffie Hellman paper (He is a crypto guy.)\\n\\n * As others have mentioned, anything from Hak5\\'s shop https://hakshop.myshopify.com/\\n\\n * Or https://greatscottgadgets.com would be cool too\\n\\n * MassDrop.com has Southord lock picks on sale all the time., It\\'s definitely possible, but you may have to get into the template code. Hard to give more specifics without at least knowing what theme you\\'re using., The theme is liquid. , No, Squarespace uses a separate payment processor called Stripe. Squarespace is a WYSIWYG website builder; Shopify is specifically built for web commerce, as is Square (which is a separate customer from Squarespace; confusing, I know)., Try freelancer.com - I hire people from there to do my eBay and Amazon listings all of the time and most of the people I end up hiring have shopify experience as well., You don\\'t.

Talk to as many people as possible, ask questions, gather data. Create a newsletter sign up and hype that up. Run mini experiments like landing page test\\'s. \\n\\nIf the idea seems to be viable, begin getting serious about it. Write up a business plans/lean canvas. Begin wireframing and create prototypes. Sometimes you don\\'t need to learn to code to get an MVP completed – maybe you could use something like Shopify or Squarespace?\\n\\nIf you\\'ve gotten this far and you\\'re still interested, and the data/feedback is still pointing in the right direction – try and get your hands on money from anywhere. Government grants, competitions, your parents/friends, anything. A few $K should be able to get you a pretty scrappy MVP together, and let you gain some early traction/onboard your first users.\\n\\nThis should be enough to grab the attention of angel investors/accelerators/incubators etc.\\n\\n, There\\'s literally a page in the shopify dashboard where you paste the code. , Have you already set up a payment processor such as stripe or paypal that will be integrated with your shopify site?  \\n\\nIn order to set up a stripe account, you need to provide stripe with bank account info.\\n\\nIf you only have a personal banking account, you may want to look at creating a new business banking account.  , Have to agree with smegnose. If you are really a beginner, you will likely be in over your head. There are a ton of responsive themes for shopify - I\\'d suggest starting there. , There are indeed lots of options on the store, and most of them are well rated and offer the features you\\'re looking for.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like something entirely free and have some tech skills, you could easily create your own by following this liquid code hack from [Shopify Docs](http://docs.shopify.com/support/your-store/products/can-i-recommend-related-products).\\n\\nI don\\'t recommend going with a free app as they tend to have poor (if any) customer support and disappear very quickly from the store, sometimes without a notice. And the ones that stay are usually not as free as they say, or make use of your customers personal data for their own purposes.\\n\\nIf you are willing to pay for a professional grade solution and spare you headaches trying to maintain a DIY solution, I recommend [Recomatic Related Products](https://apps.shopify.com/recomatic) that I personally co-founded.\\n\\nIf you shop gets traffic, you\\'ll see it\\'s worth the money in no time, it has all the features you asked for, it\\'s well rated and it\\'s been around for a long time. It\\'s not the cheapest option available, but like you\\'ll see in the comments we try to provide the best customer support possible, do all the customizing and styling for you free of charge and are trusted by some of the biggest stores on Shopify.\\n, I have not fired the gun in its current form, but I did fire it basically how it is now, only I added a stock to it and a front sight so I could aim it easier. You can see it [demonstrated here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dVkTh8czus), there really isnt much recoil to it at all. \\n\\nActually, after i filmed my friend doing this, I removed the stock which made it look like as it appears now in the photos and fired the gun one handed.. the gun literally does not move... There is absolutely NO RECOIL at all and the major reason why is because of the [muzzle brake](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0157/8968/products/Saker_556_brake_bdd757c9-1184-4cdd-a9cb-dd4a8d8f64d8_1024x1024.png?v=1421108332) at the end of the barrel. Do you notice how the brake has 3 vented ports on the side? because of those vents, it actually sends the recoil, concussion, and sound out towards the *sides* of the weapon and not straight back. \\n\\nI really did think the gun was going to have significantly worse recoil then my AR15 carbine, but this is just like shooting a bb gun! :D, Skirtle is one of the best sites for online shopping with social networking. Check out your most loved items from popular stores at one place, save them and share them with your skirtle friends instantly., Shopify is a great starting platform but there is a monthly fee and they take a percentage of your sales. However, they do handle all payments meaning you don\\'t have to purchase an SSL certificate \\nWoo commerce is very similar with the added  benefits of being free and they don\\'t take a cut of sales though you will have to buy an SSL certificate as well as a more involved setup., I wrapped up that project about five months ago. \\n\\nThank you for the thorough reply - might help out someone else searching for the same thing.\\n\\nOriginally we tried running Linkcious.  Total shitshow.  On the day of launch, there were something like 40k unique visitors... and Linkcious freaked out, removed the related products, and replaced them with massive, bright red warnings about exceeding allotted data - an absolutely abhorrent way of handling overages.  No one at Linkcious could be reached within the first 24 hours, and the higher-ups on this project were seeing red (figuratively and literally).\\n\\nOvernight, I whipped up something using the liquid code you linked to, and mixed in some overrides using Metafields2 (which was already running for different purposes).  The entire theme was made from scratch, with a very specific style guide that needed to be adhered to, so I think custom was the only valid solution anyways.\\n\\nWill keep Recomatic in mind for future projects, though.  Looks interesting - and the flat fee is more appealing than a sliding scale structure., No I haven\\'t but I am working on getting a business account. Is stripe the go to processor? I guess I was under the impression that shopify handled this because I saw things regarding credit card fees., &gt; You earn through referral by sending shopify customers/clients to build their business on their platform. Is this through links? If not then what way?\\n\\nYes, you receive a Shopify Affiliate link. Every time somebody register using your link, you will earn 20% of their invoices\\n\\n\\n&gt;Also, is this different from the partner program or just the same? Does this partner program applies to freelancers and agencies or through businesses as well.\\n\\nIn the partner program, you can submit themes and apps and make them available on the Shopify app store.\\n\\n\\n&gt;And what does the 20% monthly revenue share means?\\n\\nYou will receive 20% of the invoice value (of their monthly Shopify plans), Hobo wine is actually a wine company...\\n\\nhttp://hobowines.myshopify.com/, Shopify support is helpful. Also, considering hiring someone from fiverr.com. It\\'s $5 a gig. , http://the-pistol-shrimps.myshopify.com/\\n\\nSpoken on., Oh. Its that. Thank you. \\nBut what if you\\'re an agency or a freelancer, do you send them the link or do you use your own link and set them up for them. \\nBecause, I was trying to figure out how the agencies/freelancers do it.  , As a partner, you have the opportunity to do the all set up for them. You can then \"transfer\" the store to whoever the client is\\nhttps://docs.shopify.com/partners/faq#dev-shop, This is what I was going for : http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0181/2235/t/36/assets/slideshow_4.jpg?9874840984987509240\\n\\nobviously not every piece but the jacket and sweater, Cool. Thanks for the patience on answering my questions. , Hey there, a few inputs from me as i am bored anyway:\\n\\n* 1000 is not much, dont expect to much from that.\\n* A part of these 1000 are most likely bots, spam and therelike. Do you use Analytics? It will list if you GA code is also used by other hosts. (I have a website with about 2500 monthly views, where about 2300 are spam over the GA code, dunno why so much on that specific site)\\n* Both websites look amateurish (sorry). The new one clearly is more modern but the dark background just kicks it. You also need a favicon. I like the new domain, logo and beards tho :).\\n* More on the new website: Centering text is a bit outdated, italic in this case as well\\n* I think shopify offers bitcoin, use that and advertise with it. As soon as your design is fixed up, advertise on cryptocoin subreddits.\\n* And the most important thing: **Why the fuck do i have to buy a windows license?**. I am not sure about this specific sector, but professional PC builds i know of usually let you buy it without properitary shit licenses., I don\\'t think this kind of fundamental advice is something people need to pay for; in short, liquid files ARE the HTML/CSS. \\n\\nHere is a good three-part overview tutorial on shopify: http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/learn-how-to-build-themes-for-shopify--cms-534\\n\\nIf you know enough basic web dev and have worked with cms\\'s before, shopify isn\\'t too hard. , Your choice but I\\'m comfortable with Woocommerce, Shopify, Prestashop, Magento, and OpenCart., not a problem.\\nHave a good day, [DasKeyboard states the

^2 ^more_, Exactly... Shopify powers 100s of thousands of e-commerce websites, all using Rails. They heavily cache their page content to get quick page loads., Cool. The Genesis looks like a great, no-nonsense blade. I\\'ve heard a lot of good things about LT Wright knives. Want to try one.   \\nBTW, here is a good knife shop with a decent selection, if you are not familiar with them: http://5-starr-knives-cutlery.myshopify.com/collections/all/l-t-wright-handcrafted-knives, We\\'ll be keeping it free for that product forever. We do have premium functionality, managed service etc that requires upgrading but that is the free product, Yes. This is a good place to start: http://www.shopifyandyou.com/pages/google-analytics-setup, They sell the paper and other things on their website: http://sfchronicle.myshopify.com/collections/golden-state-warriors-2015-season\\n\\nIt\\'s a little more pricey since it\\'s only $1.50 in the stands, but that\\'s probably the best way to get it., you can SF chronicle them online, its about 4 bucks for the paper and 10 or so for the delivery. Link here, I don\\'t know about the quality of the delivery however. http://sfchronicle.myshopify.com/, I\\'ve fallen in love with [shopify](http://www.shopify.ca/) recently. I didn\\'t have to worry about security, they host everything and it quite easy to get started on. The only downside is that the client will have a monthly subscription to pay, but they should be paying you that much anyways to host. And if your site does well you get paid over time from shopify (because you brought them the customer)., You need to send some of those to Amy at [Amy\\'s Bakery Company](http://amys-baking-company.myshopify.com/), use shopify at least instead of volusion :), http://sfchronicle.myshopify.com/collections/2015-nba-finals?page=1, http://sfchronicle.myshopify.com/collections/2015-nba-finals?page=1, No Amy\\'s Baking Company \\n\\nhttp://amys-baking-company.myshopify.com/, Hi, op! \\nYou weren\\'t supposed to read!

I know Taylor Stitch, but they are way out of the way for me. Or have any recommendations on places to check out in NYC? I will be out there for a week in July, http://sfchronicle.myshopify.com/, Use a CMS like [Magento](http://magento.com/). You should be able to create dynamic price modifiers (like tax) that can be applied to a group of products.\\n\\nMaybe even Shopify can do this, I\\'m not sure., [I get this kind all the time](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0148/2642/products/ZEIGLERS-APPLE-CIDER_large.jpg?v=1354831730). It\\'s light brown and opaque. , http://sfchronicle.myshopify.com/collections/2015-nba-finals, I do both.\\n\\nIf I set up a development store for a client under my Partner account, when it goes live and turns into a paid plan, it automatically goes under under my affiliate account.\\n\\nI also throw out my affiliate link whenever appropriate.  That works just as well for drawing in extra revenue from people who aren\\'t actually my clients.  Though if I see a new store pop up under my account, I make it a point to reach out to them and introduce myself., Two things came in the mail today.\\n\\nI was lucky enough to get a limited edition [Journey art print](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0580/0965/products/Journey_Web_Print.jpg?v=1429743931) (thatgamecompany; PS3 indie game) a while back, and I just got it delivered. Looks like I\\'m number 126 of 350. \\n\\nI also got a [coin-through-dagger](http://www.play-asia.com/magic-experience-level-2-coin-through-dagger/13/703wc6) magic kit from Play-Asia by accident. I was trying to get FE amiibo and wanted to see what the ordering process was like, so I sought the most inexpensive item I could find that wasn\\'t completely useless in case I couldn\\'t return it. , Go thru apps for magento and other shopify competitors and see if any popular ones don\\'t have a shopify alternative. That\\'d be a slam dunk. Having said that, I guess every other developer is trying this trick, so you\\'d be lucky to find such an app., Hey /u/kickpistol, \\n\\nIt\\'s great to see that you are motivated to start an online business.\\n\\nFirst of all, the market is highly competitive. A bunch of people try to start an apparel brand. It\\'s being unique that helps you out in the long run. \\n\\nIf you want to start simple, I suggest using Shopify. It\\'s an online platform that allows you to run a store. Very cheap entry fee and it allows you to test the market a bit first.\\n\\nHow many \\'fans\\' does your girlfriend have? Does she have a Facebook-page?, Try Vend.  Lots of great detailed and actually useful reports and always improving.  As a standalone product it is awesome and just export your reports for use with your accounting package.  Cannot at this time recommend using it as an add on with any online accounting package (we used it with Xero and had similar problems to your Shopify nightmare).\\n\\nOnly drawback I can see is that you can\\'t just type in a product on an invoice if it hasn\\'t been set up in the system as you said you\\'d have to do sometimes.  They are SO responsive though that I wouldn\\'t bet against them adding that option if you requested it.\\n, These are some fascinating pieces. Any particular reason why you decided to use Etsy over a platform with a little bit more control (something like shopify or bigcartel)?\\n\\nThis would give you more options if you want to play with paid traffic. IIRC Etsy doesn\\'t have an integration with AdWords which would mean you\\'d be flying blind, make your paid visitors potentially buy other products than yours etc..\\n\\nRetargeting is another problem.\\n\\nhttps://instagram.com/gregklassenfurniture/ for instance is using bigcartel.\\n\\nOtherwise - Pinterest, tumblr and Instagram are your friends. Best of luck.\\n\\n, Go with Shopify. That\\'s what we are using on our site right now and we\\'re on the same industry., Thanks! I am planning to download a few things to my iPad tonight and give them test runs at home. Detailed reports sound great. \\n\\nAnd honestly, if adding an item to inventory is fast, it could be a work around... Shopify makes it so items have to be added in browser. You can\\'t add anything within the app. , Get clothing with scotchlite on it too. That stuff lights up like the sun when hit with headlights in the dark. It\\'s far larger and in many cases even brighter (like [this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0183/7587/files/Hi_Vis_Cyclists.jpg) or [this](http://7thmeathscouts.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tn_SDC12439.jpg)) than many bike lights.\\n\\nEven $15 work shirts will do this. No need to break the bank. They\\'re great at dusk too., I have sold enough units to get good reviews, the people \"promising \" reviews never delivered. I\\'ve added site verification, I run through shopify as well..and accept almost every type of payment...What is the site? , Hm, this does seem odd. I\\'m using recharge, which is supposed to take my settings from shopify and do things that way. Going to fix this tonight, thanks for the heads up.\\n\\nThe shipping *is* free, though it doesn\\'t show up on my end either for recurring orders. It *should* add taxes though. Come tax season I\\'ll have to find the ones that didn\\'t add tax and figure out the tax on that, but I think on the receipt I have to show the tax, maybe? Need to email someone with know-how about this.\\n\\nGlad you\\'re loving it! I\\'ll be doing a quiz at the end of all of this to pick out those that don\\'t and to better track how well or terrible I\\'m doing.\\n\\nEdit: Taxes seem to be synced now. Shipping is a bit weird - wish it was more verbal that shipping is free... I\\'ll think on that one., Thanks! The t shirt idea was a last minute thought, what we really wanted to go for was sellingg prints online. In terms of fans, we dont have a facebook page, but you are right; we will start one tonight. I will try out shopify when I get home tonight. \\n, http://pixel-panties.myshopify.com/, +1 for collatz spec, because I\\'m wearing http://store-xkcd-com.myshopify.com/products/collatz-conjecture today :), As others have suggested [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=livekeen) is probably your best bet. These days, you can even avoid the upfront investment of sitting on a stock of shirts hoping they sell; [Printful](https://www.theprintful.com) hooks into Shopify and will produce the shirt and ship it for you as soon as the order comes in.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I used to build Shopify websites for clients a while back. Feel free to ping me if you\\'d like me to walk you through this in greater detail., I\\'d recommend contacting Shopify store owners that you feel are doing an effective job and seeing if they\\'d be willing to share their experience/advice. For example, [this store](http://inkkas.com/) is a Shopify store and they run google adwords and Facebook ads that are targeted., +1, Shopify\\'s main selling point is that it\\'s so simple and intuitive and easy to use, I thought the 1,000 views was fishy since I only really got ~200 from paid ads.  Plus probably a few from myself.\\n\\n-Working on the colors.  But shopify for whatever reason likes to group certain texts all of one color and it\\'s proving to be difficult to change certain text colors without changing others.\\n\\n-I hate the centered look with the big ass margins, but again this is something that I haven\\'t been able to find out how to change easily.\\n\\n-Not sure what you mean by buying a windows license.  I worked for a small CAD company and we were very strict about purchasing legitimate licenses, even though they are annoying and expensive.  For my builds I plan to offer professional, not home, windows., It looks decent on tablets, but yes mobile is not very good.  I don\\'t know really how to fix this.  Shopify to my knowledge doesn\\'t allow you to change major theme elements for different platforms.  It looks like I will have to try some basic coding for this., Decent? Nothing about your site looks decent.\\n\\nJust get basic shopify ffs, Get a 800 number for 10 bucks, fraud apps are most definitely for any purchase from any device desktop or mobile that runs through your shopify store.  they charge 1% for blanket protection, I\\'d recommend the Yotpo product review app for shopify.

I would suggest you start with a free solution to test if there\\'s a demand for what you have. Try posting your stuff on Instagram and then use inselly.com (which is a free tool) to make your insta feed shoppable. You won\\'t find anything that\\'s easier than Instagram + inSelly, that\\'s for sure!, To be fair 40K unique visitors a day is quite a bit of traffic, a free app just couldn’t handle the infrastructure cost: the big difference between an external app and Shopify’s liquid code hack is that in the latter case it’s Shopify’s own infrastructure that handles all the load.\\n\\nHowever, that’s something that can be largely alleviated using clever caching and a well suited architecture. We do support this kind of volume and a few of our customers do flash sales that generate even larger peaks of traffic for a short amount of time.\\n\\nOur app is designed with these requirements in mind, and unlike Shopify’s hack, has access to a lot more data to produce more relevant algorithm-based recommendations, while still allowing manual override., http://shop.beerandbrewing.com/collections/craft-beer-brewing-magazine/products/print-subscription-to-craft-beer-brewing-magazine-including-renewals?utm_source=cbb-shopify&amp;utm_medium=sub-primary-banner&amp;utm_content=dont-miss-issue&amp;utm_campaign=print-subscription, Shopify user here.\\n\\nI use the following apps:\\n\\n* Shopify Reviews (obviously, for product reviews)\\n\\n* Shipping Easy - Integrates with Shopify to easily process orders through to shipment.

The each appear to have pros / cons. , Hey there,\\n\\nThanks for your question.\\n\\nEDLOUD is NOT a marketplace, but like “Shopify for Education” - we help you to successfully sell your education and training products through your own website or a blog.\\n\\nIn comparison to Udemy (or similar marketplaces) this means: \\n1) You can not only sell online courses, but also webinars, eBooks or even (offline) workshops and private tutoring sessions,\\n2) You stay in full control of pricing, marketing and branding,\\n3) You own the customer data and keep the majority of the revenue.\\n\\nA lot of our users sell their products through BOTH their own website AND marketplaces like Udemy. Both models have their own advantages. Let me highlight some of them:\\n\\nMarketplaces like Udemy are good as long as they do marketing for you. But it’s a well known fact that a lot of marketplace partners invest both time and money into marketing their courses there. In this case the marketplace has disadvantages, since even though you invest into acquiring the customer, you don’t own the data and the relationship - instead, Udemy markets “your customer” to your competitors.\\n\\n- They own the customer data and control your communication with your users, \\n- They sell the products of your competition to the users you brought into the marketplace,\\n- They keep a big, big portion of the revenue if you don’t bring the users / do marketing.\\n\\nBeside that Udemy lowers the quality of your videos and adds their watermark. EDLOUD keeps the high quality of your videos and other content, does not add a watermark and allows you to use your content on any other site.\\n\\nWe also make sure that you always have access to full set up and content management services as well as 24/7 customer support.\\n\\nIf you have any more questions, just let us know (happiness@edloud.com) or go to www.edloud.com and pre-register for our private beta and get a LIFETIME discount of 25% when we\\'re live!, Customer Pricing by Bold Apps should be able to help you out., I did.

Straight line cut across toes, not a curved thing that slices toes open\\n* Wedge should be espadrille/rope/cork, not covered in leather. Not wood. \\n* under $100 preferred but at this point i will pay whatever I have to\\n\\nSo far the closest I\\'ve found is [this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0152/4883/products/Jinxxi4.jpg?v=1425497578) but it\\'s not leather, and the wedge is not rope or cork. If possible, I\\'d also like a little taller platform.\\n\\nEDIT: [These](http://g.nordstromimage.com/imagegallery/store/product/Large/8/_7816068.jpg) Michael Kors ones are also very close, but they\\'re a bit too expensive. Basically a cheaper version of this would be awesome., [How they look](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0184/4436/products/Unfinished_Horse_Leader_1024x1024.jpg?v=1434593632), The ones pictured are actually from their Kickstarter release a few years ago, and although they do feel a bit plasticky, they\\'re the most durable pair I\\'ve ever owned... [they\\'re unbreakable! (picture from their Kickstarter campaign)](http://cdn.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Enclave-eyewear-twentyandtwenty-memory-plastic.png)  \\n\\nSince then, however, Enclave have gained more traction in the market and have significantly upped the quality of their materials. For reference, here\\'s the [old model (the one I own)](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8324/8075740609_a8f1ea24cb.jpg) compared to the [new model.](http://bit-post.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/35.jpg) A friend of mine owns the newer ones and they have a much more \\'high quality\\' feeling to them. Plus, they\\'re polarized, feature metal hinges and are dirt cheap compared to the other options out there, priced at $48.00.  \\n\\nIf you\\'re wondering about their [aviator shades](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0166/1270/products/maverickgold.jpg?v=1414698131), I ordered a pair of the small ones last month and they are awesome. Again, great build quality, polarized lenses and to be honest with you, I don\\'t think I could tell them apart from their Ray Ban counterparts.  \\n\\nBasically, Enclave gets my highest recommendation. Although they currently only offer two styles of sunglasses (Wayfarers and Aviators), they\\'ve executed them both extremely well and are so reasonably priced that I wouldn\\'t even consider shopping elsewhere., Do you have a portfolio? In particular have you done ecommerce sites, shopify to be specific.\\n\\nEDIT: I signed up. How fast is the confirmation link supposed to come in?, Guitar amp on batteries http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0453/8833/products/amp_1024x1024.jpg?v=1398201904, I use something [like this](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0203/1620/products/056290_Spatula_1000x1000_1024x1024.jpg?v=1360349957) and just stab stab stab stab., Check out [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/)., definitely a +1 for Shopify, I run a website on shopify - by far the easiest and most scaleable ecommerce solution.\\nThey take a 2% transaction fee though which sucks shit., I would recommend trying the Shopify Community group on LinkedIn - lots of designer consutants there. Or the Shopify Entrepreneurs group on Facebook. , Interesting. I\\'d also love to learn about this and specifically if anyone has tried the new Shopify X Facebook Buy Button integration (https://www.shopify.com/blog/33764868). Would love to hear your experience. , I appreciate your sincerity.  But, to be fair, this thread is only 2 days old.  I think how I\\'ve improved the website says a lot about my concern for the customer.  This is an ongoing process.  By no means was I suggesting that my new website was done.  I just put it up there as a reference.  In fact, I paused my Adwords campaign so as not to waste any more money directing people to a terrible looking website.\\n\\nPart of what I\\'m doing is learning from my failures and missteps.  I\\'m taking this sort of bootstrapping approach more for the learning experience.  Sure, I could pay someone to build me a site, but I value the experience of doing it on my own.  I don\\'t think you can deny that I\\'ve already made major improvements in only two days based on feedback from this community (which wasn\\'t really hard considering how bad my first website was).  Believe me, I intend to make plenty more changes.\\n\\nAt this point, I now realize based on feedback that I need a professional looking site.  Just look at all the comments that agree.  However, you seem to infer that the only way to get a professional looking site is to pay someone or find someone who is better than me.  That being said, I think it\\'s entirely possible to make what you would call a professional looking website with shopify.  If this wasn\\'t the case, shopify wouldn\\'t be in business.  It\\'s obviously worked for others.  I am learning new things every day with shopify and I intend to have a good looking, professional site soon.  If what I create and what I have to offer ultimately turns out to not be as valuable as I think it is, then that will soon become clear and I can move on.\\n\\nIf you care to offer additional critiques, I am happy to read them.  I value your feedback along with the rest of r/entrepreneur.  So, again I say thank you., Shopify is by far the easiest to use and setup. But they eat into your profit margin with the 2% transaction fee and $30 per month charge.\\n\\nUsed to use them then switched to hosting my own website with wodpress/wooCommerce installed on it. There\\'s slightly more work involved but it reduced my yearly fixed costs by $300 (as i didn\\'t have to pay for Shopfiy\\'s service)\\n, Hey, thank you for your feedback!\\nWe\\'ve been looking to improve the mobile side of things (we currently use Shopify). How would you recommend going about improving the mobile version?\\n\\nThank you!, Dam\\n\\nhttp://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0537/4221/products/SDG-SWC-3.jpg, I started my business using Shopify, but left after about 6 months because all of the fees were wrecking my profit margin. \\n\\nAfter leaving Shopify, I did my due diligence regarding research and had narrowed it down to Wix, Wordpress, Weebly &amp; Squarespace. I finally ended up going with Weebly because they had the easiest platform for site building, the most affordable cost and comparable options for selling. It was the best choice I have made to date for my business. \\n\\nWeebly has e-commerce options, so you can easily set up your store and products. I personally decided to use PayPal for my transactions and the great thing about PayPal is that they offer many of the same features as Shopify as far as inventory tracking, plus some other helpful features that don\\'t come standard on Shopify. \\n\\nSince making the switch, I save a little over $500 a month between the hosting fees and transaction fees compared to when I used Shopify. As an added bonus, my customers all love my site and I have since built 4 other websites for my clients using Weebly. \\n\\nGood luck!, [Lazy](http://nice-shot.myshopify.com/), [Abomintation](http://dbliquids.myshopify.com/collections/mints/products/abomintation) from DB Liquids is crazy strong IMO. I gave some to a co-worker and tried to warn him but he took a big rip...the look on his face was priceless., &gt; By no means was I suggesting that my new website was done\\n\\nMy bad. I thought it was ready, that\\'s why I said a couple of hours wasn\\'t enough.\\n\\nShopify is a great tool with lots of options. Don\\'t forget that a thousand tools are useless when you don\\'t know what to do with them, so use them wisely. \\n\\nGet the color scheme right, a nice logo, get some CTA buttons where they\\'re needed and make sure that you grab the visitor\\'s attention quickly. Always put yourself on your clients shoes. It\\'s their input that matters, not yours.\\n\\n\\nGood luck and keep going.\\n\\n , *A giant pile of assorted T-shirts rains down on him.

In fact that\\'s what the WooCommerce creators/devs did when they took Jigoshop and repackaged it as WooCommerce.  \\n\\nWhat you are actually paying for is support (which may or may not be worth it to you).  You are not paying for the code or the ability to use it or any of it\\'s components.  \\n\\nIt\\'s the price of doing business with/under the GPL.  I\\'m not making an ethical argument just letting you know your rights because they make it really murky on whether you need the subscription or not.  \\n\\nAlso, I\\'d recommend going with Cratejoy or Shopify (and a subscription extension/plugin).  **Self hosted is cool but also introduces way too many PCI compliance concerns.**  Which can be summed up by:  99% of shared servers are not PCI compliant regardless of what they say and the only sure fire way of being compliant with WooCommerce is by using a 3rd party hosted shopping cart or an iframe checkout.   Not very elegant. , Reading the faq\\'s they say that you need a merchant account. Either one of your own or a 3rd party processor. If a \"merchant account\" can simply be a business checking account wouldn\\'t it be much more advantageous to transfer funds from shopifys processor to that instead of to paypal so they can take a cut? I must be missing something., You can use shopify, wordpress, or any number of these sites that exist, or if you have it ready, you could have a generic site you made and customize it a little for each website, The Velocity Atty has a bottom feeding pin you can buy (or some of the clones come with an extra).

I have learned 10x as much from my first business ventures than I have from business school! That being said: \\n\\nMake sure that you do your market research. I always see comments about \"niching down\" which is nice, but the fitness apparel line is one that is very flooded with competition, companies with great awareness of their target market and very intense and loyal customer bases. I started a more casual apparel company with the design themed around fitness and we got great feedback and support on social media, we spent months just promoting our brand while we built our online store behind the scenes, we were thrilled to launch... out of all the people that ranted/raved and said they wanted our gear, about 5% actually purchased. \\n\\nMy advice, set up an online store - check out shopify or a similar source if web design isn\\'t your thing. Get everything up and running almost to the point where you are ready to launch (short of taking billing information) and see how many people actually click on the \"buy now\" button. This should help give you a more realistic feel of what you can expect once you are ready to put your money down. \\n\\nThis process can be a pain, but it could help you not end up with a garage full of athletic apparel gathering dust., Shopify has a really cool step by step guide that should be able to answer all of your questions: https://www.shopify.com/blog/14459769-ecommerce-business-blueprint-how-to-build-launch-and-grow-a-profitable-online-store, Cratejoy is like a shitty version of Shopify., One that I hear thrown around a lot with that flavor profile is Brasberry Mint from DB Liquids.

Oh well, Hey thanks for taking some time to investigate.\\n\\nKickfurther is a purchase of inventory.  You\\'re buying a specific product and the business agrees to pay you a consigned rate when that specific product sells.\\n\\nThere is no way you can somehow become liable for business debts.\\n\\nImagine you go to aliexpress.com and buy some inventory.  You have it shipped to Amazon (or another 3PL) and they agree to do order fulfillment for a fee.  You then create an Amazon or Shopify store and market the products.  When you earn a profit on the products you bought and sold, you pay tax on your profit.\\n\\nOn Kickfurther you buy products that brands have a track record of selling.  The brands do order fulfillment.  You even get the ability to sell the products you\\'ve invested in to earn your profits faster.  Taxes are paid on the profits earned.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry that this investment opportunity doesn\\'t appeal to you but I assure you we have put a ton of thought into this concept and we are working with a lot of VERY smart people (including John Donovan, founding member and COO of Lending Club until 2012).  A lot of our power users are diverting funds from their traditional portfolios because they\\'ve seen Kickfurther work.\\n\\nWe have a 0% default rate and have originated almost $300k of inventory since we launched our beta in January.  We\\'ve had $45k of paybacks and that\\'s only ramping up as deal flow moves through the pipeline.\\n\\nObviously it\\'s up to you if you don\\'t want to use Kickfurther, but I just want to make sure the concept is properly understood.  Let me know if you have any other questions and thanks!, Shopify theme Callisto, &gt; There is no way you can somehow become liable for business debts.\\n\\nYou can\\'t just state that as fact, you have to explain why this is the case. It would be the case if I was buying stock in the company, but that\\'s not what you appear to be selling here.\\n\\n&gt; Imagine you go to aliexpress.com and buy some inventory. You have it shipped to Amazon (or another 3PL) and they agree to do order fulfillment for a fee. You then create an Amazon or Shopify store and market the products. When you earn a profit on the products you bought and sold, you pay tax on your profit.\\n\\nThat\\'s fine, and the person doing that would be 100% liable as a sole proprietor for all business debts. If a customer sues that business, the person running the firm is liable.\\n\\nIf I invest in a firm like that, it is no longer a sole proprietorship, it is a general partnership. Both partners now share liability unless they form an LLC (which I don\\'t have control of through your platform). If I am personally buying inventory for the firm, then it appears I am a partner, and as such can be held liable for any and all debts of the firm. If it isn\\'t me investing in the business, but it is a loan, then the service is just a mirror of Lendingtree, and the 1099 tax documents are required along with many government regulations governing lending.\\n\\nI don\\'t see how you get out of this without liability or tax documents.\\n\\n&gt;We have a 0% default rate\\n\\nIt\\'s disingenuous to market yourself with this claim given that you\\'re currently operating on a very small base (so you can cherry pick investment opportunities) and most of your originated debt has not been paid back yet (&gt;80%)., This? \\nhttp://heroicsclothing.myshopify.com/products/a-mo-buckets-m-ball-bucket\\n, yeah that [exotic name](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0184/4436/products/Tennis_Mocha_Studio_Pair_1024x1024.jpg?v=1432055169)\\n\\nI might return them if they turn out to be really dark. \\n\\nEdit: getting Rancourts sometime next month so will decide if i want to keep these.

I personally never went to college, and I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever considered entrepreneurship but it can be a good path to go down.

Its powered by shopify I should add., Your problem is that you\\'re thinking too broadly. \"How do I get started?\" isn\\'t specific enough. \\n\\nYou need to break it down, for yourself. Anyone can get stuff done once it\\'s broken into bite-sized todo items.\\n\\nFor example, \"where do I start?\" == way too broad. You should think: how do I sell a bottle of lotion to someone?\\n\\nWell to do that you need 3 things: (1) a bottle of lotion, (2) a customer, and (3) a way to collect payment.\\n\\nOkay, so next breakdown: (1) how do you get a bottle of lotion? You have a few options. Since you\\'re experimenting with this idea, you could just go to the store and buy one. Or, even better, you could set up the website without ANY inventory and only buy the bottle once someone\\'s bought it from you.\\n\\n(2) How do you find a customer? I\\'d break that down to \"find out who my ideal customer is\" and \"where does that ideal customer hang out online\".\\n\\n(3) This is easy and I can just give it to you... setup a store like Shopify, they\\'ll walk you through the whole thing.\\n\\nThe actual steps I\\'ve given aren\\'t nearly as important as the idea of breaking down a huge idea (\"I want to start a business!\") into smaller, manageable pieces., wow, great advice I\\'ll look into shopify and everything thanks very much!, http://advanced-vapors.myshopify.com/products/authentic-samurai-competition-rda-by-the-cloud-factory, I don\\'t hate the shoes, I wish I could like them - as a brand, they\\'re just not designed with the consistency that I see from other similar sneakers, and most of their offerings seem cluttered.\\n\\n1. The texture on the toe rubber isn\\'t *bad*, it\\'s just too intense. The wear I mentioned earlier creates visible stripes and it adds patterns to an already busy shoe. While the ribbon in the back could add to the shoe, it shouldn\\'t be so busy. One or two tones might be okay, but a wide ribbon with multiple stripes of red, navy, and light blueish gray (their standby) hurts the shoes ability to complement most outfits; the situation would be better if it wasn\\'t there at all. I wish it were pictured online or I would have decided against them.\\n\\n2. The **heel** tab logo being green doesn\\'t turn me off at all (except that it clashes a little bit with the red and navy directly above it). I was referring to the **ankle** logo, in other words, the circular logo that is stitched onto the upper. Some of PF Flyers have a [nice one,](http://images.sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/the-sandlot-pf-flyers-20th-anniversary-10.jpg) but [this newer rubber one](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0575/6381/products/DSC0028.JPG?v=1406352003) that\\'s featured on the majority of their hightop sneakers is just awful. It has too much depth and just looks cheap, and adds to the visual busyness of the entire shoe.\\n\\n3. I\\'m not defending Converse, really - I think they\\'re incredibly uncomfortable and their modern designs are atrocious. But they\\'re the standby, so they\\'re the sneaker by which every sneaker is compared too. (they\\'re also mentioned in OP\\'s post for their striping detail, which is more what this thread is focussing on: details) The first time I wore my PF Flyers out I had a friend ask if they were, and I quote, \"obese Converse.\" It\\'s not my thought, but a common notion (which I have to admit is not *entirely* unfounded) that these are Converse rip-offs. Completely different branding, maybe? but they\\'re both putting out sneakers with a rubber toe cap, textured toe tape, metal eyelets and two ventilation holes, a circular logo on the ankle, two stripes on the sidewall... you can\\'t blame people for noticing the similarities.\\n\\nWhile I really want to like PFs, they just fall short in terms of the design decisions that are important to me. Maybe they exceed yours (fashion is subjective, after all), but in a shoe, I value simplicity, and PFs do not offer that on the level that they could, or should. It\\'s the little decisions that end up making or breaking any design, and I feel like PF\\'s designers makes a lot bad little decisions. Like ending the sidewall tape on the side of the shoe. Maybe if I find another pair for under $20 that\\'s not overdone I\\'ll give them another shot, but for the price, if you want the classic sneaker, why not get the classic sneaker, not its ugly cousin?, So, you can try to contact those companies that provide the products and see how to become a wholesaler. This will give you an idea of how many you need to order to get a good discount.  Be sure to price EVERYTHING because your startup costs might be alot.  You would need Shopify, (as someone said below), actual products, LLC license, custom boxes (pretty expensive actually), packaging, branding, and most importantly, customers.  \\n\\nAs someone who started my own company in the same \"where do I begin\" shoes, I can tell you it takes alot more planning and overwhelming work than you think!

If you want to do easy promotions like triggered free shipping Digix comment is right use Shopify. If you are generating more than $100K or have a list greater than 10,000 already I would go Magento since the extraction out of Shopify and onto your own platform later can be painful. Wordpress + Woo is easy to moderate on the DIY meter. Shopify is easy to moderate (but may nickel and dime you to death something your note said you are worried about) and Magento is high moderate to hard (easy once you are used to it). If this is a hobby Shopify may be enough. If you want to make your living from it I would Magento it so I don\\'t have to extract it later. \\n\\nMarty\\nFounder, Curagami.com , * [Acne Isherwood light wash denim shirt](http://d3pfrs3be80x9y.cloudfront.net/media/catalog/product/cache/27/image/1200x/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/2/1/21I131-143_A_268.jpg)\\n\\n* [Our Legacy silk shirt](http://cache.mrporter.com/prod-img/images/products/514382/514382_mrp_fr_xl.jpg)\\n\\n* [Acne navy Granville linen tee](http://d3pfrs3be80x9y.cloudfront.net/media/catalog/product/cache/6/image/x900/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/2/5/25W131-885_A_689_1.jpg)\\n\\nAlso ordered my sister a birthday present\\n\\n* [MM6 linen coat/jacket](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0137/6952/products/FM021315-615.jpg?v=1423950559), [RM Williams Macquarie](http://i.imgur.com/xnaLYXt.jpg)\\n\\n[Wolf vs. Goat Blue Rose Flannel](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0097/4612/products/IMG_0782_White_Resized_1024x1024.jpg?v=1416879856)\\n\\n[John Elliot &amp; Co U Neck](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0259/3835/products/CurveUneckBlack2.jpg?v=1433367643) in Black and White\\n\\n[Acne Ace Cash](http://cache.mrporter.com/prod-img/images/products/411317/411317_mrp_in_xl.jpg)\\n\\n[Pendleton Western Shirt](https://img1.etsystatic.com/050/1/9180133/il_570xN.702058507_ago2.jpg)\\n\\nUnfortunately, I only have the RM Williams in hand.

However, should you choose to give it another chance, here is a list of things I suggest you improve:\\n\\n**1. Define a product.**\\nYour website does not communicate efficiently what you are offering. Is that information, product or a service? You need to narrow down your offerings. I can see a few possible products you may want to consider: home workout lessons, blog on diet, blog on motivation, motivation counseling as a service, counseling on how to loose weight if you are busy mom, possibly how to incorporate your children into your workout. Another channel is e-commerce: supplements, dieting books,  home workout equipment and etc. Of course, all of these options drastically differ in gross margin and required time investment. Do your due diligence to market research.\\n\\n**2. Target group**\\nWho is your target audience? Are these people already working out and want to improve their routine or they are thinking about working out, but haven\\'t got to it yet? Maybe it is a combination of several segments? Taking into account that you don\\'t have any visitors right now, you have the freedom to choose whom you want to cater to. \\n\\n**3. Design &amp; Marketing**\\nWhen you have an idea what you want to sell, invest some time into changing your design. If you want to kick off an eStore - go with Shopify. If you want to sell information or capitalize on ads, see about either creating a Wordpress blog or taking it to social media like Tumblr, Instagram and such. Adopt a free template with easy to understand information flow. Another side of the equation is marketing or spreading the word about your product, is not my expertise, maybe someone else here will offer a better advice, but I do know that you first need to figure out whom you want to market to. , Pretty much this. I\\'m looking forward to \"For Honor\" for my melee PVP fix. The community in this game is a bunch of whiners, always has been. It\\'s crazy how different gamers can be across games. Just take a look at this shirt made by the fighting game community:\\n\\n\\nhttp://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0057/9482/products/140822_tee_adaptwhite01_large.jpg?v=1408739832\\n\\nAnd underneath the shirt on the page it states:\\n\\n\"Do you know what the most important rule in life is? It isn\\'t begging for others to change the rules for you. It\\'s ADAPTING to your environment and overcoming all obstacles. Be a winner, don\\'t be a whiner.\"\\n\\nSometimes I wonder if the Souls community even knows how to play games in general. The amount of whining coming from a community of gamers that looks down on \"bro dude\" CoD players because the Souls series is oh so difficult (it\\'s really not) is fucking ludicrous.  \\n\\n\\nTime to dust off my arcade stick, I just can\\'t stomach this shit anymore., [Needles Arrow Jacket](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0051/7042/products/ArrowJacketOlive1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1426020797)\\n\\n[New Balance M998](http://havenshop.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/New-Balance-M998-np-1.jpg)\\n\\n[John Elliot +Co U Neck](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0213/3288/products/5_3280f4af-f15f-4df0-9a03-6acbe75e961c_1024x1024.jpg?v=1433979050)\\n\\n, Oh, ok.

Display stuff from Graphite, Nagios, whatever floats your boat., Man I hope you got some savings or unemployment coming in. Im a little nervous for you. Not that you wont make it, dont think that at all. Its just to go from idea, to up and running, to profitable to enough profits to live on  -  not an easy or fast task. Especially without an MVP site or it validated. Godspeed good man. \\n\\nBut if you are serious  - do not pay someone. Learn wordpress, woocommerce, etc. Im on [Shopfiy](http://www.shopify.com/?ref=die-epic) (aff) and its little pricey, but does all the hard work. Eventually I plan on building my own from scratch in background and dumping them. But for getting from built to first $1 dollar they are the best. They do have 24/7 support. Chat and voice. I seriously spent all night xmas on the phone with them going over things. Perfect if you have no prior skills. \\n\\nIf that sounds good, go get a theme (mine was under $200) thats what will make it look good. Then you simply upload, logo, pics, etc..\\n\\nYou can not be a racer car driver with no clue how to fix part of the car. Even if you did it would cost too much to make sense. So learn your online tool/ecomm platform at least high level. Wishing you the best of luck. \\n(Just started a brand/ecomm site from scratch and know its a lot of hard work) , I have more than enough saved, plus i got my payout and am running a few sales on an online auction site to have some cashflow coming in. Yeah I\\'ve heard of shopify and other ecommerce services, it\\'s all a learning experience once I get to that stage I\\'ll see. Could you link your site here? , Shopify plus:\\n1) Theme (under $200)\\n2) Paid for 2 images. #DieEpic one and Skydiver Gif. \\nEvery other thing was me on a chrome book, dslr or cell phone with Over app. The ultimate MVP site. haha.  , Any answer other than a [bumble bear](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0059/1872/products/bumbleclean_large.png?v=1432657430) is inherently false., [This one](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0558/4165/products/strength_red_front_a77a19a5-0d04-4dd1-a637-8d3aea608884_1024x1024.jpg?v=1406847803)\\n\\nHe makes good T Shirts, This.\\n\\nI got [these for like $15 not too long ago](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0248/6808/products/Fils-Mens-Sneakers-Classic-Canvas-1sc10134-976-Black-Gum-Pic1_800d131d-f3e3-4ea0-8fbe-d7f318adc421.jpeg?v=1433509135), I\\'d hazard a guess that you would be too low volume for fulfilment centres to bother with, either that or it\\'s going to be way too expensive. Is there any way you can get the items to the post office yourself for the first few months of business, maybe every 2 days do the post run?\\n\\nOr do you have a friend or relative in a city that can do fulfilment for you?\\n\\nI\\'d use Shopify as it\\'s easier to get started than Woocommerce, and no knowledge of web hosting or development is required at all. Once you get rolling then you can do Woocommerce properly by hiring a developer.\\n\\nMy wife and I launched a small online jewellery shop in Sydney a few years ago. Shortly after we launched however came that big hike in postal fees that threw out all our projections. We\\'ve all but shut it down now and are getting rid of the final stock on eBay.\\n\\nOur main mistakes were:\\n\\n - Over invested in our custom built website when off-the-shelf would have made more sense.\\n - Didn\\'t allocate enough time for marketing and social media management\\n - We were very picky about the products we stocked but soon found out that what suited our personal taste did not necessarily match that of the general public.\\n\\nFeel free to ask any more questions about our experience!\\n\\n, Why do you find Woocommernce better? I like it because of the price (zero), but everyone else seems so pro-Shopify, so I am not sure what I should do., A BJJ belt is always distinguishes rank. Always.\\nBut not every rash-guard is attempting to signify rank.\\nIf I seen somebody at a gym wearing [this rash guard](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0186/7718/products/Rash-BLK-FR.jpg?v=1404425356), I wouldn\\'t think it they were claiming to have a blackbelt.\\nDo you only wear brown rashies?\\n\\nIf its clearly a ranked rash guard, ie anythign that comes in a range of colours, then find a different one imo. But its a random design that happens to be blue/black/purple/etc then go for it, Like wix.  interesting concept.  I see that trend now with shopify., Where in Australia?\\n\\nSeriously just take them to the post office and ship it yourself for the first few months to gauge things. Some 3PL providers don\\'t even do guaranteed 24 hour processing. Unless you\\'re in WA or the NT it shouldn\\'t be a problem. And it\\'s not like labor is an issue if you\\'re only thinking you\\'ll sell one every few weeks. We started off running to the post office once a day until we had the volume to take it to a 3PL provider. I haven\\'t used Woo but I use Shopify. The price isn\\'t a concern (in fact if the costs of using Shopify for a small site is too much then I\\'m not sure I\\'d even bother starting the business) the only thing that concerns me with Shopify is the price of the plugins and monthly recurring on some of them. That\\'s what makes it expensive, but even then you only have to worry about that if you\\'re trying to do higher end things like affiliate programs etc where the costs can be a couple of hundred. Most others are cheap or like Coolence very obviouslypay for themselves., Definitely something paid monthly with live support.\\n\\nI help run an ecommerce store on 3dcart since 2012 after trying out the various solutions available then (Presta, magento, bigcommerce, shopify).  \\n\\nEvery time there were any issues trying to change the store to suit the client\\'s need and if the support database isn\\'t helpful i will go for the online chat.  It has proven to be very helpful and it gives you your answer almost instantaneously allowing you to accomplish your task when you start at it (rather than wait for email response later and then logging back in, etc etc).  , WA, about 80km\\'s from Perth CBD. Closer to the northern suburbs, maybe 45km\\'s. Driving there is doable, but not ideal of course.\\n\\nPrice is not necessarily a huge concern, maybe a worry in the first couple of weeks where the Shopify cost might eat up all the profits of our first couple of sales, but we hope to scale enough to make that $30 look like small change ...\\n\\nBut now have me worry about the plugins. Do I need more than just the standard subscription to make the Shopify experience worthwhile? Which plugins do you recommend and why?, strains of catnip...  who knew?\\n\\nYou guys should accept Bitcoin on your site-  [here\\'s the instructions for integrating with Shopify](https://docs.shopify.com/manual/settings/payments/payment-gateway).

I love them for brick and mortar, but their online store feature isn\\'t ideal. It feels clunky to have to leave your site to go to the store. Doing things like adding multiple items to the shopping cart isn\\'t intuitive. I\\'d recommend Shopify. They have embeddable buy buttons that you can add to your existing site that would probably flow better. , Wordpress with Woocommerce supported theme will give you nice looks and feel plus you can change the theme anytime you want. \\n\\ni had few glances of shopify, I\\'m not impressed with their design., You will likely not need any plugins for shopify, I have 1 and its just for digital downloads. , Can you tell us more about the app?, If you don\\'t want to use the build in blog section then your idea would definitely work. I see a lot of shop\\'s use a subdomain for things like this such as news.myshopifysite.com. \\n\\nYou can link this to wordpress or whatever technology you would like. Can I ask why you don\\'t want to use the blog section? , I thought so, thanks!\\n\\nI just want somewhere to post articles on the latest trending news relavent to my websites content. I would see what\\'s trending/New and post that news on my website with the hope it will bring in more clicks. I feel posting this content under the blog section would make it look less professional., Always good to hear about new Planeteers! They\\'re the most fun live band I\\'ve ever seen.\\n\\nTry anything on [Infinity Cat Recordings](http://infinity-cat-recordings.myshopify.com/). It\\'s their record label, who puts out similar bands like JEFF The Brotherhood and Ed Schrader\\'s Music Beat along with other newer acts from Nashville that follow in the same lineage.\\n\\nAlso, try Titus Andronicus. They\\'ve played together before and share that sort of derailed rollercoaster momentum, but Titus has much deeper songwriting., It can be tricky to figure some of the speed issues out for sure. If you have javascript that can be run at anytime, then try adding the \"async\" parameter to your script tags so that can execute asynchronously instead of blocking the rest of your site.\\n\\n    &lt;!-- Example async script --&gt;\\n    &lt;script src=\"myscript.js\" async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;    \\n\\nCheckout more information here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-async, We\\'re integrating this into a clients site at the moment, later this week I\\'ll be posting a demo URL for a fully styled shop. At the moment we have a beta running, but it\\'s not pretty enough to show!\\n\\nHere\\'s the points I have placed in our beta listing:\\n\\n* Create flexible lookbooks and product catalogues, with features such as image overrides simple product selection.\\n* Launch unlimited lookbooks on your website within a responsive framework that displays beautifully on all devices.\\n* Easy to install, and remarkably flexible, have a professional lookbook configured with minimal effort.\\n\\nWe\\'ll have a nice demo video later this week once the fully styled integration is done. But if you\\'d like to sign up for the beta listing (NO SPAM EVER) we\\'ll advise you when it\\'s good to go.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like, I can send you a link to install the app. There\\'s no charge at this time, but in the future the plan is going to be around $30 per month. Just working out the specifics on that :) , Aiming to improve your Google Page Score is sensible, but it\\'s important to remember it\\'s not the be-all and end-all.

I\\'m setting up an apparel ecommerce site and am extremely short-handed.\\n\\nI\\'ve used them for putting together a logo.  Not them solely developing it.  I had an idea of how I wanted it to look, and just gave them precise directions.  I also gave him freedom to add what he wanted if he didn\\'t think something looked right.  Two revisions later--and I have a decent looking logo.\\n\\nI\\'ve also used fiverr to modify CSS in my shopify template.  I had a GREAT experience.  I asked for a \"M.S.R.P\" and \"Ours\" price underneath the product.  No revisions needed.  Knowing me, I would of spent 6 hours on an editor and gotten nowhere.  Five dollars and I\\'m on to the next thing.\\n, I\\'ve worked out a business plan to sell niche specific clothing. I would like to create a website using Shopify to sell products, but I\\'m unsure if I can just buy products from current retailers to test out the market or if I need to create an LLC and contact the manufacturers or wholesalers of the clothing items directly. I would much rather bootstrap at the begging with less of a profit margin just to see how valid my idea is. Is there a better way to go about this?, You can have different versions of the blog on the same site, so one section may be your normal blog, and you could create a second blog area called \\'Trending\\' (we\\'ve done sites that have 4 or 5 different blogs on them, all doing something slightly different) \\n\\nThey\\'re completely separate blogs and can even have different layouts to them if you want. When creating new blog posts you\\'ll just have an additional drop down next to author that allows you to choose which blog the new post goes under.\\n\\nAs I understand it, from an seo perspective it keeps everything on your main domain then as well which should be better for you rather than introducing a second domain (albeit a sub domain)., Create design concepts. Print on blanks and then sew in labels, or find a tailor you can work with locally to do cut and sew in short runs. Not easy. \\n\\nIf you print on blanks find a local supplier and printer.  You should be able to make a dope tee for 10 or less.  Hoodies around 20 or less. If you can\\'t get the prices down to these levels u can\\'t make money.  Always sell wholesale at 50% markup,  retail at 100%, more if you can. No exceptions unless your giving away for promotional reasons. \\n\\nTake look book photos of your pieces. Never show your brand without dope pics.\\n\\nGet out there and sell inventory, re-invest every penny to create new pieces or collections.\\n\\nSell on the Web at the big marketplaces (ebay, amazon, etc)\\n\\nGet your own web shop going use a service like shopify so it\\'s easy to maintain. \\n\\nIf you\\'re one of the lucky ones you might get somewhere 5-10 years from now.

My criteria is: V at the neck, made in a first world country (US, Canada, Japan, doesn\\'t really matter too much which), and a medium or heavy weight. Loopwheeling doesn\\'t matter to me. So far I have [Tellason](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0565/3549/products/011514_LoneFlag_0298._e_grande.jpg?v=1405575149) in size medium for 100 used, or [Buzz Rickson\\'s](http://www.benchandloom.com/public/uploads/products/large/img201112060494.png) for 155 new. \\n\\nFor context, I am 6 feet tall, and 135 pounds, but putting on weight, so I am not sure if the buzz rickson would fit too short and boxy on me. I would like to wear this sweatshirt over button downs, or under light jackets, and I am getting mixed information on the Tellason, that it is either 16 or 26 ounce fabric. 26 ounces might be crazy (I haven\\'t felt it though), but I think it would fit me a lot better with the longer length. On the other hand, the Buzz Rickson is just sooooooo good looking. I love the white stitching, long cuffs and fabric texture. Should I go with Buzz Rickson or Tellason, or can someone recommend me something else?, Richard Dawkins promotes the scarlet letter \"A\" for Atheist.

If your clients see that your company has no interest in making it easier for them on the eyes, they might go looking for alternatives (like shopify, squarespace, etc) that all offer visually pleasing and utilitarian backend UIs.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, my company right now is looking for a new CMS for that main reason on top of some other small functionality things., No problem at all, give me a shout if you have any issues at all, Are you committed to the paywall model?\\n\\nOne way I could see this working is if you dropped the paywall, added advertising, and added discussion forums/threads. You seem to have an awesome niche that some people will want to talk about every day, which is exactly what you need to turn it into a community. You could even open it up for users to create their own videos and upload them.\\n\\nYou would get revenue from the ads and you could also sell a premium membership with features like being able to download the videos, convert the videos to audiobooks, hide ads, special flair next to their name on the forums.\\n\\nI don\\'t know your market at all so I could be wrong, but I see a potential opportunity to combine basic Youtube functionality with Reddit-like discussion boards, and become THE hub for daily fantasy sports.\\n\\nOTOH, what I\\'m suggesting might be a little ambitious with respect to the technology required. It\\'s certainly much more complicated than the typical Shopify website, you\\'d need serious web developers to implement some of these ideas., &gt; \"Dinar\" and \"Dirham\" are Arabizations of Latin and Greek currency names.

No offense but that looks like a basic Shopify website. You need to speak to your financial department on better ways to allocate that much money. That site could have been easily built for a fraction of that cost and the rest of that spent on SEO, marketing, etc.\\n\\nHoly crap.

What you\\'re seeing is a modified Shopify template that I built myself. Our $18,000 custom website was buggy and unpolished, and we decided to abandon it. It was a very expensive mistake., [This is the pre-amp I built](http://hagerman-audio-labs.myshopify.com/products/cornet3), and [this is the amp](https://tubedepot.com/products/elekit-tu-8200-stereo-tube-amplifier-kit).\\n\\nThey\\'re both fairly expensive, but I think it\\'s just about right on the money, for the quality. The kits were all well documented and I had a blast putting them together. There are cheaper kits available on both sites that I linked to, but these were the best for the setup I\\'m trying to put together., Thanks!  Probably 40 hours or so spread over a few weeks using a basic Shopify template as a starting point., I posted here last week but posting again!\\n\\nI am in the process of starting an online shop selling menswear.

I felt if I spent too much time looking for the ideal price I felt I would end up wasting time. Also I have removed some features that I will implement later so it looks more bareboned than it is. Also my goal was to make a site that looked simple but had many useful custom features that served a purpose rather than act as a gimmick. Thank you for your feedback :) , Shopify is very scalable, and many people use them.

Shipping to the eastern states is going to take a long time. I guess you should still maybe try and start up by shipping yourself but you\\'re really going to have to use a warehouse in Sydney or Melbourne as soon as possible given that is likely where most of your customers are. Even so it probably won\\'t hurt to set it up yourself and see if you\\'re even making enough sales to bother with.\\nI guess you could also focus on being an online retailer specifically servicing WA so they know they\\'re going to get faster shipments, but still, you\\'re not talking about a lot of people over there.\\nYou don\\'t necessarily need any plugins. And some plugins are free, I just remember being shocked at the costs of some of them when I first looked at the platform. I had come from using expensive systems that did practically anything out of the box and paying hourly dev fees for customisations.

It\\'s not as if you need loads of custom development. Good can have a two week turnaround time or less, given all the frameworks and platforms to choose from that do the hard work for you from day one.  At this point, if they propose anything other than Bootstrap, WordPress, WooCommerce, Magento, or Shopify then keep looking.  There hasn\\'t been a need to develop a new way to reinvent the wheel in several years.\\n\\nOf course, this is dependent on you knowing basically what you want ahead of time and not wasting time with tons of needless design iterations., [I\\'m not even trying to be an asshole, but this straight up looks like a penis](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0844/9467/files/orange-expanded.jpg), \"Custom\" is generous.  It\\'s a shopify website.  Honestly I think some of the premium themes are better (and probably less buggy) than most custom themes, including this one.\\n\\nThis actually gets me mad that someone charged you $18,000 for this...., I believe he said they spent 6000 on the website portion and then moved to a Shopify template when the website they paid for wasn\\'t up to par., I used to be a project manager at a security/alarm company.

Took a risk and quit my job to focus on it full time, was barely getting by until Christmas. Had to borrow money just to get shipments out some days. Now I employ 4 people full time 5-6 days a week, constantly expanding our operations. Definitely paid off, had a lot of family/friends telling me to raise prices or close down. I\\'m really glad I didn\\'t listen to them. You don\\'t think of all the expenses that go into making/shipping out made to order juice until you start doing it.

It\\'s the one I wanted, too, so I\\'m jazzed to the max!\\n\\n[***Boom!!!***](http://i.imgur.com/IyvWzlV.gif), &gt;come in and work on these minor edits\\n\\nIt all really depends on what you mean by \"minor\" and \"edit\".\\n\\nThere should be plenty of Ruby devs in DC but I\\'m guessing their rates aren\\'t in line with what you might want to pay? For that matter, why not pay the original dev who actually built it and knows what\\'s going on and could potentially do it faster than it would take for a new dev to get on-boarded or familiar with the project? \\n\\nAbout the changes that you want. \"Minor\" is a relative term. I\\'ve heard it used to describe complex web-apps that would require 20+ models with thousands of lines of code.\\n\\nNow, onto \"edit\"... Do you mean, like, edit actual content? Like, \\'hey, I want this paragraph of text to say something different!\\', or do you mean \\'edit\\' as in editing the logic of the app, as in writing back-end code?  Again, these two things will cost you vastly different rates.\\n\\nIt kind of sounds like either you have an unfinished MVC, or giving you the benefit of the doubt, you just need someone to edit some simple views. The latter is easy if that\\'s the case, while the preceding could potentially be a disaster zone.\\n\\nYou sound like a smart person and I personally don\\'t know any astrophysics myself so I\\'d give you the benefit of the doubt and assume, since you are willing to learn, that you really want to get this done in a reasonable fashion. \\n\\nIf you want to edit html, you can find a folder in app, called, views.  It most likely has ERB or HAML files that is mostly HTML with a bit of Ruby code sprinkled in. Just make sure to back-up or branch your project first. BTW, I\\'m assuming you have the source code here. If you want to add pages, you might check to see if you have a pages folder in the view as well as a pages controller in the Controller folder. Add a method similar to the other methods you see in the controller. Most likely it will have no logic if it is for static content. Then add a view file matching the method name. Then you will need to research adding a route. It\\'s not too hard. It\\'ll be something like `get pages/newpagehere`.  \\n\\nIf you want to actually modify logic or models/tables and or associations, or add views dependant on using logic and or data from the DB, I suggest you hire a dev.\\n\\nIf you have no money for competitive rates, and if you have a public repo (unlikely I\\'m guessing), make an issue describing your feature(assuming github issues here or the equivalent) and post a link and I\\'d be happy to take a quick look, and assuming it didn\\'t require hours to comprehend what you want and even more time to understand the logic and ecosystem of your app, I\\'d possibly make a pull request which you could merge.\\n\\nThat\\'s the benefit of open source btw. I\\'ve dealt with a few potential clients now that had no concept of open source and when I tried to explain it to them, came back with \"absolutely not! I don\\'t want people stealing my code.\"  And yet it\\'s the best way to get cheap or free development on a corporate-sponsored project.  Consider that even Facebook, Google, Airbnb, Twitter, Shopify, and numerous other big players have released code and frameworks as open source.\\n\\n, Consider a managed saas service like shopify. , Yeah I ran the numbers on running a spin off shop and it looked really hard to make money.     Was thinking with Shopify etc it might be the right time to look at running my own shop once I have about a dozen designs ready to go.   I guess I\\'m just nervous about finding the right screen printer.\\n\\nDo you have any advice for finding a good printer to partner with?   I don\\'t even know what to ask them., Sounds like a good deal. I\\'m pretty happy with Shopify. Though I end up paying around $40 / month for it after the few apps I have added. The shipping integration with some of the apps is totally worth it though., Do you get a per transaction fee with Shopify? It looked like you did if you didn\\'t use their gateway. It\\'s nice at least that they let you choose. Squarespace doesn\\'t, but I\\'m fine using Stripe. \\n\\nI\\'m sure Shopify does this too, but Squarespace has Shipstation integration. Their cheap plan will more than cover my needs. I figure I\\'ll try this out for a year and if it\\'s bugging me, switch to Shopify. , The press [always gets it wrong](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0900/3666/products/video-game-violence_1024x1024.png).  \\n\\nAs the inspiration for this product 50% of the net from each sale will go to support leagueofgamers.com in any way /u/Grummz sees fit as noted in the [description](http://vwyw.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/video-games-dont-make-us-violent-lag-does-funny-gaming-t-shirt)., Shopify is great, especially for small shops. Really easy to manage. You want to find a screen printer that uses water based inks, these soak into the fabric instead of sitting on top of the fabric (the latter is plastisol inks, these feel more like rubber). The difference is a softer print, not a plasticky, rubbery print. \\n\\nThe more of a style you print the better your profit margin will be (because of price breaks), id suggest printing at least 72s so that you can make a decent enough profit, if not you are doing a lot of work for not a lot of profit. \\n\\nAlso the more colors in a design, the more it costs to print it. Each color is a film and a screen and these will add on to the cost of printing. \\n\\nI\\'d look around and compare the prices and quality of each screen printer. They will surely have some samples of their work. Depends on the kind of tees you\\'re going to do but you can look at how well they have achieved complicated prints (like photographs etc.) and also how the prints feel. If they feel like rubber or vinyl, then it\\'s not great quality (unless they intentionally wanted that effect)\\n\\nhope that helps, good luck, 2.9% + 30¢ for Credit Cards through Shopify Payments. Otherwise standard PayPal fees. It\\'s an additional 2% for a different gateway but I use what they offer. No transaction fees beyond that though.\\n\\nI actually use Shippo and there is no monthly fee (which I like). Just $0.05 per shipment which isn\\'t much in the grand scheme of things for how often I\\'m shipping., Give me a bit and I\\'ll add it to my store.\\n\\n[Added](http://vwyw.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/they-hate-us-cause-they-aint-us-funny-pro-america-t-shirt)., [yew](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0379/2257/products/michael-divine-bicycle-day-blotter-art-scan-sm_1024x1024.jpg?v=1398016808), [Store](http://vwyw.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/they-hate-us-cause-they-aint-us-funny-pro-america-t-shirt).\\n\\n, The website looks clean &amp; simple  which is the smartest thing to do.\\n\\nHere are some of my critiques that I noticed while quickly glancing through your website.\\n\\n-When in the products listing, when I hover my mouse, I personally don\\'t like \"Add to Cart\" black, it feels unprofessional, try changing your color or check your competitors/big sites on how they do it. It is hard to read it.\\n\\n- http://mandalatibet.com/collections/malabead?sort_by=price-descending , there are \"2\" blank spaces for you to add your products to?  Same with other \"Sort By\"\\n\\n- Self-Branding, your logo feels \"pushed away\" . I\\'m a guy who believes it\\'s very important to build a good reputation to your brand. You will have a larger customer-base and also you can charge more due to the \"Brand\". I\\'d defo change the positioning of your logo. ESPECIALLY in the products page where there is no search bar, feels off.\\n\\n- http://mandalatibet.com/collections/all - there is a large gap between your header and the heading \"Products\".\\n\\n- Make your favicon transparent. The \"white\" behind that circle should be removed.\\n\\n- When you switch over from \"Details\" to \"Shipping &amp; Return Policy\" the texts of the two sort of crash into each other, why not just make it instant without any special effects?\\n\\n- Product page, when I want to view the listing as 1 per row instead of 3 per row, nothing changes? However if I set \"16\" per page, it changes fine between the rows.\\n\\n- In the \"cart\" page, the paypal button touches the \"Proceed to Checkout\" .... Why is there a PayPal button there in the first place? Are you giving your customers two options? Add a \"OR\" in between then.\\n\\n- \"Made with ♥ in New York by Minion Made. Powered by Shopify.\" part of that text is white, making it impossible to read.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve actually written a blog post the other day on how you can increase your conversions which I highly suggest you read: [10 Ways to Boost Your Conversions by Over 232%](http://yokohub.com/10-ways-to-boost-your-conversions-by-over-232/). Install Hotjar and track exactly what your visitors are doing, a very easy yet effective way to see what\\'s wrong with your website and where you can improve.\\n\\nMy critiques do include minor issues, however don\\'t neglect them. Small things like that can affect your sales. Do let me know if you have any other questions, I\\'ll be glad to help.\\n\\n\\nLuka, Nope. It\\'s either the Shopify fee or PayPal fee. If they pay via PayPal, Shopify doesn\\'t charge me anything (no additional transaction fee)., Check out Bullzerk in Lower Greenville\\n\\nhttp://bullzerk.myshopify.com/\\n\\n, [From these fine folks.]( http://cryptograffiti-bank-shirts.myshopify.com) Very prompt delivery also., Recent Submission history for nooruzz:\\n\\ndomain submitted from|count|%\\n:-|-:|-:\\n[synup.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27synup.com%27+author%3A%27nooruzz%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|7|16%\\n[self.bigseo](/r/bigseo/search?q=%28and+author%3A%27nooruzz%27+is_self%3A1+%29&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|6|14%\\n[self.smallbusiness](/r/smallbusiness/search?q=%28and+author%3A%27nooruzz%27+is_self%3A1+%29&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|6|14%\\n[smbstash.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27smbstash.com%27+author%3A%27nooruzz%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|5|11%\\n[localseochecklist.org](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27localseochecklist.org%27+author%3A%27nooruzz%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|5|11%\\n[medium.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27medium.com%27+author%3A%27nooruzz%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|3|7%\\n[self.localseo](/r/localseo/search?q=%28and+author%3A%27nooruzz%27+is_self%3A1+%29&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|3|7%\\n[self.marketing](/r/marketing/search?q=%28and+author%3A%27nooruzz%27+is_self%3A1+%29&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|2|5%\\n[self.startups](/r/startups/search?q=%28and+author%3A%27nooruzz%27+is_self%3A1+%29&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|2|5%\\n[business.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27business.com%27+author%3A%27nooruzz%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|2|5%\\n[reddit.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27reddit.com%27+author%3A%27nooruzz%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|1|2%\\n[shopify.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27shopify.com%27+author%3A%27nooruzz%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|1|2%\\n[blog.raventools.com](/search?q=%28and+site%3A%27blog.raventools.com%27+author%3A%27nooruzz%27+is_self%3A0+%29&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new)|1|2%\\n\\nsubreddit submitted to|count|%\\n:-|-:|-:\\n[bigseo](/r/bigseo/search?q=author%3A%27nooruzz%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|11|25%\\n[SEO](/r/SEO/search?q=author%3A%27nooruzz%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|8|18%\\n[smallbusiness](/r/smallbusiness/search?q=author%3A%27nooruzz%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|6|14%\\n[web_design](/r/web_design/search?q=author%3A%27nooruzz%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|4|9%\\n[localseo](/r/localseo/search?q=author%3A%27nooruzz%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|3|7%\\n[advertising](/r/advertising/search?q=author%3A%27nooruzz%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|3|7%\\n[startups](/r/startups/search?q=author%3A%27nooruzz%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|2|5%\\n[content](/r/content/search?q=author%3A%27nooruzz%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|2|5%\\n[marketing](/r/marketing/search?q=author%3A%27nooruzz%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|2|5%\\n[business](/r/business/search?q=author%3A%27nooruzz%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|2|5%\\n[GrowthHacking](/r/GrowthHacking/search?q=author%3A%27nooruzz%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)|1|2%, Hi it seems you are looking for a job in following categories : [#Design](http://wanna.work/t/Design) [#iOS](http://wanna.work/t/iOS) [#WebDev](http://wanna.work/t/WebDev) \\n\\nPerhaps you would be interested in following job offers : \\n\\n[[Hiring] Web designer](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/3arz8i/hiring_web_designer/) #Design #WebDev \\n\\n[[Hiring] (Online) Web developer &amp;amp;

His site went viral and he had 1000s of orders come pouring in and he cracked it. If that had been a woo commerce store, on some cheap host, l guarantee you his site would have crashed and burned from the traffic. \\n\\nShopify is designed specifically to be used for ecommerce. \\nWordpress is designed specifically for using as a blogging platform. The only reasons I can see for using woocommerce is if you already really knowledgeable about using  wordpress or you are  dead broke and a few bucks a week is  going to be a  strain on your finances.\\n, My take on this is that if you\\'re not that technical then Shopify is a great way to go. They handle all traffic as it\\'s hosted with them, and their starter package is dirt cheap ($14 a month or something). Grab a nice theme and you\\'re all set.\\n\\nWooCommerce is a good idea if you\\'re more technical and need custom development/dispatch stuff written on top of it. , &gt; ecommtalk.com/shopify\\n\\nPM\\'d you (:, did you draw these? or rip them from the net, looks a little like band merch, don\\'t know if thats a good thing or bad. typography looks nasty though.

I left without one last time and struggled to find one again but boy did I miss it. \\n\\n, Actually Wordpress is a CMS and you\\'d be surprised at the sites that are run on it. And get this, facebook is built on Wordpress (granted a heavily modified version, but still).\\n\\nThere are actually plugins designed to handle major traffic hits like what you\\'re talking about. I\\'ve got a site built on WooCommerce that would smile at traffic like that. \\n\\nA big part is the host, but that\\'s true for any CMS.

I think you have to have a basic understanding of how that works before you get into setting up a shop etc. whereas with Shopify, you can one-click install a theme and be away - you just don\\'t have to touch anything technical unless you want to.

They\\'re in the process of moving everything from the CT online store to the Omnian Music Group store., We are using Shopify at the higher levels.  It runs us $179 a month plus the offsite cost of email ($60/year, but could be free through Zoho.)   We paid about $2,000 to have the site built by a freelancer, which was money well spent.

It\\'s an add on on Wix and costs about 19 usd a month, I think Shopify just added Google Wallet to available payment methods. Will try and get that setup this week.

Try Volusion or Big Commerce. , I personally love [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/). It\\'s amazingly awesome to template and has a ton of options., First, you\\'ll have to get a medicine spoon, most places like Walmart or Fred Meyer will give them out for free at the pharmacy if you ask. Then you\\'ll cut it down to just the spoon bit with maybe 2 inches left attached. Then, you can either get the hard vinyl tubing shown in these photos at most hardware stores and simply shove it in the end of the spoon (I personally use some kind of sealant, like this, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0411/5921/products/8277_WaterWeld_10.8.14.jpg?v=1419965253 to seal the tube and spoon together, but whatever works.) Or, for a softer and much more pleasant stp, I\\'ve been told this works to stretch over the end of the spoon http://m.ebay.com/itm/261155228827 (I\\'ve used a different method to achieve the same end result, but this seems simpler, assuming the tubing is big enough to fit over the spoon.)\\n\\nAny more questions, feel free to ask.\\n\\n*edit* spelling., We\\'d like to do that pretty soon.

But for something like \"Hey, can I get some quick feedback on this idea!\" or \"I need someone who can quickly explain to me what shopify plan is the best for my project.\" I feel something like a communication platform like Slack is better. We have different channels for different topics like #currentprojects or #idea-dump where you can quickly chime in, get into a nice discussion and then leave. Also most of the time in a chatroom you have better luck getting answers for quick answers like that, on a forum like reddit they mostly go under between all the posts that have topics which more people are interested in.\\n\\nAlso I have subscribed to some \\'Beginner Entrepreneur\\' subreddit but most of them just went inactive after a few days.

Now you couldn\\'t pay me to set up another store on their platform. Their hidden transaction fees incurred if you don\\'t use the awful \"Shopify Payments\" option are a joke - so is the fact they constantly muck about with the dashboard in the back end, the checkout and so on, without giving you an option to leave your site as it is. Shopify is rubbish, Big Commerce or Volusion offer better value for money and far superior support., Our app can do Amazon for you, but due to non disclosures I can\\'t publicize it on unofficial social media accounts. Shoot me a PM and we can setup a demo., Thank you for looking deeper. This kind of examination of the root cause helps debunk the myth of instant riches from becoming a middleman. I would love it if this link and so this comment ended up being the top Google result for searches on \\'Shopify\\' and \\'setting up a business\\' just because it would get people to dig a little before they believed what they read., Why not just use shopify payments and avoid the fee?\\n\\nI finally migrated my parents\\' ancient ecommerce site to shopify.  I have some love/hate issues with it:\\n\\nLove that:\\n\\n- it\\'s fast and seems secure\\n- easy to setup and get going\\n\\nHuge annoyances:\\n\\n- No virtual terminal or POS app for android.  Which means if you need to do custom pricing/shipping/etc, you HAVE to have an iOS app.\\n\\n- Adding any kind of custom data fields to templates are a pain in the ass and require using the API or a 3rd party chrome extension\\n\\n- No way to do 301 wildcards.  If you have 200 old pages that you need to map from /whatever/ID to shopify\\'s /pages/ID, you have to manually enter every one.  There\\'s a CSV import tool, but I\\'d much rather have a single 301 regex expression than 200 entrants.\\n\\n- Similar to above, you can\\'t change the URL structure.  You\\'re stuck with /collections, /blog/{crazy-id}-slug, /pages/, etc\\n\\n- You can\\'t customize the checkout page at all.\\n\\n- Obviously limited to the Shopify payments/stripe\\n\\n- No control if they decide to increase pricing later\\n\\n- No built in email (I use google apps for work since I still have a free account)\\n\\n- Real time shipping quotes aren\\'t included for free\\n\\nOverall though, for around $26/month (1yr subscription), it\\'s a pretty good deal for small carts that don\\'t need any fancy features., Well, i think the title was \"how shopify\\'s blog team\" built the business, not \"how everyone can build this business and have the exact same results\", Can I ask a noob question, At what point do you begin paying for shopify? Like can I set up a test site there for free, then just begin paying when I want to \"go active\"?, [Like these ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0455/0745/products/Studio_Session-0114_1024x1024.jpg?v=1425158186), [The fact that they couldn\\'t afford to actually take a pic of their painted gamecube controller for this image on their site, is a red flag for me.

Shopify will be the easiest to quickly set up, but has the most expensive fees I believe.\\n, Wahhhh someone has a personal shopify vendetta, 4) You wanted [this shirt](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0378/2569/products/backtobacktank_grande.jpg?v=1432748750), Thank you so much for you advice. We want to eventually turn it into an eCommerce site. Do you have any recommendations of what to use to start that? I have seen sites like shopify, would that site work? or is there a better alternative?  , I really like your business, it\\'s very should I say \"different\". As for your website, try checking Shopify out! I\\'m currently in the process of setting my e-commerce business up selling niche wrist watches. The support you\\'ll get from Shopify staff is 24/7 and is fantastic! Very supportive and great advice they give too.  \\n\\nAs for eBay, I\\'ve been selling on there for the past 4 years now. You really need to bump your feedback up. I highly recommend you sell at least 10-15 items you have laying around which are unwanted, to help boost your feedback up :), Okay I will look into shopify. Do you happen to know how much it cost to have them basically run your entire site except the shipping and making the product? I agree with you on the eBay thing that\\'s why I\\'m selling my old PS3 and I plan on putting some other things on there shortly. Thank you for the advice!, Here you go: [Lucky Iron Fish](http://lucky-iron-fish.myshopify.com/products/lucky-iron-fish)., **spam**: \"irrelevant or inappropriate messages sent on the Internet to a large number of recipients.\"\\n\\nIf this article is indicative of Shopify \"spamming\" the sub, then I\\'m not sure you know what the word means., I guess they tamed it down although I now see another thread regarding shopify so maybe not, Shopify will be your best bet. Goodluck!, [This almost sounds familiar...](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0228/9021/products/does_rocks_art.jpg?v=1395179613), I would recommend Shopify for your purposes because it has a ton of free apps that require no coding experience and work flawlessly to enhance your site. Kinda like how an iPhone is just a phone without apps. $29/month with credit card processing and paypal integrations., Nothing wrong with that. Though I would much rather do the Pelican one then even attempt to do [this](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0665/3611/products/halo-mms293-mantis_309c836c-584b-4b95-913c-ae99a3705eda_grande.jpeg?v=1427304244) one. I would go mad.\\n\\nAlso, always wanted to start a Imperial guard 40k army, but My sub par painting skills and games workshop ludicrous prices for the models put a damper on that idea., Thanks for the reply, if you want to build you 1st eCommerce website then you will get idea for these sites,\\nShopify\\nMagento\\nBigcommerce\\nWooCommerce\\nWebs\\n3dcart, We\\'ve used Stripe (which is the processor used by Shopify Payments) on a different project. I would say around 25% of transactions are declined for \"possible fraud\". For whatever reason, a lot of banks here in the UK don\\'t like Stripe. The project we used Stripe on was only small, but we had endless calls and emails from frustrated customers whose cards had been declined and in some cases frozen by their bank. We cannot afford to repeat this scenario by using Shopify Payments. It\\'d be an absolute disaster given the volume of sales we do., I respectfully disagree. It is not a coincidence that the article mentioned making a very respectable amount of money in a VERY short amount of time (3 days). \\n\\nThey are trying to argue that with Shopify or online commerce in general, you can be up and running and raking in significant profit almost overnight.\\n\\nNoone would read a title like \"How We Built an Ecommerce Business from Scratch and Generated $922.16 in Revenue in 3 Days \" and think that this was a \"get rich slow, invest-time-money-relationships\" situation. , That\\'s not the point. The point is that the Shopify bloggers make it look far too easy: Get a drop shipper, design a label and press a button to receive profits.\\n\\nThe blog post is a nice marketing gag - but shouldn\\'t be taken as a feasibility analysis because they use an advantage that most people won\\'t have (buddy at a popular shopping aggregator list). It\\'s like those people who got into the app store and never made back their $100 because they knew no one at Apple or Google to feature their apps.\\n\\nNot saying you shouldn\\'t try to run a business. But it\\'s harder than it looks like., So how repeatable/sustainable is this? Will you get every week/day on product hunt? Can you spam reddit or your friends every week to get a few sales? If you win the contest and get the business what are you going to do if you don\\'t have a buddy at product hunt? Make losses by buying Facebook ads?\\n\\nNice marketing gag from Shopify. But nothing more. Well except proof that you can paddle any kind of crap if you only know the right guy. Even if your idea isn\\'t sustainable otherwise on the market. , [Oohi](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0240/6253/products/80_219_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1371069420), To answer your specific question - no, there\\'s not really a way to inject Stripe into Shopify\\'s checkout process and take a cut.\\n\\nCan I suggest a much simpler solution? Just ask to keep an account in their Shopify Admin with access to their order data, then invoice them each month appropriately., I\\'ll take that as a yes.\\n\\n/u/Manassisthenew6pack, let me introduce you to [Jeff Seid](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0098/8822/files/Jeff_Seid_Picture_large.jpeg?3255), Yeah, but [theirs](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0753/1581/files/blog_swastika.jpg) is pointed the other way., Thats odd, many of the juice vendors use shopify.  What happens when you try to sign up for the service?, &gt;  To answer your specific question - no, there\\'s not really a way to inject Stripe into Shopify\\'s checkout process and take a cut.\\n\\nNitpicking - but, there is *technically* a way, but it is a royal pain in the ass.  Recreating a checkout using the visitor\\'s cart, that obeys proper tax rules, and the owner\\'s settings, can be done.  I spent quite a bit of time on something similar (trying to make a checkout that does subscription AND one-off products concurrently).  Can also be set up to automatically calculate &amp; take a cut of the Stripe account... but there is so much potential for abuse, I don\\'t think any sane business owner would allow that.\\n\\n&gt;  Can I suggest a much simpler solution? Just ask to keep an account in their Shopify Admin with access to their order data, then invoice them each month appropriately.\\n\\nI have an idea for a slightly more automated process.  Private Shopify app, that grabs total monthly sales data.  At the end of the month, it figures out the appropriate cut, and sends the info along to the PayPal invoicing API which will generate and send out an invoice to the client.  (I\\'m sure there are other invoicing systems that could be used, I\\'m just most familiar with PayPal), Yeah, I cant remember where I ran across it for shopify, but it was back under the old shopping cart (which uses checkout.css) and had to adapt to the responsive one when they forced it on us.\\n\\n, You can use shopify for the site but you can\\'t use them as a payment gateway even though it\\'s free and all. They emailed me a couple weeks back saying we can\\'t use then because we\\'re a vape shop. , I would get rid of discount button and bottom bar. Tighten up the main page so i can see the product and price without having to scroll down. \\n\\nthe font on the about us page is hard on the eyes. \\n\\nset up favicon for the site/page, there is a setting in shopify\\n\\nwhen i click \\'store\\' huge text saying \"the store\" is not needed or pleasant. again as much products (with prices)  as the customer can see without having to scroll is good for adds to cart. \\n\\nThat\\'s the stuff that jumps out at me , for the moment . all pretty easy tweaks if you think they make sense. \\n\\nSomething you should look into is for \\'locations\\' a interactive map and a search by zip. Again this supports your supermarket sales and reorders. A website is not just for sales it along with your labels are the rue face of your company.\\n\\n, The \"locations\" apps I have found for Shopify all wanted crazy money per month.

Gracias sir.\\n\\nEdit: [sure enough!](https://troegs-brewey-store.myshopify.com/collections/glassware/products/troegs-logo-splinter-beer-glass), I use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) on the eCom stores I\\'ve setup. Their card processing fee is 2.9% + $0.30 but that\\'s the only fee. No monthly crap or additional fees or anything. I think it plugs into shopify nicely as well., Shopify is a great platform.  Ive played around with it. If yoh are a beginner it will be a lot easier than doing woocommerce or similar.  \\n\\nHowever something I only just learnt that sucks about it is they charge you 2% on every transaction. That is quite outrageous in my opinion as if you are using another payment processor you will still have to pay this.  So essentially you sre doubling up on fees. This can really start adding up, It\\'s sad but it seems that being an entrepreneur is as easy as making a site on shopify and selling a knock off of a knock off.....\\n\\n, Where were you a few months ago when shopify kicked me out for being high risk. My processing bank isn\\'t a cool redditor like you guys, Thank you so much for this guide, for a noob like me it is greatly appreciated. Just wanted to get your thoughts on using shopify? Thank you again., We\\'re really going to need at least the State you\\'re in to know what\\'s available .\\n\\nRecommendation:  try different types of beer from different breweries to understand the styles you like.

They sell road trip tickets through their [store](http://screaming-eagles-online-shop.myshopify.com/collections/roadtrips), so you\\'re guaranteed to sit with other supporters and tickets are cheaper than what you would buy from the other teams stadium., Do you mind explaining a bit more? Sorry I am not sure I understand. I currently have my own site, hosted on my own server and use paypal. Paypal charges like 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. I was looking to switch over to Shopify because it looks like it has nice templates, can add google wallet, bitcoin, etc easily and has good analytics. \\n\\nIf I understand you correctly, Shopify charges 2% on top of the fees paypal, google wallet and it\\'s own credit card? So If I used Shopify to process payment it would be 2.9% + 2%? Or Paypal\\'s 2.9% + 2%?, Don\\'t quote me, but if you use paypal then yes you pay paypal their 2.9% and then wil have to give shopify their 2% cut. At least this is what tbey told me in their support. Not sure how they bill that out. \\n\\nThey also have their own shopify payment processor which if you used this would cut out the double take. And youd just pay whatever shopify charges for this which bis around 2 to 3% I believe, Let me clear one thing up first: You can be a web-developer and not work on your own. I work for a small advertising company. Everyone else in the office is a designer. I program the websites and turn their print designs into web designs. It\\'s a totally autonomous job as far as development goes - I can do it any way I like. Still, I don\\'t work alone.\\n\\nThat being said: \\n\\n&gt; For a while now I have been learning web development and am getting fairly decent now to the point where I think I am ready to start building sites for others, on my own time, after work.\\n\\nDo that: You could start by finding a small business or two who has a static (non-database-requiring) website that *should* be updated, then build it out (partially) and present it to them. They\\'ll likely offer you a few hundred bucks to finish it. That\\'s a start. Use things like this to get your portfolio up.\\n\\n&gt; Did you just use word of mouth?\\n\\nI am one of the 1 in a 1000: I got hired at my current job from Craigslist. Can\\'t recommend that really, but I can say don\\'t ignore it entirely.\\n\\n&gt; One of my biggest fears is that I will get hired for a small project and then discover some issue that I simply cannot solve, end up spending hours a day on it, and then fail miserably.\\n\\nYou might. Deal with that fear, it won\\'t go away for a while. And you know how to already:\\n\\n&gt; The idea of this happening is a bit ridiculous because I could always go get help from people online, I guess.\\n\\nStackOverflow and similar websites are your friend. Don\\'t be ashamed: All of us use them. *All of us*. If you\\'re a webdeveloper as a professional and you don\\'t find yourself visiting StackOverflow at least once a week, you\\'re probably not really a professional (or you\\'re, ya know, a god).\\n\\n&gt; So what advice do you guys have for someone considering started out working in web dev on their own?\\n\\n*Make realistic deadlines and stick to them*. If it\\'s going to take 3 months, you might consider estimating 4 at the start. Get a sense of how long a project will take and really try to stick to it. Projects go unfinished because people forget deadlines or don\\'t have them at all. \\n\\n*Communicate with the client: Don\\'t be a \\'yes\\' man*. Figure out what they *need*, not necessarily what they want. They\\'ll want more than you can provide or more than what\\'s necessary. For instance, blogs: For the longest time, everyone *wanted* a blog on their website. Window companies, shirt companies. Whatever: If they aren\\'t going to update it *routinely* (once a week), they don\\'t need it, and it will be a sore thumb: \"This company doesn\\'t update their blog\". It\\'s better to not have one than have one and have the last post be from two years ago. On this note: Don\\'t sell things like a blog or an image gallery to a business that doesn\\'t need it. \\n\\n*Don\\'t reinvent the wheel*. Need to make a website with a shopping cart? For godssakes use Shopify or something similar. \\n\\n*Learn to use frameworks*. Bootstrap is your friend, if you learn to work with it, not against it. This applies to nearly any framework; find one you like. I simply prefer Bootstrap but lately it\\'s feeling bloated. \\n\\n*Learn to read proper documentation*. [Install this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/w3schools-hider/igiahejkpbnbnekdaefddmdceocmjpll?hl=en-US) and never look at W3Schools again. Use MSDN or MDN or similar. It\\'ll be a bit more confusing at first but the ability to read proper documentation is such an underlooked ability in this industry: If you can\\'t, you really aren\\'t a professional at all. A good trick for learning to read proper documentation is reading documentation on things you already feel confident in. You\\'ll learn things. Trust me.\\n\\n*Keep up on the day-to-day news in the industry*. You\\'re already doing that by being subbed here. I\\'d suggest /r/web_design too. You\\'ll keep your mind sharp and your creative juices flowing.\\n\\n**Edit!**\\n\\n*Learn to be okay with dropping a client.* You\\'re going to have bad clients. We all do, it\\'s unavoidable. Remember they are not a *customer*, they\\'re a *client*: The customer is always right, not the client. Have contracts requiring they provide materials you\\'ll need (have an itemized list ready of what you will need, and try to have it be complete the first time), then require them to have that material ready by X date, else you get the option to drop the project and keep the initial payment. Oh, you\\'ll figure out how to work out payment structures, but I find it\\'s best to keep it simple: Pay me half to get me started, the rest on deployment of the website. If I have to drop you as a client between start and finish, I keep that initial payment, no questions. This policy serves to keep them aware that you\\'re dependent on them as much as they are on you, and it puts a fire under their ass to get you what you need. Your biggest frustration won\\'t be being asked to make something you never have before: It\\'ll be a client who is hard to reach and demands results after having not provided you with everything you need. If they\\'re pinching pennies and trying to get you to work cheap, that\\'s a red flag. This is not a cheap business; don\\'t sell yourself short.  , How is shopify for Seo?, Ya, that\\'s true.  I mean, honestly, once you have access to manipulating any page, it\\'s game over.  That could be said of any website though really, not just ecommerce ones.\\n\\nMany of these reasons are why I decided to move my parents to Shopify so I don\\'t have to worry about this crap anymore.  (I was using Authorize SIM on their old site)., Bought a [Russian Circles hoodie](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0015/2602/products/rcheadlesshood_grande.jpg?v=1361172087) I\\'ve had my eye on for a while. A little pricey, but it\\'s AA and it\\'s comfy as fuck, so it was worth it. First merch I\\'ve bought in a while., They popped up on [MassDrop](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/inked-and-screened-patent-prints?s=inked) a little while back and it looks like it might happen again soon, otherwise they are from [Inked and Screened](http://inked-and-screened.myshopify.com/) , Is this not the Service Boot? On their website I see [this image](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0360/4821/products/7060CN0N1.jpg) for Charcoal Nubuck., I would say Shopify might work for you - though its not free, it is pretty nice. You can blog and build pages and your own navigation if you like. \\n\\nYou can make your own themes and upload it, you would have to learn their template language though (Liquid I think). I feel like I read they were ditching Liquid if they haven\\'t already, I haven\\'t used Shopify in some time, so I don\\'t know what they\\'ve added on to it, but its definitely worth looking into. \\n\\nThere is no exposed HTML interface as you are requesting, all development is done on your own system - which is only front end development., I was just having a look at the *resources* section - aka blog - of the hello matcha tea site, and it looks like they forgot to change some links in [this post](http://www.hellomatchatea.com/blogs/resources/17398092-matcha-cookies), which is a copy/paste job [from here](http://www.coffeebeandirectblog.com/recipes/matcha-cookies-a-new-spin-on-an-old-favorite/). It links directly to [this product page](http://tattletea.coffeebeandirect.com/yame-matcha-green-tea-powder.html) btw.\\n\\nNow you can start your own tea dropship business w/o entering shopify\\'s contest. I\\'ll take a 10% royalty on all future sales as a finders fee, K?, thx., Seconding Shopify, particularly if you are a B2C business. They have a very intuitive administrative interface (I have never heard a complaint from any of the clients I help set up on Shopify), and no need for a developer or designer if you\\'re happy with the themes they have available and the out-of-the-box functionality.\\n\\nGood luck!, I use [screened double jar feeders](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0267/0619/products/double-jar-feeder-side.jpg?v=1425001744). It means I store an extra box on top of my hives, but hey, extra box ready when I need it. Because of the screening, it means that top box is a bee safe environment, allowing anyone who knows to approach the hives from the side or behind to have a relatively insect free encounter with the hives., No, it sounds like you were given bad info. I just migrated to Shopify and the deal is, as long as your offering the Shopify/Stripe payment gateway as one of your payment options, you won\\'t incur the 2% across the board transaction fee, even on transactions that elect to use another payment method other then Shopify. So it\\'s really not so bad, they just want their gateway to be one of the options your offering.\\n\\nEdit: Cc: /u/clocloetdata, /u/mastercpt, I spoke with one of their support. He told me say I had paypal I would have to pay my paypal fees of x% but then incur 2% from shopify. That sounded odd I must say I kept asking why I have to pay them processing when they arent processing.\\n\\nAnyway I will go and ask them again, seems kind of important to know. \\n\\nApologies to all if im wrong, but youd think it would be enough to rely on the word of shopify support, These are the ones!\\n\\nhttp://becautoparts.myshopify.com/collections/tail-lights/products/vw-golf-6-led-tail-lights-dark-red, I believe your support representative is right. In my understanding, if you use Shopify payments, you won\\'t get charged. But if you are going to use a third party gateway, they will charge you 2.2% to 2.9% depending on your plan for the transaction fee plus the third party\\'s transaction fee. , [XT12](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0712/4839/products/KlarusXT12cord_1024x1024.jpg?v=1432923718), maybe? Could you take another picture of it closer to your lamp?, That\\'s a little misleading. When you look at what square would charge for payment processing integration and what shopify charges for their shopify payments options (powered by square) its about the same. It\\'s only when processing with PayPal or some third party processor that you get charged 2%. Go look at their price page before making your decision OP. \\n\\nEdit: a word., shopify.com is free for 2 weeks, I\\'d use that.\\n\\nWhy the need for wordpress?

Orders today will ship on Monday! free 2-day shipping for domestic orders., I wrote the piece, and as far as I can tell it does not include merchandise sales, which are handled through Shopify.

So the booming market is construction right now and any services associated with real estate (mortgage, banking, architecture, design). Soon, retail will boom too.

The charcoal nubuck is cool and pretty casual as a service boot. You can rock it in a lot of different ways.\\n\\nThe Dundalk are not a dress boot by any means, but have a European influence to them and take some cues from cowboy boots. Its pointier toe box isn\\'t quite as casual, and their narrowness can make them feel dressier than they are.\\n\\nWith that said, here is my thoughts.\\n\\nWhy not get the riders, but in a different color? These colors may not pop up again, and this price is very good for Dundalks. They are pretty versatile, and I think olive or cognac would make for awesome boots to wear.\\n\\nDayton always has charcoal nubuck. It is a standard leather. They don\\'t have sales *all the time*, but they do have them. Since they use Shopify, you can get a coupon emailed to you if you leave the boots in your cart. 10 or 20%.\\n\\nThis deal is better than normal, but not by a *huge* amount (like the Rider Boots) and they have raised their prices for foreign customers, which stinks, But $70 is only a bit more than $54, and in Loonies probably only equals a few USD (maybe around $10USD).\\n\\nTL;DR: Consider the riders in a different color. This deal is amazing and the leathers are unique. The Daytons aren\\'t much cheaper than normal and the leather is a stock color., Stripe charges a nominal fee per transaction,  but there is no transactional fee with shopify. \\n\\nYou cant charge CCs without a payment processor and stripe is just one supported by Shopify. What did I misread? , You will pay a stripe fee and shopify charges a fee on top of that. \\n\\nI need a double confirmation from shopify if this is the case; but another guy I this thread said this is the case, Thanks for the well thought reply.  You\\'d be surprised but I actually came to the exact same conclusion a few hours ago, and it was nice for it to be reinforced.  I\\'m gonna get the olive dundalks, and pick up the daytons when the price is better.  Just trying to imagine the olives in my wardrobe/what color pants would go with them.  Also, how exactly does this shopify trick work?, Hopefully until old age. Probably will only last a month.

Im moving all my sites to shopify eventually. , You can get T-shirts from the ngng store (http://nogutsnogalaxy.myshopify.com/collections/t-shirts), they keep some in stock. All my t-shirts have been 1 off runs so unfortunately you can\\'t buy them because I don\\'t keep stock., &gt; it\\'s rarely about the product but about the solution to a person\\'s problem anyway\\n\\nThat\\'s a very good mindset, and it will work both in sales and marketing :D\\n\\n&gt; if I understand you correctly, sales is more one on one.\\n\\nTraditional (brick and mortar) sales is. Online, not so much.\\n\\nAnd not to say that marketing has no one-on-one sessions.. It does, because you\\'re still dealing with a lot of people (representing companies, mostly, but still).\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to start a business, interpreting data is a must, though :) You gotta know what people are doing, and you can\\'t do it one person at a time, you won\\'t have enough time for it. You\\'ll have to look at the data you have, process it into useful information (though most likely Shopify or other tools you use will do it for you) so you can get a good grip on what\\'s happening out there.\\n\\nI suggest lurking in /r/Entrepreneur if you haven\\'t already. There are some self-promotions, sure, but you can get a lot of insight there, too. \\n\\nI guess basically you will never get to do what you love to do and not do what you don\\'t like doing at all :) There must be compromises.. You just have to decide what\\'s worth the compromise.\\n\\nI guess :P, My two cents: \\n- you mention the word effortless seven times and effortlessly another time. That\\'s seven times too many. \\n- just because you can fit a website to the width of an iPhone doesn\\'t mean you should.  Why force the user to scroll down forever?  No one will do this. Ever.  You lost me. \\n- I can barely figure out what you are selling or offering as a product. You need a one sentence plug that tells people what you do and let them sign up (check out paypal.com on mobile)\\n- look at any other big player that takes mobile users seriously and see how they present a landing page for mobile OS\\'s (mint.com, Etc.)\\n- set one brand able domain name. You\\'ve got two which are singular/plural and also on two different extensions: www.beeswaxwebsites.com and beeswax.website \\n- splash page grammar is terrible: \"youwant a gorgeous website with no work\" and \"we got you covered\". You\\'ve just lost me. Again. \\n- example site has a menu link in the lower right hand corner of the screen.  That is very odd. \\n- ???? \"What’s the Catch? There is no catch!! (ok, there’s a tiny one)\" ???\\nWhy would you ever write that?  It makes no sense. And it is misleading confusing. \\n- \"You can’t sign up or build a BeesWax website on a mobile touch screen.\"\\nYou lost me a third time. Seriously.  Either recode things or quit while you\\'re ahead.  It\\'s \\'the rule\\' nowadays to let people create content from any device.  - why wouldn\\'t a customer just use http://www.weebly.com or any one of hundreds of other sites?\\n- how can users auto import from their etsy account?  Shopify does this already.  Do you include at least etsy mini?\\n- can customers use their own domain name?\\n- that\\'s a good start. , It\\'s late and I\\'m on a phone... But here goes.\\n\\nFirst rule of Etsy and selling anything online is to \"Make what people want.\"\\nAfter that: jewelry is a crowded market.  Flooded. And then some. And then some again.  It\\'s going to be hard to stand out.  The only way to do that is to list a million variations and increase your quantity of listings. I\\'ve found that volume and variety pay more that ads or social media plugs. Social media is fine, but it takes a long time to build the audience. So pick away at it slowly.   Also - some of your lighting is wonderful - jewelry on a bright white and well lit background makes me want to look closer.  Earrings on dimly lit mugs - not so much.  Not that it all needs to be on a white background - any bright color will do.  However, Amazon requires that my first image for all items is featured on a white background.  So there might be something there. And I would look into building a simple light box.  It will do wonders.  Shipping. I would seriously consider listing items as $19.97 with free shipping rather than $17.00 plus $3.00 shipping.   There are some good articles on Shopify\\'s website about the advantages of free shipping. You\\'re on to something and have nice stuff.  Good luck.

As far as concerns about Google\\'s mobilegeddon, the only place it affects is smartphone searches (not tablets, laptops, or desktops)http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2015/04/faqs-april-21st-mobile-friendly.html.\\n\\nIt it is fairly straightforward to manually create a mobile site or stylesheet if that\\'s an important feature to you (I just posted the example to show what an unedited site looks like)\\n\\nOur platform is actually shopping cart neutral, we just start with an Etsy cart because our software is meant to create a seamless transition from Etsy to Website.  We have a paypal and a shopify integration, and can accept other shopfronts as iframes.\\n\\nBig cartel is a nice platform, but you only get 25 items to sell for the 9.95 you mentioned, and after that the fees go up quite a bit.  Most of our seller on BeesWax have more than 25 items (some have many more).\\n\\nEdited to add:  While Big Cartel may not charge a transaction fee per se, they process all of their transactions through PayPal, which does charge a fee.  The PayPal-only thing, in itself, is somewhat limiting to what kind of customers you can reach.\\n\\nIn conclusion:  It\\'s very unusual to see any kind of e-commerce platform where you aren\\'t paying for a transaction, somehow, to someone.  I know a lot about e-commerce, and I honestly can\\'t think of any platforms that are completely flat-fee with no transaction charge.  I can only imagine that if such a thing existed, it would be pretty expensive (simply because merchant accounts cost money, and that money has to be recouped somewhere).  \\n, Oddly the more stuff I bought the less I tended to make per item because I wasn\\'t being as picky with my purchases. I spent around a grand per month on bulk electronics from police auction. Mostly propertyroom.com stuff as I lived close enough to pickup pallets of things in person rather than having them ship the stuff. Cost of items varied greatly but I was always rather picky when buying. My belief was you make the money buying, not selling, as I can dictate the buy price while the market dictates the sell. I would try and pay about 7% of the sale price for an item and my win percentage was less than 10% of the auctions I bid on. Cell phones made good money until one day I was watching a documentary on cell phones in prison only to slowly think \"ooohh nooo… the phones I\\'m selling have been up someones butt.\" and I quit doing that.\\n\\nThrift stores, there\\'s a Goodwill in Santa Ana I would go to, they specialized in electronics and I always made money off their audio equipment. Home theater amps they have for $20, pop it on eBay for $89 or so and it would sell usually across the country in about a day. For reasons I can\\'t figure out to this day they still seem to price stuff stupidly low, which is out of the norm for Goodwill, picked up a pair of Bose 901\\'s there with the equalizer for $60. They do have two daily auctions there though, so I imagine the electronics store might be a last ditch effort to get rid of the stuff quick.\\n\\nYup, definitely a grind. I hated the receptiveness, the weeks where people don\\'t buy could be predicted though. Usually it was the same schedule every year. Around tax time you\\'ll make buckets of cash while thanksgiving to new year if you sold used stuff like I did, might as well just take a month long vacation. No one buys used stuff for gifts. Right now it\\'s kind of a toss, I would get lots of offers on things during the summer for some reason and sales will tank for a couple weeks when back to school season starts.\\n\\nIf you want to make your life easier, assuming you aren\\'t already doing this with 400 listings over various sites, I\\'d recommend looking into either a Shopify store or WooCommerce ontop of WordPress. I never got many sales off my own website but it let me make a listing on my website and it would automatically go to eBay and Amazon. Say if something sold on eBay, it took the listing off Amazon and my website. I did a 10% discount on my website, the software added 10% to eBay/Amazon listings to cover the fees. For me Etsy wasn\\'t worth the time, Craigslist could do very well but 90% would only do local pickup so you\\'ll have to be setup for that. As a bonus your website keeps track of analytics so you can bring up charts for sales per week and do things like auto generate an estimate of sales once you have a full year or more of data. Gives you a bit more consistency or you can do category reports which can show that say audio equipment sells well but you aren\\'t doing too hot with printers., Easily the dreadnaut mech mod, hands down.\\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0602/0841/products/dred01_1024x1024.jpg?v=1409791702\\nits the ugliest thing i have ever seen in general.\\nrunner up would be itaste 134 http://tasteyourjuice.com/wordpress/wp-content/flagallery/itaste134/img_6336.jpg, I you want an urban biking to the office look you could check out.

We have a paypal and a shopify integration, and can accept other shopfronts as iframes.\\n\" Except your FAQ\\'s state that you have to have an etsy shop in order to use your site.\\n\\nAfter doing a little more thinking I think you are competing with cartel, because it doesn\\'t look like you offer any type of shopping cart, rather you are redirecting to etsy for sales. Which, anyone can do by redirecting their own URL for free ( or they could use a free wordpress template and have a home page for themselves where their \"shop\" button can redirect to etsy. Which is why i just don\\'t see why someone would pay $12 a month to you for this service when there are free options out there (what is your value add???)\\n\\n- Heck Square space has built in ecommerce - for $8 a month so it seems you would be competing with them ( and they already have you beat with templates to choose from, most of which are mobile friendly, and they have built in ecommerce.\\n\\nAnd I think you may have misunderstood my point about etsy\\'s 3.5% fee. Which was - why spend money on your own domain, to gain traffic to your own domain.. to then push the sale to happen on etsy. The point of having your own site with ecommerce is to push traffic there, so you are not paying anyone else ( etsy in this case) extra commission for your sale. ( in this case an extra 3.5%) Yes there are credit card processing fees for sales ( paypal/ stripe / shopifypayments/ whoever you want to use) but on your own ecommerce site there is not an extra 3.5% that you are handing over to a third party ( like etsy). I have used big cartel ( i am currently using shopify) and I drove traffic there to keep more of my profit, and keep people in my store - not to send them back to etsy to loose more profit and have them easily leave to the next shop.\\n\\nWhile I am not knocking your years worth of work... I am asking what your value add is? Why would someone choose you over options already out there that have already proven themselves? What makes you better?, what color suit or tux? something interesting could be a navy tie with a yellow/orange [paisley](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0109/6372/products/Pocket_Square_10_1024x1024.jpeg) or [floral](https://img0.etsystatic.com/049/1/5736322/il_570xN.670380184_t19m.jpg) pocket square. , Fair enough, I\\'m happy to answer regarding our value proposition.  \\n\\nWhen looking at website solutions for Etsy (which many people want or need), I feel strongly that there is a gap in the market, first where ease of use is concerned, and second where scalability is concerned.  \\n\\nShopify and squarespace are both fine platforms, but you are likely to pay as much, if not much more (shopify especially) in overall fees per month when transactions are included, over an Etsy + Website Hosting solution, which is what we offer.\\n\\nWordpress templates are less stable because they lack vertical integration and plugins can cause unforeseen conflicts (even for professional developers, let alone novices who just want a nice website). And even then, if you want your own URL, you will have to accept a hosting fee, or some kind of spammy advertising arrangement.  \\n\\nAnd none of these are designed specifically to make Etsy sellers as productive as possible, as quickly as possible. While it\\'s possible to integrate Etsy with Squarespace, it\\'s far from a seamless solution.  They recommend Etsy Mini, but the number of items it displays is limited.  It also lacks social media features on a per-item basis.\\n\\nOther options (Squarespace ecommerce) allow more items for sale, but they require that all of the items be re-uploaded, you have to pay Square transaction fees, and then you have 2 lines of inventory to control.  This may be an acceptable solution for some people, but I consider it to be sub-optimal.  \\n\\nBeesWax offers a cost-competitive solution for people who wish to maintain their Etsy platform while building brand equity online.  Since we\\'re platform neutral, there is no requirement to stay with Etsy (although I expect most people will choose to do so unless Etsy increases its commission take rate in the wake of its IPO).   \\n\\nThe overall reason to push traffic to your own domain, of course, is to build Google authority and brand equity over time.  This can happen in a variety of ways and on a number of platforms, but I believe that based on the points listed above, the BeesWax solution is the most seamless, effortless, and cost effective.    , Sf Chronicle store:\\nhttp://sfchronicle.myshopify.com/collections/newspapers, Artist\\'s website: http://brandonbird.myshopify.com/, printful API but you need to host it somewhere for example: woocommerce, shopify, bigcommerce, etc., There\\'s an app, \"Advanced Shipping Manager\", for $70 a month.

How long would it take you to put together the reports shopify provides you with this plan? At a minimum it\\'s going to take a few hours.

Switching to shopify afterwards is easy and wont eat much.\\n\\nI am using shopify as my initial due to problems with Cartel\\'s cart clearance page, but I am paying the price, especially when the business is in the starting process. , But apart from the fees, will I get more exposure by using Shopify?

Ans how is FBA related to Shopify?\\n, I don\\'t know much about using Wix but I can tell you that being \"easy to use\", along with great support, and most importantly a great app marketplace, is well worth the $79/mo I pay for Shopify. With that said, the decision should be based on the budget for your store. I have one store that only does $2k/mo in sales so I use the $29/mo plan there.

Do not get it from the place where you get hosting due to the hoster being able to hold it hostage if you violate some obscure ToS thing.\\n\\nFor hosting you will probably start off with shared hosting.  Side bar hosts are one option and http://www.webhostingtalk.com is another to find reviews + discounts on others.  I don\\'t have any recommendations for shared hosting.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t know anything such as ecommerce setup you would probably benefit from going with a provider like Shopify where they handle all the hosting and also ecommerce setup.  Pretty much everything is handled by them.  You however do pay a premium.  If you decide to get hosting yourself though, please do not use Magento even though everyone says to.  It\\'s insanely complex and you\\'ll quickly dig yourself a grave., I know nothing about ecommerce setup!

Little fees here and there are adding up! I appreciate your honesty, I guess I am thinking too small, I should probably try to hit the market as strong as I can instead of tip toeing around :P Thanks!, Etsy TOS prevents the transfer of an Etsy account to another user, but there\\'s nothing to prevent the sale of all assets (except the username/login) of an LLC to another person.  You\\'d probably have to transfer the assets to another, more permissive, ecommerce platform such as shopify, ebay, Big Commerce, Magento, something like that, so the brand equity that was created on Etsy would not be relevant to the terms of sale.  , always loved shopify\\'s site, Well, her endocrinologist seemed to back that [Salazar gave her Cytomel legit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0248/8471/files/Exhibit_21.pdf?10179272499514451932)... and [for Rupp as well](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0248/8471/files/Exhibit_22.pdf?10179272499514451932). If she never broke doping rules but can only allege that others did, what is she so fearful of?, Do a shopify trial?, It looks like the Shopify back end, though it\\'s impossible to tell from just a screen shot. , It does raise the question of how much profit you expect to make if you\\'re not willing to pay even $14 a month for Shopify.\\n\\nHow is OP going to do advertising for free?, [1](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0275/9117/products/GENTRY-NYC-CAMOSHITA-POPLIN-LONG-SHIRT-NAVY-17440_1024x1024.jpg?v=1429537927)\\n\\n[2](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0275/9117/products/GENTRY-NYC-CAMOSHITA-DOUBLE-BREASTED-JACKET-NAVY-COTTON-LINEN-17331_1024x1024.jpg?v=1429537774)\\n\\n[3](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0275/9117/products/GENTRY-NYC-JUNYA-WATANABE-COMME-DES-GARSONS-WOOL-PINSTRIPE-BLAZER-NAVY-5523_1024x1024.jpg?v=1425519822)\\n\\n[Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4UckOGdZtI), I\\'ve helped many clients get started and try this stuff. I look at T-Shirt businesses with 2 primary models:\\n\\n1. Low risk, zero-to-low upfront investment, low margins.\\n2. Higher risk, large upfront investment, higher margins.\\n\\nFor you, I would suggest Option 1. And as a web designer/developer I would do it using Shopify.com, linked up with Printful (the supplier), and tied into Stripe or Shopify Payments as the payment processor.\\n\\nThis would end up costing you almost nothing up front to build the entire website (using a Shopify template). In fact, if you have the time, you could probably build it during the Shopify trial period. Printful is on-demand. Stripe/Shopify Payments\\' fees are transaction-based.\\n\\nThis will get you a product line with low margins unfortunately, but it\\'s a way to at least get the business\\' logistics working., I have a similar (not t-shirt but other similar consumer goods) start up and the biggest issue I have had to date is monetizing the traffic I\\'ve been getting.\\n\\nHave paid for some facebook ads and have gotten what I feel like is a good amount of traffic from it (200+ likes on fb and over 400 unique visits to my site from facebook clicks) but have not monetized much of the traffic. 2+ weeks in and have only sold about 80 units. \\n\\nTwitter is the same deal, I\\'ve been following people that I think would want my product, have gotten a couple hundred people follow me back and have DM\\'d them special coupon codes to use, so far no one has used any of the coupons, and I\\'m not sure if I have gotten any actual sales off of twitter referals. \\n\\nI use Shopify to host my site and have found it extremely easy to use, change things on and create coupon codes. They also show you exactly where all your traffic is originating from which can help show where to focus attention. , If you\\'re really set on bright red, there are [better](http://prepsterpunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Balenciaga-Red-Sneakers.jpg) [looking](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0049/9112/products/adidas-x-raf-simons-stan-smith-_red_1024x1024.jpg?v=1432217319) [options](http://theshoegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ronnie-fieg-filling-pieces-rf-mid-red.jpg) out there., It\\'s not Wordpress but Shopify has a ton of plugins that allow for product customizations. , Received [Pabst Blue Ribbon lip balm](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0268/4015/products/021154_grande_n_large.jpg?v=1408102734).  It\\'s a thing, and your lips can smell like PBR all day long (jk, its unscented), So im playing around with Shopify and what i want to do with t shirts is more custom t shirts. Whatever they need and it looks like they want me to upload premade shirts on here so i don\\'t think this will work., I\\'ll give them a call today and see if we can get a further discount on volume pricing. I don\\'t have a fancy shopify thing like pete or josh, but PM me how many you want. I know I\\'m going to buy a box and I can at least split off 3 for you., This reminds me of an awesome card by Emily McDowell (https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0527/2397/products/196-m-strangers-on-internet-print-8-x-10_1024x1024.jpg?v=1428709922).\\n\\nListen, totally normal to feel this way.  I do too, sometimes.  I love the nurseries on pinterest and feel terrible that my daughter\\'s room is not at all decorated.  But in the end...  she doesn\\'t care!  She gets my attention instead of me spending it on trying to make things look perfect!  She has baskets of toys and books and parents who love her.  And BTW, scrambled eggs and fruit is a great breakfast!  You aren\\'t falling short.  You are a normal mama.  , The main difference as stated is that Wix isn\\'t an E-Commerce platform like Shopify is. Plus we have some kick ass customer service! :) , Both Rivals fly like all other Rivals I\\'ve seen. The Icon Rival being slightly flatter than the Pinnacle and a bit more grippy. The Pink Outlaw is in Pinnacle plastic and is part of a limited run of 400. As far as I know there have only been 2 runs of Pinnacle Outlaws (Blue PDGA submission and the Pink TRs) making this disc pretty rare. Looks like the one below but has a green shatter stamp instead. \\n\\nhttp://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0202/1014/products/IMG_1941_large.JPG?v=1417072279, Yea, but keep in mind that when you say \"fees\", the fees are only incurred on a transaction, so you pay the fees with the revenue.\\n\\nShopify is a web service and will cost you monthly, regardless.\\nPrintful is an on-demand service that only charges you a transaction fee on sale. This is great because you only pay Printful if you SELL.\\nStripe and Shopify Payments (Shopify-branded Stripe) is a merchant/payment processor that only charges per transaction as well.\\n\\nUsing Shopify linked up to Printful and Stripe will only cost the monthly Shopify fee. Everything else is charged on a sale. It\\'s a great system for starting out., Shopify is min $29/mo. If you use Shopify\\'s Payment Processor (Shopify Payments), it a 2.9% + .30 cents transaction fee on sale.\\n\\nPrintful is priced per product. You pick your products. https://www.theprintful.com/product/t-shirts\\n\\nExample: A Printful product might cost $15. You price it at $20 in your store. Customer purchases it. When the money hits your bank account in 2 days the Stripe/Shopify Payments fee is already stripped out. You\\'ll see $19.12 in your bank. ($20 - $.88). Then you\\'ll have a balance of $15 on your Printful account to pay.\\n\\nAfter Printful charges you. Your left over profit is $4.12.\\n\\nThese numbers probably aren\\'t totally accurate but hopefully that gives a good example of how this works. This type of system was unheard of years ago. This is the way to do it now until you have a customer base or large amount of sales., From [KNITorious Fabric](http://knitorious-fabric.myshopify.com/)!  Unfortunately this print looks to be sold out and they seem to move through prints pretty quickly.  Luckily they update a lot with new stuff.  The prices are steep, but this fabric was definitely high quality.\\n, I like Shopify for ease of use and ease of getting a basic site up and running.\\n\\nIf you need more complexity they have an app store to add functionality to it, but many of those apps will cost you either a single charge or a monthly charge... though if you are up to it you can write a private app to do stuff as well.\\n\\nEdit:  also, they certify that they are PCI-DSS compliant already, so no need for extra compliance scans., First, don\\'t get me wrong - I HIGHLY encourage you to continue what you\\'re doing.  You\\'re on the right path and you should pat yourself on the back as you continue to stick with it.  As far as a routine/program, start with something more practical and quit winging it.  Noobie gains are awesome, so embrace them.  Start here:   \\n[Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:Introduction)  \\n[Strong Lifts](http://stronglifts.com/)  \\n[Greyskull LP](http://strengthvillain.myshopify.com/products/the-greyskull-lp-second-edition)  \\n[Average F\\'n](http://ironstrong.org/index.php?/topic/1157-the-average-fn-program-a-simple-and-efficient-training-template/)\\n  \\nKeep in mind what you outlined is not necessarily a strength program, but more hypertrophy.  If your goal is truly strength like you said, then you cannot go wrong with any of the 4 above.  I\\'d succest you go with SS., What merch was produced, was mainly released in promotional ways and can\\'t be bought.\\n\\nI am very lucky as I was given [this](http://brickstorms.com/blogs/how-to/8769735-build-your-own-infantile-cloud-custom-model-from-guild-wars-2-super-adventure-box) awesome little lego set. Is your wife a fan of the Super Adventure Box? *If so* - you would be able to put together a set like this yourself, as the instructions [are available online](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0177/8572/files/InfantileCloudKitInstructions.pdf?602) (just buy the required bricks individually from the lego online store).\\n\\n, One way to do this is to use ecommerce platform like shopify or magento, this way you can keep track of orders and invoices from there, We\\'re using Kickofflabs for our pre-launch page and Shopify for our e-Comm. Without doing any significant development work, we\\'re at the mercy of Kickofflab\\'s templates. I\\'ll see if I can work in more information.\\n\\nWe\\'re sourcing in Ningbo, China and textile from Japan and China., Thanks :)\\n\\nI started with phone case printing to learn about e-Commerce. That project cost me about $1,000 to kickoff and had great returns.\\n\\nCheck this out if you haven\\'t already: \\n\\nhttp://www.shopify.com/blog/34526469-how-we-built-an-ecommerce-business-from-scratch-and-generated-922-16-in-revenue-in-3-days\\n\\nThey invested $500 capital and kicked off an e-Commerce business within 3 days., Very cool. \\n\\nShopify is a great company. They are staying innovative. \\n\\nGood luck! , Could you maybe make a bangle like thing? Instead of a chain, a solid piece of metal threaded into slots on either side of the coin? [Something like this?](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0212/3150/products/IMG_4880.jpg?v=1409768929) That way the coin won\\'t flip around and will stay engraved side up. , Well, I wouldn\\'t sweat it with the Ortliebs - they\\'re a little overpriced but they get the job done really well. They\\'re very similar to the Vaudes, really. \\n\\nAs for the Hyalites in your link - I know nothing about them. They look a little frail in the images - but that\\'s just guessing - really. Their city bike pannier looks the business, but again, I don\\'t know them. Might be worth a try.\\n\\nIf you want something durable and unique, check out [BlackStar](http://black-star-bags.myshopify.com/collections/panniers/products/brown-and-light-brown-panniers) from Portland, Good point on the molds... I had in my head that they would only need to adjust the one part, but these days that requires an entire mold redesign.\\n\\nMy understanding of the UCI regulation (that I am thinking of, perhaps there are others that I\\'m missing) is that the product has to be available for sale.  They can\\'t sell the bike without those openings in the US per laws, but that doesn\\'t mean they can\\'t have it available for sale other places without said law.  The item just needs to be available for someone: example, [Adam Hansen\\'s custom shoes](http://hanseeno.myshopify.com/collections/shoes) are *technically* available, but the odds of anyone apart from him getting them are slim.\\n\\nReviewing the rules uses the wordage \"anyone.\" So I guess that argument hinges on the UCI\\'s definition of \"anyone.\"'"
