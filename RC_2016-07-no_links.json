I spent some time researching webgility but what ultimately stopped me from going that route was that there were a few users who complained of a problem I've already experienced; webgility does not accurately reconcile net profit minus Shopify fees  when importing to quickbooks. Because my Shopify store does a decent sales volume per month I don't have enough time to go in and reconcile each transaction, so I already have another app that does this for me automatically. I didn't want to make it more convoluted by tying in a third app to my Shopify store and then throwing this unrelated FBA venture into the mix.\n\nI would love to do stitch labs but right now their cost to combine my two separate ventures (Shopify site + this FBA venture) would be the $500/mo plan. Although it would make it more convenient the route I ended up taking for FBA + my existing shopify is right at $200/mo, and I don't need some of the features stitch labs touts for that $500/mo plan just yet.

For future reference it looks like Shopify is planning on introducing an [FBA tie-in app]---LINK--- at some point; this would have likely solved my problem but it's not out at this time and there's no projected release date that I was able to find.\n\nWhat I ended up doing was going the InventoryLab route for two reasons; 1) it will help me get familiar with all of the intricacies of this process, and 2) it gave me access to the Scoutify app, which I like thus far (although I will be testing JungleScout and possibly some others). I ended up creating a \"class\" in quickbooks online to classify my FBA business separate from my Shopify one and I will end up manually importing the basic numbers I need for tax purposes (e.g. expenses, COGS, etc.) at regular intervals. I haven't quite yet wrapped my head around sales tax reporting but thus far IL's user guide has been great and I'm sure I'll have it down in no time.\n\nI appreciate all of the information in thus sub so even if you didn't reply, I would like to sincerely thank you all for your contributions to this community.

However, there's plenty of roads and utility lines that could easily run Telecom cable through as there plenty of access. When will Canada provide decent Telecom so that people in remote areas can tap into the marketplace that is the World Wide Web? \n\nAfter my contract is done in August, I'm starting a business in Ottawa where I require about $20,000 in equipment and software licensing to even start operating and that's after my Masters degree (supported by government subsidies) and my co founders (Bsc, BA and college diploma). In total, we have 20 years (combined) of higher education and are willing to apply our highly developed skillsets (10 years combined working in this field) to this business. \n\nWhere can we get any investors as we don't have capital or collateral to fund ourselves? I kinda feel overwhelmed and do not feel that I am supported by my government at the municipal provincial or federal level. We are three highly educated bilingual Canadians (M.Sc., B.Sc. B.Sc. B.A.(McGill, Ottawa, Ottawa, Ottawa)) but do not have the slightest clue how to operate our knowledge into the marketplace. This is the problem we are facing. 1) We need capital to buy the equipment/licenses to compete with existing companies. 2) We need to effectively advertise our skillsets to a very conservative marketplace that is very unfriendly to untried companies. 3) We need enough money to get by and live without parental support (basically $2,000/month covers living costs in Ottawa). \n\nOttawa feels like a failed marketplace as everyone invested in .com businesses and got burned by Nortel and co and lacks entrepreneurial spirit. The reason why success stories like Shopify take off is that they require low levels of investment capital whereas people who want to get into specialized equipment and software for their specific areas of expertise face enormous hurdles despite a huge investment by the federal government on education to be able use those tools effectively.

{"body": "Hey there, thanks so much for responding. I'll try to answer each paragraph as succinct as I can. \n\nI definitely agree that having products physically there is the best thing to do. In terms of price because of quality and fees, prices will be fairly lower because I actually supply the furniture manufacturer with lumber, and I can provide him lower prices in that which could lower expense of the furniture exponentially. \n\nMy guess with refunds is to charge a % of the total furniture if they decide to return in for reasons other than damages caused by the shipper (which we will have insurance for). When you say to get together a selection process, do you mean creating a product catalogue (brochure, website, Instagram) categorized by dining tables and chairs, doors, mirrors, etc?\n\nThank you for your feedback on our quality. It is something I am always worried about, doubting it all the time. For photographs, I will hire a professional photographer to show great details of the furniture which we will use on a shopify website as well as printed out on brochures to hand out to furniture stores and other potential buyers. \n\nPrimary concerns: in terms of cost of materials, we get our good quality lumber for cheap, and can supply the lumber to him for cheap. The manufacturer says he will deal with all things logistics and shipping, and I trust him because he has been with us for 20 years. My biggest worry is storing our products in the USA. Unless we sell directly to retailers and distributors, we have no way of storing the furniture without spending a lot of money. \n\nWe will build a shopify website that will cleanly show all products, as well as possibly taking custom orders. \n\nAs for the target market: do you think we should just hit any furniture stores? And should I base my prices off competitors? Of course prices will be lower to stay competitive and to incentivize buyers. \n\nThank you for your time, hope to hear back!", "id": "d4zvj5z", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1467719696, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4rbi20", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "FriendlyLovers", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1471214493, "parent_id": "t1_d4zsua7"}

{"id": "d5041tq", "body": "I'd agree, but then this would also have to apply to any marketplace, not just the ones that are socially irresponsible or unethical. \n\n[The slippery slope on this topic is vast]---LINK--- \n\ni.e. LVMH, who make handbags and perfume, [sued eBay]---LINK--- for selling counterfeit goods, and managed to block all sales of counterfeit, as well as legitimate products, much as TinyBuild wants to do. [VeRO]---LINK---, allows official distributors to block sales of products on eBay. Nothing like this exists on any reseller outside of eBay and Amazon though.\n\nVeRO, is also enabled by trade agreement legislation like the DMCA, which allows \"Safe harbor\" provisions for marketplaces, and allows for markets to not be held liable as long as they comply with a takedown notice. Again, nothing like this exists, and perhaps the argument should be to bring the DMCA to G2A and other foreign countries hosting websites. \n\nBut that's a strongly antithetical argument to present, i.e. applying US standards via Free Trade Agreement laws, Practices and Intellectual Property Rights, Copyright and infringement policy to apply globally, sic. That's kind of what's already happening via the DMCA, and IP laws, but it takes years, decades. And everyone has to agree on what constitutes \"safe harbor\".  \n\nE.g. craigslist, eBay, amazon, Alibaba, sellfy, etsy, gumtree, shopify, wordpress, paypal and any credit card payment gateway, credit card merchant service and fraud prevention service in entirety accept and deal with fraud on a regular basis.\n\nAnd arguably they even tacitly allow and profit from fraud, even when it costs them directly. There are no exceptions, because inherent in the process is that the merchant that takes commission or royalties or fees for the sale is profiting from theft, i.e. fencing goods. It might be 1% or 5% or 0.1%, but it's still profit. And, there's every exception for the times that sellers aren't caught, or it's too difficult for the credit card providers to prosecute, etc.\n\nG2A, accepts fraud because it doesn't care. It makes money, it's one of many other companies that do this, and they justify all kinds of shoddy practises. As do other merchants and marketplaces.\n\nG2A just makes it more obvious due to the G2A Shield \"protection\" they charge buyers, that other sites fold into their costs or charge the sellers instead. \n\nG2A Shield is dubious as all fuck, until you look at the other cdkey resellers and how they get traffic, and how their networks operate.

{"body": "If I had to guess, I'd imagine the conversion problem comes from people ordering custom products. Check the abandoned carts, if most are custom then the problem is there's no obvious way for me to send you files. I can complete the entire checkout process on Shopify and there's no way to upload a file until, presumably, at the end you give me an email address or something? Put in the description an explanation of how they need to send files in, or better yet if you want to do custom like this then you should use another cart that supports uploads with orders.\n\nI would also check Shopify for where in the checkout process these people left. Did they just add to cart? Because they might come back when they get paid to buy something, or did they abandon the cart at say the checkout phase? If your margins support it, I'd move to free shipping for everything all the time. \n\nMake it as simple as possible on the customer so you remove [the customers] barriers to entry. People in business like to talk about barriers to entry on the business side but often they forget this goes both ways. A buyer coming to your site also has barriers that must be crossed before they purchase. They have to decide on a product, they have to figure out if they agree with your price, in your case they need to upload a photo. You got to make this simple for the customer, removing the most barriers so they purchase.\n\nEdit: Reading the FAQ, all the way on the last question, gave me a hint to your process. Though it was a confusing read because the first few sentences indicate I can customize by choosing a face or adding text. I'm thinking in my mind at this point \"WTF? So I can't upload a photo at all? I can only choose a face or add text?\" but continuing to read it says I can send a photo after checkout. That's your problem IMO, I went blind on your site and didn't even notice the FAQ button until I finished this post and went back for a deeper look.

{"body": "Hey - founder of Zoey here and was literally browsing the front page when this popped up. In any case, I'm sorry to hear about the problems you've had. To answer some of the specific points you've brought up:\n\n1. Our Design Editor is an ever evolving tool and something that no other eCommerce platform provides today. We made decisions early on as to whether to allow full code access or focus more on the WYSIWYG aspect; we chose the latter. That doesn't mean we'll be shying away from code just that we haven't built everything to support that yet. Some of the items you've pointed out are certainly flaws, some are things we need to do better, some may be usability issues and in most cases we are already aware of these items and plan on improving them in the near future. Nevertheless, our customers manage to build beautiful websites and as a team we believe that what we've build is an incredible foundation to grow from and the improvements from here are quick and often with updates on a weekly basis. \n\n2. Our UI was designed in house and was not meant to be a rip off of any platform nor do I think it is. At the end of the day there are certain styles for web applications and whether they be Magento 2, Shopify, BigCommerce or even WordPress, they all tend to look the same. With respect to the inconsistencies in the UI, we started from the Magento Community 1.9 baseline which is an extremely clunky and outdated interface containing over 100 individual screens that had to be refactored. Instead of tweaking the UI so that buttons match we are taking a much deeper approach by rebuilding entire sections of the application so that they are more powerful, easier to use, more consistent and merchant focused. This is a time consuming process for our team and we have to balance this approach.\n\n3. We're currently building the foundation for developers to build on the platform. The ability to create your own themes and publish them on our platform is coming. The ability to create your own third party modules and publish them on our platform is coming. This is another pillar of development that we are currently tackling and most of what you see is us developing on the tools that we're building. I agree with you that polish and consistency is needed and I can also tell you that we are working towards that every day.\n\n4. Having personally read through a lot of the reviews I think that most of them acknowledge the fact that we are an up and coming platform with a lot to offer but roughness around the edges. I don't think every review is 5 stars or 10/10 (nor do I think that would be a productive review). I can send you some reviews that are less than stellar but they are our motivation to continue to build and improve. We've seen tremendous growth this year because we are truly building a platform that brings Enterprise eCommerce power to everyone and not just those with large development budgets.\n\nI appreciate the time you've taken to make this post. I hope my reply helps in some ways. Regardless, I can promise you that the team and I are extremely committed to the success of Zoey. While we are certainly not perfect with valuable feedback such as yours we can continue to improve the platform. \n\nPerhaps we can setup a time to chat in further detail? \n\nThanks,\n\nUri\n\nPS: Undo in the design editor has been something that I've wanted to see since day 1.

{"body": "I like your product. It first glance it is eye catching, quirky and unique. I can really only help on questions 3 and 4. \n\n3) The site is not bad. Better than most, but a lot could be done. I don't know how much control you have over a shopify template. I'd try to simplify it as much as possible to draw people towards the product images.

Don't assume they will click the image. Check out ---LINK--- for a proper reply.\n\n4) In my experience, you need the audience first before you do the kickstarter. Especially for a product like this. No use trying to get support from non-existent followers. I'd concentrate on building a following on instagram / facebook / twitter.

Have you got a large audience you are travelling to that can only be reached (or reached much more easily) in person? You have a product that ships cheap. Embrace that. \n\nLastly, I see you just use random pages from the dictionary (on at least one print). Perhaps have a look for pages that contain relevant words to the print. I'm sure you could find 15-20 separate pages for each design (\"west\", \"coast\", \"canada\", etc).

{"body": "Thank you so much for posting your review of the Zoey ecommerce Platform! All of the items noted in your review have been witnessed by us as users of the system.  We moved over to Zoey from Shopify. While Shopify has many of its own challenges, platform stability was not one experienced by us.  In our experience the Zoey system as it was without the design tool was at least was reliable.  The biggest issues we face today is never knowing how an update will adversely affect our store.  Having had experience working with software development and quality control I often wonder if their test environment is fundamentally different than production. \nWith the most recent update we lost a day of our resources trying to figure out what to do with changes that were made to our site as a result of Zoey flipping the switch and dealing with a significantly revised UI that occurred nearly in the middle of a work day.  In addition to the issues you cited one of the big challenges we face is the lack of apps that are key to ecommerce now such as customer reward programs and etc.  We find when we talk to app companies they tell us there is no desire on their part to make their app available to Zoey users.  So as a user we are stuck between a rock and a hard place.  Do we continue to deal with platform uncertainty and lack of tools for our business? Believe me I understand the complexities of being an entrepreneur and an innovation company and we were accepting of the risks for the innovation we thought Zoey would bring. We wanted so badly to love Zoey. Unfortunately, our resources and patience are now waning and the cost of a platform move is now front and center in our thinking.  The setback to our business will be formidable with either decision.

There was a bug that we could not have foreseen where when we imported your categories a value was set to \"NULL\" instead of \"FALSE\". This value did not matter much except since we replaced Magento's default category structure with our own built in one \"NULL\" defaulted to \"TRUE\". This was an edge case and affected maybe a handful of people. There was another edge case where customers who migrated from Magento to Zoey using our migration tool and had multiple root categories might have had the wrong one selected. We do our best to QA things but these are sometimes problems that no test case can predict. I apologize you were affected by it.\n\n2.

I have in my Inbox about 60 partners that are waiting for this release ready to go - so I'm not sure what you mean by no desire.

My background is in domains, it is something I am very knowledgable about and I would be more than happy to help anyone looking for advice, as would most members.

{"body": "Sorry should have elaborated better - what you want to avoid is just selling \"hosting\". If you're selling plain old web hosting (or even a slightly more exciting but lower margin variety like VPS'es), then you're really competing with major companies like EIG who can pay $300 per customer marketing bounties while still charging sub-$2/mo pricing. You'll never be able to compete and survive. Basically the market for \"web hosting\" is over saturated to the point where it's nearly impossible to break into it.\n\nSo the better thing to do would be to think of a service that isn't sold as \"web hosting\", but something that is built on top of web hosting to make it more sticky, and to better dissociate yourself with regular old web hosts.\n\nShopify charges $50/mo for something that you could do for $0.99/mo + a free shopping cart software. If Shopify started as a web hosting company, they wouldn't be here today - but they took something that is (at it's core level) really just \"web hosting\" plus a little software, and in doing so, they are able to sell for 50x price that consumers would normally perceive as \"a good price\".\n\nObviously building a bespoke shopping cart software is out of the question, so try to think of something else that you can run on your own \"servers\" and thus charge a monthly fee for, but that isn't so broad as \"web hosting\" to make customers think to themselves, \"hmm, I can just do this with GoDaddy\".\n\nThe same goes for Wix, Weebly, Squarespace - they are really nothing more than site builders that web hosts have been bundling with web hosting for nearly 2 decades. But they differentiate themselves and don't really focus on being a web host - instead they position their product as a \"marketing tool\", with social integration and mobile and all that other crap. Thus, they avoid the curse of web hosting and can charge much higher prices than a web host who included a free sitebuilder, even if that sitebuilder product had all of the same features that Wix offers.\n\nSo try to think of something you can build / buy / license / get an outsourcer to make that services a niche or corner of a market you are familiar with. In your business model, you'll likely be hosting that service/software for your customers on your servers - but don't sell yourself as a webhost.\n\nGood luck!", "id": "d56xcha", "subreddit": "smallbusiness", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qr34", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1468176704, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4s6gql", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "ups": 2, "author": "jasongill", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1471336516, "parent_id": "t1_d56wuxk"}

It's great value for the infrastructure. What I'm proposing is a little different. I want it to be easy for people to sell online and market their products.\nOne half of our product is an in-house social media platform. We build a lot of real time and distribution infrastructure (sort of like twitter). The other half is a marketplace (like ebay) so you can have your own storefront here. The two are optimized for selling, communication and marketing. We integrated with other social media as well, again for distribution. Pintrest and twitter has the buy button, an ecommerce component but at the core, it\u2019s not really made for selling. And it\u2019s a little tricky for most people to get started with those, haha even for a web developer. \nFor us, a minute to sign up and a few minutes to list your product. Now, you still have to work hard to get yourself a following but we provide tools to get you going. Best of all, no overhead cost. And if you want to promote your independent website, we made spaces for that as well. \nTo conclude, I see our site as another channel for selling. You can sell on your site, sell on amazon, sell on ebay, and also sell on our site. Promote it everywhere. The more the merrier. All the rhetoric aside, I hope to build a platform that is useful for people and encompass more tools for businesses.

Find the ones who are successful, such as ---LINK--- and mimic them.  They have a successful model so follow it.  Your success is personal to me.  I started to build a beard oil site for my first online business.  I currently have hundreds of oil bottles with fancy packaging and lots of essential oils.  I unknowingly jumped into ecommerce and didn't think about keeping inventory and making a trip to the post office for a $5.00 profit.  I ultimately decided it wasn't for me.  I'm considering to try and sell them all on Amazon - both bulk supplies and individual bottles.  If you are interested in buying them from me just send me a message.\n\nAbout your site: I would get a model or you should grow a beard yourself and show us how to grow a great beard. Make the site personal with actual people.  It will make the site more legit.  The site just needs more info and pics.  Make a blog.  Make a gif to apply the oil or how to trim a beard.  Be creative.  Like I said earlier, follow a recipe that works, such as beardbrand.com but just as important, look for something they don't offer.  Look for what they are missing and try to implement that to your store.  Also, beardbrand was on shopify podcast and shark tank.  I would check it out.\n\n I would also contact every local barber shop and leave them a card.\n\nAnyway,  my last failure was a political t-shirt site.  After 1,000 visitors and no purchases I gave up. I'm currently working on my third site and I have more confidence than ever.  Its an outdoor website aiming towards a certain type of gear.  I don't know if it will work but I sure as hell know what wont work - which is a lack of interest.  I simply wasn't motivated enough for the first two sites because I have love/hate relationships with my beards and I'm not political enough to blog about it while trying to sell humorous shirts.  I love the outdoors and the gear I use for it.\n\nGood Luck man.

{"id": "d59mvpj", "body": "Registering as a business protects you. If your shirts kill someone and you don't have a business entity selling it, you are PERSONALLY liable. Or more appropriately, if some sues you for copyright infringement or something more appropriate for the apparel industry, then you'd be personally liable if you didn't have a business. This means they literally take the shirt off your back. ;)\n\nMy recommendation, if you're starting a business, registering a LLC is part of the operating cost. You can also register a business, and then sell all kinds of things from it. T-shirt company doesn't work out? Start selling soap through the company. It's an entity you can use indefinitely for a private business. \n\nI personally have used ---LINK--- to register all my companies. It's extremely easy, they basically walk you through it all, help you to get the EIN number with the IRS so you can open a business bank account, and give you reminders about filing deadlines. There are plenty of other companies out there that do this -- legalZoom is another popular one. \n\nFor tax questions, i'd probably do a bit of research. If you register a company in MA, then you have to pay state taxes. If you register in Deleware, Texas, Florida, etc, there are different laws and less taxes. It may cost more to initially register, but you'll potentially save money in the long run if you think you'll be generating a lot of income. This is where my expertise is limited. I'd probably try to ask a lawyer in MA or do research about MA residents registering corporations in other states. Someone in your State government, some tax office or something, may be able to help. They generally are nice about that kind of thing. \n\nGod speed!", "subreddit": "shopify", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sn78", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1468353287, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4siw87", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1471383408, "author": "tzse", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_4siw87"}

{"body": "Nice clean design, good choice with Shopify. \n\nYour landing page makes it seem like you only carry a dozen items (and many of them look like crack pipes as opposed to bongs, doesn't match the cheapbongs branding), whereas when you click on the menu and view all items it's clear that you carry many more items. I would opt for category boxes on the landing page to help your users find what they're looking for, with sales below the category boxes.\n\nTry not to have everything say \"sale\". If the majority of items are on sale, then isn't that the actual price? Reminds me of a sushi restaurant I used to pass by in Manhattan- their permanent sign said \"50% Off sushi!\" and their menu had every single price slashed in half. Your brand already has \"cheap\" in the name, low prices are implied.\n\nMy biggest recommendation is to see what your competitors (ones that are clearly successful, ignore the rest) are doing and then one-up them on price, offer different products, free shipping, include a \"for retailers\" link if you're looking to sell in bulk to retail stores. Online customers will shop around and if your prices and overall value are clearly the best then people will come back. For your industry the design of a website is not as important as your ability to quickly generate with users as soon as they hit the site. Look up \"trust builders on websites\" on Google and put as many trust features on your website (phone number, secure payment, guarantees, testimonials, link to your blog once you have one up and running, etc) Delineate your return policies so that they're both attractive for customers (if possible offer money back guarantee) and attractive for you (eg for items arriving in broken condition please submit an email within 24 hrs of receipt, maybe with photo proof, put a slip in the box telling them to keep the box until they know they want the product, offer store credit first if they want refunds and if they don't then offer real credit to their payment method). Happy customers turn into repeat customers.\n\nBest of luck with your business, you're off to a solid start and have taken more initiative to build something than most peopke out there.

Do not use images, footers, graphical templates, borders, symbols (bullet points are fine), shading or coloring.\n\n3. Customize each resume for the specific position using language from the job description. \u201cOne-size-fits-all\u201d does not work with applicant tracking systems. Incorporate relevant, targeted keywords and phrases for the position being sought. Be specific \u2014 i.e., \u201cAdobe Photoshop\u201d instead of \u201cimage-editing software\u201d)\n\n4. Use keywords and phrases in context. Incorporate them into descriptive achievement-oriented bullet points.\n\n5. Use Jobscan: Jobscan is a brilliant software that ranks your resume based on the keywords found in it by comparing it to the job description you are applying for.\n\n--------\n\n#The Future of Rezi and the Applicant Tracking System\n\nThe mission of Rezi is to give students the best chance of landing employment. We accomplish this by revisiting resume education with a focus on optimization for modern hiring technologies. \n\nAs our company evolves it is able to create more efficient ways to accomplish this goal. Once we've finished creating an automated way of creating our [BETA and ALPHA formats]---LINK---, we will explore custom formats to match the parsing qualifications of major ATSs. Just imagine a Lever BETA, or a Greenhouse ALPHA format.\n\n\n", "id": "d5btxj9", "subreddit": "resumes", "edited": 1468498680, "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0bv", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1468497652, "author_flair_text": "REZI.IO - for students", "link_id": "t3_4ssi7b", "author_flair_css_class": "professional", "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1471421368, "author": "rezi_io", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_4ssi7b"}

As someone who works with carbon fiber, that case honestly looks like lightweight plastic. Something has to bend to get the phone into that case, and carbon fiber doesn't do that.

{"id": "d5f65pi", "body": "First, thanks s ton for doing this. \nNow for my question/situation/life story (ok not really). \n\nI import products that I have manufactured to my specs and with my brand in China. I sell them on Amazon. I've been doing this for two years. I chose what seemed to be the perfect market and product when I started and launched to decent success quickly. Within my first 3 weeks on Amazon I made over $20,000 in sales.  \n\nUnfortunately that appeared to be my ceiling with that one product and I stayed pretty stagnate for over a year making only about $30,000 a month in sales. \n\nThen almost overnight competition flooded in with a similar but less expensive product. My sales plummeted and to stay afloat I reduced my price (and margins) significantly. In an effort to really flesh out my brand I released 6 color variations of my product as well as introduced that same similar but less expensive product my new competitors were selling. \n\nNone of the new products or colors are selling much at all (less than $5k a month combined). My original product does OK but has become ridiculously seasonal. So that's when I decided to build my efforts outside of Amazon. I had a shopify site built, turned on Adwords and paid a company to put my products on other marketplaces too (Jet, eBay, etc). \n\nNow I am suffering decreasing sales as we are in slow season on Amazon and I don't know what I'm doing anywhere else. My PPC is just throwing money away and I'm seeing no traction on the other marketplaces. \n\nI'm not giving up as I see a lot of potential with this brand. I've got s new product in production and will be releasing 3 more soon. I'm also traveling to China to design a completely new concept with one of my factories. \n\nMy business still generates between $350k and $400k per year in sales with around a 36% margin. All of those funds get reinvested. I guess at this point I'm just not sure how to get to the next level. It's just me doing everything because of the unpredictability of Amazon (too afraid to put someone on a payroll and then sales tank).\n\nWhat would you do to 10X?", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1468719352, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4t6tig", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 16, "ups": 16, "author": "fransisco_danconia", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1471479172, "parent_id": "t3_4t6tig"}

Given the typical engagement that email marketing campaigns get, you ideally want your subscriber base to be at least a few thousand strong before you start seeing predictable returns on your investment. My recommendation would be to stick with a viable schedule for now with campaigns that are optimized for retaining interest from your current subscriber base rather than driving conversions - and instead, focus on growing your list in the near term to a sizeable number. Once you get some critical mass (a few thousands), its probably more worthwhile to think about how to start generating results from those campaigns.

DNP isn't legally allowed to be injected into soil; there are complicated legal protocols for how the stuff must be handled to PREVENT introduction into soil.\nNot that his ploy that his DNP pills aren't for human consumption has any real legal basis; he hosts a forum in which logs, advice, and reports on DNP use by his customers is routinely published. Yes, the forum is on his USA-server-hosted website, like a goddam idiot. \nNot to mention that he has a youtube channel in which he appears in person to advocate DNP use for human consumption. At this point, he practically taunting the authorities to come get him. \n\nBut here we go again.

With printful/printaura you can sell wherever (shopify, your own website via woocommerce, etc) and simply use them to print and ship to your customer on demand. no setup fees, no stock...but with all the advantages of selling via your own platform (eg. getting customer data, offering discounts, setting your own prices etc.)\n\nI charge around $25 for a shirt, and using printaura to fulfil I make around a 30% profit. A lot better than you are going to get from cafepress etc...but then you have to drive all the traffic and conversions yourself, instead of tapping into the audience provided by these big sites. \n\nHope that helps anyway.

Then sell those items on eBay or Craigslist. When I was in HS/college, I would buy Nikes/Air Jordans that had limited production numbers and then sell them in the resale market for a 20%-200% profit.  \n\nBut experience wise and only with $150, I would go with creating a blog. Create your personal brand/online presence. Blog about what you're interested in. It could be business related, maybe you're a Marketing major so you could write about Marketing strategies that you have learned in school/read about. Maybe you are really into Fantasy Football, so analyze players that should be drafted higher, crunch stats to see who has been consistent over the years, etc. That will probably be hard to gain trust in, since you most likely don't have inside sources to the NFL.

For the store: Shopify is quite good and easy to use for something like this. \n\nWhatever you do, don't saturate your posts with what you're selling. Continue what you're doing and perhaps try the 80-20% rule: 80% content 20% marketing. Try to tie your products in with what a usual post would be. I wrote this pretty quick but I hope it helps.

{"id": "d5p2jci", "body": "I'm going to go against the grain of most answers:\n\nIt's a new market.  Most shop owners are risk taking entrepreneurs.  They are charging massive markups above and beyond typical retail (20-40% vs the 100-200% we're seeing) because the market is so young and fresh, people will pay it.  In many cases, entrepreneurial risk takers like to risk as little of their own money as possible, so you may be dealing with a vendor who is paying off loans, or taking money from private investors who were promised a certain level of profit.\n\nFinally, in contrary argument to everything I just said:  some of these shops are run by young, incredibly inexperienced owners.  They might not understand how to negotiate good wholesale pricing, or even source it.  They may have little to no capitol to invest in inventory, and have most of their money tied up in rent or startup costs. \n\nAnd finally:  greed.  Like in my first point, the market will pay it, so many are perfectly happy to charge that 100-200% markup.\n\nAs for the other arguments present, about bulk wholesale buying power of online only sites:  This is true of every single industry, whether you're buying books, electronics, musical instruments, clothes, video games, or whatever.  Yet most other industries are capable of finding ways to keep B+M retail pricing within 10-20% of online pricing.  So no, I don't really think that's the reason.  Especially in an industry where the majority of manufacturing/distribution is coming from China.  You don't need to buy crateloads to get a good wholesale deal.  But you do need to pony up and buy a few dozen, or sometimes hundred units.  This should be something most retailers consider when putting together their startup funds.\n\nAs for it being difficult to compete with online volume/exposure/sales:  It's really not hard to start up a shopify site and get product onto ebay.  More sales volume = more wholesale purchasing power = more profit, less stale inventory, and more growth.

In NZ. \nWe looked at Vend who I think started in NZ and are in Aus but for the first client there was no support, couldn't talk to anyone and they referred us to a 3rd party provider for website integration. that 3rd party didn't get in touch so we asked for their details but they refused and we were told they would call us but they didn't. The client ran out of patience and went to......Shopify! Vend software looks really good but we would be gambling on support. And they aren't big, so there's an element of commercial risk; growing however. We have another client who likes Vend, potentially a chain of shops. Coincidentally the Vend 3rd party (in Australia) got in touch the other day at the same time the new client wanted info. The belated response made us wonder if there was no 3rd party provider in place initially. Anyway they seem ok and the client actually rang Vend and got to talk to a human there this week.

Your site is on Shopify which for some reasons is notorious for being hard to tweak the checkout of.\n\nHowever, without having that data, here are a few thoughts as I browse the site on areas to test:\n\n- Clear main call to action on the top of the homepage (very rare and good to see)\n\n- Good that you have free shipping and use that as an incentive. \n\n- Could call to actions be added on the images below?\n\n- The display of products as a scroll seems a little messy because it is a mix of white background and images with background. Could this be straightened out a little?\n\n- What is the difference between your hangers and others? I do not see that explained very clearly on the homepage. \n\n- When I click shop now, why am I asked immediately to not go? I clearly clicked to go further into the site. \n\n- Why is there no call to action on the top of the page after I click on the first page? \n\n- Have you tested removing the email opt-ins on pages where you ask customers to buy? \n\n- Why do you have social media buttons right next to buy buttons? Could that reduce your sales?\n\n- Have you experimented with adding product descriptions to the hangers?\n\n- Do you offer any delivery time guarantees or any guarantee of other kind?\n\n- Why do you offer a 20% discount so quickly in exchange for email signup? Could that not get people to leave and then maybe forget to get back?\n\nHope that was of help. If you are interested, I can go over the site page-by-page on Skype.

He would post a pic of the new artwork/clothing (he was an artist) a few days before going live. Then when time came, he released the clothing for 24 hours only to his shopify store. Once 24 hours was up, you couldn't order that piece anymore.

{"body": "Hi Gab\n\nI review 100+ websites each year for areas which affect conversion. I see most sites have the same problems, to the point where I have created a checklist I go over whenever I review a site. \n\nHere are some things I see again and again:\n\n1. Lacking call to action. On the top of the homepage there are usually either no call to action, or so many competing against one another that it is hard to identify which is the most important. \n\n2. Little to no evidence. Usually the homepage get about 50% of the traffic, yet a lot or eCommerce owners fail to effectively explain what makes them different and back up that explanation with clear evidence like testimonials, media mentions or images explaining their processes. \n\n3. Too many distractions. This is a massive problem at checkouts in particular which tend to be filled with links taking visitors away from the checkout. The worst I see are social media links and email opt-ins right next to buying buttons. They are sure ways of loosing money.\n\n4. Limited use of data tools. Most eCommerce owners have installed Google Analytics. Few have installed enhanced Google Analytics and have identified goals which match their key performance indicators. Very rarely do I come across business owners who use heatmap tools like Hotjar. Yet, the difference between those who use data well or not, tend to be visible in their bottom line. \n\n5. Wrong technology use. I can understand why using Shopify can be very alluring. For starting business owners it can be a simple way to get started with a relatively low cost vs custom development. However, when it is hard to customise checkout you might notice that the real price is paid through a high cart abandonment rate if your site get 5,000-10,000 visitors a month. \n\nYou mention a really good point about seeing things from an outside perspective. Most of the things I point out I also bring up with students when I teach and they see them on first glance as I do. That proves that getting someone else to review your site can be highly valuable. \n\nHowever, for those that might not have that option available another simple way can be:\n\n1. Google keywords to identify competitors. \n2. Put their URL's into similarweb.com\n3. Review 2-3 competitors with more than 10,000 in monthly traffic on similarweb.com\n4. Test similar design and sales funnel elements using a A/B testing tool like VWO.com\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n", "id": "d5rksox", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1469547318, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4ucx6s", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "ups": 2, "author": "BjarneV", "edited": false, "retrieved_on": 1471693729, "parent_id": "t3_4ucx6s"}

You promote some equipment in the big banners, but with teeny-tiny buttons.\n\n* *Booklet issue*: If you can't use the booklet online then that's too bad, but I bet you can provide other quality information? \n\n* *How would I sell the booklet*: I wouldn't. I think that particular space is much too valuable and could be used to promote your great bundles in stead. Perhaps the booklet can be added as a free item to the cart upon checkout? This way it seems as if people get something extra. The booklet itself is not an incentive to purchase.\n\n* *Returning policy*: Fair point. Am I then correct in assuming that you do it in order to offer something better than competitors? In which case I withdraw my comment. \n\n* *Shopify bundles*: It's possible, though not easy. I'll send you a link to an example, though I can't explain how it works. Have the \"blog bundles\" generated any sales?\n\n* *Content inspiration*: If none of your competitors are writing blogs then that's actually great. When looking for inspiration don't limit yourself to the UK though. Also, any climbing blog can help. Just now I was thinking that it would be cool to read about your own favourite locations and visits for example? It'll show that you're really into the sport. \n\n* *Instagram collaborations*: Asking relevant accounts to mention your account in order to generate traffic. I found a great article on Reddit regarding this the other day, I'll send it to you. \n\n* *Climbing*: I'm sure you know instructors? There's one mentioned on your community page. It was just an idea. If it's unfeasible or takes too much of your time, by all accounts spend it more useful elsewhere\n\nAs for how to convert your views into cash, it's all about experimenting. Making the website more sales focused by adding and improving your call-to-actions might help. Increasing the quality of views might make a difference as well by making sure the right people are looking at you. e.g. climbers and thrill-seekers. \n\nOh, one last thing.

{"body": "Using social media is a great way to grow your Shopify store. However, each social media channel is different and you'll have to tailor your content to the specific platform and to the audience you expect to reach at that platform.\n\nFor a Shopify ecommerce site, I would recommend focusing on Instagram and Facebook. Why?\n\nInstagram: Instagram is huge for ecommerce and although it's changed slightly since they changed their algorithm, I still think it's a great way to build a community and connect organically with your followers. It's so easy to follow and unfollow someone, so your followers really hold you accountable for creating content that's interesting and worth keeping your business in their feed. \n\nPlease, whatever you do DON'T just post about products. No one wants to be bombarded with a bunch of ads/sales on social media. I recommend rarely posting about your products and focusing more on content and stories that your customers/community would like. Make sure you're participating in conversations, posting relevant photos that aren't just of products, and trying to engage with potential customers' posts as much as possible. Don't forget to respond to comments. \n\nFacebook: Facebook can be a little tricky because you essentially have to pay for people to see your content (even those who \"like\" your page). However, if you can install a Facebook Pixel on your Shopify store and start targeting similar customers to the customers you have then it can mean a lot of $$$ for you.\n\nFor example, during my initial Facebook campaign for a particular product (with less than $120 lifetime ad spend), I was able to make $1200 in 5 days. With the pixel and targeting the right interests, the delta for me on basket-size to conversion was really attractive. It cost about $12 to convert each order, and every order was over $60 in gross profit (all order sizes are &gt;$100 and margins are &gt;60%). Website clicks down to $0.02 per click. I was able to accomplish this (and will continue to expand on this with a larger budget once I'm restocked on this product...it sold out), because I knew my target customer and her interests, I had the pixel set up, and I used quality product photography and a well thought out call to action.\n\nI would recommend not focusing any time/$ on likes. You will get the likes anyway if people like your products and message.\n\nAbout me: I built a $100k+ Shopify store in less than a year with minimal advertising &lt;$1k total. I have never paid for likes on any social media channel and have 18.5k+ followers on Instagram and 4k+ likes on my Facebook business page. \n\nOne other platform I would like to recommend would be Snapchat. A LOT of ecommerce brands have been using Snapchat with success. Find out if your customers are using it, and if they are I would spend some time there. \n\n\n", "id": "d5tyu70", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1469675907, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_4uycac", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 4, "retrieved_on": 1471742515, "author": "equepreneur", "edited": false, "ups": 4, "parent_id": "t3_4uycac"}
