{"id": "d74sqtw", "body": "Appreciate the feedback. I have some comments and some questions, if you don't mind me asking. Please excuse my formatting as I'm somewhat of a Reddit noob.\n\nI'm not sure what you meant by Soy Latte western styles. I'm assuming you just mean that this isn't the \"old west\" style that you think about when you think \"western wear.\" If I'm wrong, please correct me. I guess you could say this is a niche within a niche. However, in the niche of western wear, the \"old west\" style is nonexistent anymore. My target audience is women who wear current day western wear which is basically what I have on my site. Those women are women who show horses, go to country music concerts, etc. My primary brand, Rock &amp; Roll Cowgirl is one of the bigger players in the industry. The industry is actually fairly large and there are some truly big companies in the space. I used to work for one of them.\n\nValue Proposition - My value proposition is that we're authentic. We live the lifestyle that our customers live. The giant competitors in our space are in strip malls, big cities, etc. When I worked in the business I often received complaints that the customers hated driving into the city to purchase the clothing or boots they needed. In keeping with that theme, our store is located on our 30 acre horse farm. Perhaps I am not conveying that message strongly enough. Or maybe the online customers could care less.\n\nAbove the fold content - I saw this mentioned in another reply and I happen to agree with it. However, I'm not entirely sure how to address it. To some extent (a lot of extent, really. I'm not a developer), I'm limited to what my Shopify theme allows me to do. Should I eliminate my homepage banner altogether?\n\nImage size - I was actually concerned that people were going to say that the images were too big. You kind of blew my mind by saying I should try increasing them. I feel like they are so big that they are on the verge of causing the pages to load too slowly. If you have a minute, could you clarify? I've tested on Edge, IE, and Chrome and the images seem fairly large.\n\nPhotoshoots - I would LOVE to do behind the scenes and lifestyle shots for social media and the website, but these are actually all vendor images. Eventually I want to invest in a good camera and start doing this. I slated that in as a year 2 project, to be honest.\n\nAgain, thank you for the feedback.", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": 1472691584.0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1472691298, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_50jy4e", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "retrieved_on": 1475217652, "author": "Arkmodan", "controversiality": 0, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_d74p8ag"}

There's still customizing and theming work to be done on the front end, but the hosting and most importantly, checkout process is looked after for you.\n\nImplementing a full stack e-commerce site can be technically very involved, and there are security PCI-DSS (credit card data safety) implications for your client depending on how you structure the payments on the site.  In this space Woo Commerce would be an entry level system, Magento would be a larger more enterprise grade system.  If you were to go with either of these systems, strongly consider using a managed host instead of self-hosting.  In my opinion none of the Laravel alternatives are mature enough yet to be used in production.  Self rolling your own e-commerce framework is like self rolling your own password encryption - never a good idea.\n\nIf this is your first go at an e-commerce site, I'd strongly recommend going the SaaS route.

I work at a company that specializes in Magento and our entry-level plan is $100/mo.  It can handle something with 20K products, but as a rule you'd want to bump up to the $300 plan if you plan on having much traffic.  The reason it costs so much is our hardware is pretty decent for the money (we only use SSDs for example) and our phone support is 24/7 and goes deeper into problems than most. \n\nOthers can run the hardware cheaper, but won't provide much support, which ends up shifting the cost back to development, as they'll need to set up and run the server, instead of the host - there's no real free lunch unless you know to configure server software yourself. \n\nIf you find a really good dev, things can run smoothly with Magento. And the good news is you can keep scaling more or less indefinitely.  We have customers with 1MM+ items and others with 1000s of customers a day.  And if you want some crazy custom integration or feature, the only obstacle is your dev's ability to make it happen. \n\nI would look into Magento, look into Prestashop, and run the numbers on Shopify.

(Obviously if my business grows so much that it could replace my wage id be very tempted to switch, but im staying grounded for now)\n\nI dont have really any money or sellable skills (i work in excel / data but not to any huge standard to coach, and an excel help website has been done many times).\n\nSo with little investment my initial idea is simply to setup a store on shopify and dropship some products direct from AliExpress. This is a cheap option and seems to be a relatively safe start. Once i start getting an income then i can consider building a brand / identifying better products to buy and work from there.\n\nSo a few questions:\n\n1) since im planning to dropship - epackets to us take 7-15 days, where as anything to the UK takes 20-40 days minimum. Is there any issue setting up a store selling to the USA as a uk resident? im worried selling to the UK would just lead to complaints over shipping times.\n\n2) at first im just going to run everything from my normal account - but should i be registering a business and getting a proper account if it takes off? how does this work with a second income?\n\n3) is shopify the best place to start? i wanted to do ebay but i heard they are trying to shut down dropshippers as much as possible, so this would have to be once i have some money to invest and buy stock and store.\n\n4) im struggling finding products and niches - it seems most things are done already. Im sure theres other things out there but is there any easy way of finding stuff without just browsing through AliExpress and finding things?\n\nmany thanks for any help and suggestions, i really want to make this dream a reality and would love any help.\n", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1473098413, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_519bi4", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1475358990, "author": "jasonht", "edited": false, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_519bi4"}

{"body": "My first question is are you new to e-commerce platforms or e-commerce?\n\nBecause if you are new to e-commerce, online marketing etc, I think you should start slowly with online marketplaces like amazon, ebay, etsy and so on. \n\nThat said both concepts have advantages and disadvantages.\nShopify is very easy to setup and maintain but it is not as flexible as wordpress/woocommerce solution. \n\nWP/WC solution price can be as low as 5$/month but it may also cost you way more than shopify solution based on your needs, expectation and experience.\n\nFor wp/wc solution you buy a domain name and a hosting plan. Hosting plans are starting from 5$/month and you can buy domain names about 10$/year.  Maintaining a WP site is very easy and WP community is huge.\n\nThe customization of design can be a little bit tricky if you are not familiar with WP. You can either pay a developer or you can use templates. There are a lot of great templates for WP both free and paid which are very easy to customize.\nBut as you are very new to WP I suggest using a paid template with 24/7 customer support. It will make things easier for you.\n\nWC plugin is free and you can find a lot of free WP plugins but sometimes using paid plugins are easier. So you should consider the costs of plugins as well.\n\nHere is the WC supported payment gateways. \n---LINK---\nThey are very easy to integrate.\n\nPersonally I prefer to use shopify (and similar platforms) for e-commerce sites and wordpress for non e-commerce sites (blogs and etc). \n\nBut before building my own e-commerce sites I  start with online marketplaces like amazon, ebay and etc. They already have traffic, setup and initial costs (time, money, effort) and TTM (Time to Market) is very very low and testing/validating your idea is easier in this platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "d7be5yr", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1473164512, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_51dyzf", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1475381406, "author": "realpatrickstar", "edited": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_51dyzf"}

{"body": "&gt;  I have come to the conclusion through feedback on Reddit and research that it will be very difficult for me to compete in the US market **as I just cannot compete with the pricing.** \n\nYou would be correct, if people were only interested in buying things based on price. That would mean instead of coke or pepsi, people would simply buy the store generic brand based on price and price alone.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that what separates you and enables you to charge more, and get more sales at the same time is the community that you build by truly \"getting\" your audience and engaging them.\n\n&gt; 150 people a day through Adwords and Social media but still NO sales.\n\nFor the adwords part, make sure that the keywords you are bidding on, are used by visitors who are ready to purchase the product now.\n\nThe keywords you are buying are search terms, meaning if they type in \"australian stationery\" or \"cool stationery items\" or \"how to ___ with stationery\" They are not interested in buying, but are interested in learning. Instead find search terms to indicate that they want to buy now.\n\n\nThe second way and the easiest to do is to show that you know who they are and that they are welcomed by letting that be shown on your site.\n\nHere is a video from Cliff Enico, that talks about people not buying things based on their needs or wants, but rather their passions and fears.\n\n---LINK---\n\nSo If you can change the perspective from \"I have these stationery products to sell\" to \"Stationery is more than just paper and ink, its a lifestyle\" you can sell visitors and keep them coming back.\n\n#0) See what your competitors are up to\n\nGo to your search engine of choice and search:\n\n**your niche + \" powered by shopify \"** ex: \"stationery powered by shopify\"\n\nYou will find alot of stores already using shopify that can give you some good insight on good things that you may not have thought to include on your site that would add value and confidence in your brand.\n\nFrom a quick browse, I found a store that was showing users their stationery kits on their homepage slider: \n\n---LINK---\n\n\n#1) Get  A Memorable &amp; Colorful Logo\nThe logo means so much for a brand. The logo can often sell the product, and becomes the ambassador of all that your business stands for.\n\n#2) Navigation\n\nI would remove the stream, and the home link and instead take all the links from shop and append those to the nav.\n\n#3) Swap out the photo for a lifestyle brand HQ photo.\nUse the 5 second rule: basically our attention spans can be pretty short and instead of reading content, we mostly scan to see what we are looking for. So try to see if you can show what your business is conveying within 5 seconds of browsing.\n\nThe best shots [have already been voted up]---LINK---\n\nOn instagram and pinterest the very best stationery images have been voted in. Its the one's that caught viewers eyes from a stream of endless content. \n\nIf you have stationery on hand, see if you can recreate a few of these photo scenes for your brand photos. Also try to make them different or better.\n\nIf you want to take it a step further see if you can use the [top voted examples]---LINK--- to recreate product listing images.\n\nShow slider images of:* bullet journals, art journals, washi tape, stickers, stencils and more.* \n\n#4)  Typography/Fonts\nBullet journaling has something to do with typography, so I would suggest using some more [handwritten style fonts]---LINK--- for your site.\n\n#5) Color Scheme\nThis will have to be based somewhat on your logo design, but you should pick a color scheme for your brand. [Color schemes]---LINK--- help to convey what mood that your business has.\n\nIf you already have an idea of what base color that you want to use, [colourlovers]---LINK--- has an awesome search engine that shows you color \npalettes to give you ideas on how to color your site/brand.\n\n#6) Inject Personality\nAdding a little bit of that quirky fun personality into your product descriptions and website can help go a long way.\n\n#7) Social\nPlan out your stories in advance, and then have some photo shoots. If you are crunched for time, coming up with good descriptions and photos and hashtags can be challenging.\n\nTaken some time to plan in advance, can help you to artfully make use of several spaces in your own home, rented airbnb or local area with nice scenery to take 20-40 different photos at a sitting to post on different days.\n\nExample: I would start including some handwritten trendy blurbs (stylized) for instagram, because its very popular, and can bring eyes to your site.\n\nEx: ---LINK---\n\nI would show people [interesting things]---LINK--- that [can be made with washitape]---LINK---\n\n\n[Later](later.com) can help you to schedule these out, so that you aren't having to remember the descriptions that you came up with and, ifttt can help you take your post from instagram and place them on twitter and facebook.\n\n#8) Blogging\nMake it a habit to blog about bullet journaling, and how to help people with both basic and advanced topics, and maybe tie it into different important life events and how bullet journals can help.\n\nOne of the things that pays off in the long run, is having content that is shareable on social from your blog, so that you build rapport, trust and potential customers.

Great for getting a store up on the cheap, but starts to fail when you need something more than a typical Browse &gt; Add to Cart &gt; Checkout workflow.\n\nWordPress is a blogging platform, first and foremost, and to squeeze out any extra functionality you're looking at quite an undertaking. Themes vary wildly from one another, ranging from vanilla WordPress skins (i.e. just another blog theme) to full on webstores that support WooCommerce and/or other popular conversion plugins.\n\nThere really isn't limit to what a theme (or plugin) can do in WordPress, which is great, but its also kind of a trap for people new to the platform. You really have to do a lot of legwork to find a theme that suits your needs. You might need to combine a theme and a handful of plugins, too.\n\nThat being said, its almost always a better idea to hire a web development studio to build you a custom theme that has all the features you require. If you value your time at a reasonable rate, it will also be the \"cheaper\" route to take. Dropping $2k-5k on a custom theme may sound like a huge investment, but when you compare it to the amount of time you will personally need to sink in order to get your site up and running you'll probably come out on top.\n\nAnd you'll actually get what you need!\n\n---\n\nNow I shall rant about Envato and their refuse heap of a theme repository, Theme Forest.\n\nThey suck. The quality of the code you will get off of an Envato site is going to be of the lowest caliber. There's a reason its so dang cheap! Something about open marketplaces with zero curation leads to what can only be considered abuse. Hell I think some of the themes on there are straight up scams.\n\nEven the much touted Genesis theme is a pile of crap. And the price they are charging should be considered criminal. Its a joke, really.\n\nIn my experience, if you try and customize their themes even in a slight way, you're in for a bad time. The vast majority of the themes seem to be built by web *designers* (i.e. not *developers*, people who cannot code). They copy-paste and hack together code that barely works for their demo, upload it to the Envato marketplace, and then say its ready for production use. Balderdash!\n\nHonestly, you're probably stuck with whatever formatting the theme \"developer\" (see, my bias is showing) thought looked best in PhotoShop. Either find a theme that better fits your requirements, or take what you got.\n\n\n", "subreddit": "Wordpress", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhjq", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1473289235, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_51nyq1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 4, "ups": 4, "author": "seventyeightmm", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1475431112, "parent_id": "t3_51nyq1"}

If you want to add other things later, you can always change the platform you operate on later.\n\nI guess I'd say the main benefit of Shopify over WooCommerce is that it's designed for people who really don't know tech. There's a support person you can e-mail if you have issues, and they have built-in features that are usually things you have to manually setup in Woocommerce. That said, you still have to do that with some of the more advanced stuff in Shopify, and if you ahve someone else setting up your WooCommerce store, they're doing that all for you anyway.\n\nI prefer Woocommerce because it's more customisable, more flexible, and free. I self-host my websites, so I just have to click a few buttons and I have a new store going. As someone else mentioned, it can be a bit fiddly around inventory and also with shipping. (But my experience with Shopify wasn't a lot better tbh).\n\n$15-25k does seem a bit high to me. Not to spam the sub, but I have a friend who works with a lot of small retail businesses that I believe can get you setup for a lot less than that. Her company + portfolio is [here]---LINK--- - downside is they're Australian-based, but upside is the strength of the $USD right now will get you a good price.\n\nIn terms of marketing, I generally wouldn't recommend getting your web design guys to do your marketing for you - it's a nice value-add service for them to sell, but it's so easy to sell marketing services that don't deliver. You really want to start learning how to do this yourself - at least at a basic level so that when you talk to marketers you understand what it is that they're doing for you, and the real value they offer.\n\nWhat's your product? If it's this popular on Amazon, it should be pretty easy to put together some sharable content that you can start spreading around the Internet with the view of going viral. If you'd rather not say in a public post, hit me up with a DM and I can talk you through some ideas for how you might do this.

{"id": "d7ds548", "body": "I highly recommend against this. Reasons: \n\n1. Cost is too damn high. How many months of support will they be giving you? At least a year for that rate. \n\n2. If you're not a WordPress person, you are creating an umbilical cord to them where you will always need them for support. That means any updating or fixing, you'll need them unless you teach yourself how to do it. \n\n3. Hire someone specifically for whatever you need, don't do a la carte. If your dentist offered you a nose and a boob job, would you do it? Every specialty needs a specialist, same goes for web stuff.\n\n4. Your customers don't really care about the bells and whistles of your site, they just care that it looks nice and works. You just need a basic Shopify site to do this. Do you think your current customers are buying because your amazon store is so awesome?? No, they're because of your product. The way a store looks is just icing on the cake. \n\nI agree with Ross, you should start off slow and small and build up from there. Use that money to get more product or invest in development, whatever. But by god, don't spend that much on a website. $5K should be more than enough. And you just need one person, not a whole firm. \n\nYou should hire a firm when you bigger, and more established, but not at the outset. One local person that is good with WordPress should be enough. \n\nI've used both WordPress and Shopify and if I were you, I would go back to Shopify. I know you will probably hate that idea, but if you really, really, really just sit down and try building the site yourself, you'll realize it's very easy. I got my teenage sister to build a Shopify site, and it was up and running in 2 hours. Was it an amazing site? Hell no, but people could buy from the site, and that's what matters.\n\nWordpress is great if you know what you're doing, and you want a highly customized store, but it's usually a pain in the ass to get it just right. Adding one thing may break something else. Wordpress is very much like taking a puzzle and cutting the edges of a piece to make it fit. This means you'll always need someone fixing your site. If I asked my teenage sister to build a store with WordPress, she wouldn't be able to do it with a lot of grit and determination. Even me, someone that can do all of the custom WordPress work, would rather just go with Shopify, install the extra plugins, and be done with it. \n\nCustomization for a website, especially at the beginning, is not worth it. Just get the basics (store, blog, contact page, etc), and only add/upgrade stuff only when you absolutely have to. \n\nHope this helps.

Also if they buy the gift for a good friend that jokes back and forth with them, wouldn't they subtlely be calling their friend or family member a loser also?\n\nthis logo/domain only makes sense if the visitors are there to buy \"gifts\" for their enemies. Similar to Shipyourenemiesglitter.com phenomenon that swept the web not to long ago.\n\nIf that's the case, then you marketing and your products should all be like the \"Self-Deprecating/Gifts for Enemies\" because very few people will buy from that brand name otherwise as a loyal \"loser\" customer.\n\nIf you were going for the \"Cards against Humanity\" kind of play it makes sense, but CAH follows a very specific rule: Its shocking, outlandish, but like all great comedy it never punches downward to the intended audience. Most prank gifts that people buy for friends and family are humorous and harmless. But sending someone a gift like the ones in the \"enemy\" category would cross the line.\n\nHere a very popular video about prank gift ideas that sort of show what Im saying:\n---LINK---\n\n\n## Problem #3: People might like some of the sayings/quotes but **may not want to wear them as shirts**. (Do people wear white after labor day?) Consider going with mugs more heavily, or have some \"safer\"/ dark humorous shirts that wont bring up bad conversations all the time.\n\n\n## Problem #4 Your Instagram:\n---LINK---\n\nFirst things first, **you need to unfollow those people.**\nMost top instagram acccounts don't even have that many follows.\n\nTwo its REALLY apparent that the people that follow you do so because you have followed them.\nhaving that follower to followed ratio shows a lack of credibility. Anyone trying to feel out your brand could quickly gather that 1000 people weren't interested in your content, because you only have 4 photos with and average of about 30 likes per photo and only 1 comment spread between them.\n\nEvery photo that you posted on IG has a different style and tone to it, which doesn't help solidify your brand. Once you get a better feel of the kind of audience that you are selling to, you can create some better photos by researching what your audience wants to see.\n\n######   For the \"Gifts For Enemies\" Audience:\n\n---LINK---\n\n\n######   For the \"Dark Humor/Ironic/Witty/Prank\" Audiences (You'll need a new domain name/brand for this though)\n\n---LINK---\n\nLuckily for you, on instagram there is a lack of #prankgift content, so you could definitely be well known for that niche (ex: prank mugs/shirts):\n\n---LINK---\n\nYour success on instagram will be determined by using the right combination of related hashtags and good photos/witty descriptions.\n\nI would also add new content on youtube, and facebook, certain subreddits, (maybe youtube) because you need to find out where your audience hangs out/what your audience demographic is.\n\nOne of the easier ways to do that is to check youtube comments for the most popular videos of this sort to understand who is most likely to buy.\n", "id": "d7eak4v", "subreddit": "reviewmyshopify", "edited": 1473349020.0, "subreddit_id": "t5_3g5ir", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1473348801, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_51r5ry", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "DurableSoul", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1475453280, "parent_id": "t3_51r5ry"}

Almost nobody is sitting around anymore trying to write code to, say, allow their OS to detect their mouse. However, this has only freed programmers to work on more interesting and engaging problems.\n\nEvery single decade you see programmers working in contexts that previously didn't exist... mainframes, operating systems, consumer desktop software, the web, mobile, 3D, etc. It's not going to stop, and it's never going to become \"easy\".\n\nProgramming is literally thinking, and that can't be changed. Even with drag-and-drop interfaces, all you're replacing is the basic syntax. If you want to do anything complex at all, you're going to have think in terms of if-then statements, variables, loops, functions, etc. Every drag-and-drop programming interface includes these features out of necessity, and the ones that don't are woefully underpowered and require programmers to fill the gaps. Take Shopify for example. If you want a basic site, it's easy to drag and drop. If you want anything else, you've gotta learn to code or browse the Shopify store to buy a plugin written by... a programmer.\n\nThe only thing we can automate or make easy is very simple stuff.

{"body": "[Shopify provides one of the most comprehensive guides.]---LINK--- - Drop shipping works the same regardless of the country you are working in. But, there are some obvious key considerations to make the model work within your geographical area and culture:\n\n* Finding suppliers/manufacturers willing to dropship may be more difficult. Dropshipping is still a pretty unfamiliar with a lot of the business community, so finding people who are aware of how it works and willing to do it may require some extensive relationship development / face-to-face meetings. \n\n*  Finding suppliers willing to maintain dropshiping may difficult. There is no doubt come countries/cultures have ruthless business cultures. Screening your potential partners to ensure they are suitable (not just willing) to work with you is also critical.\n\n* Providing consistency through your supply chain. Drop shipping relies fundamentally on the consistency of the supply chain to get the product to the consumer. If your country can't provide consistency to get products to consumers, you need to find away to surmount this challenge. Otherwise, you'll lose current and future customers as products arrive late, are damaged, lost etc.\n\n* Your local legal obligations. You need to ensure your business fully complies with local laws when using the drop shipping model. Whilst this sounds obvious, and it is, it can be a little complicated when you start dealing with returns etc. Having solid agreements with your dropshipping partner (e.g. the supplier) is critical.\n\nNot extensive, but I hope that pointed you in the right direction.", "id": "d7iqvbq", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1473630946, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_529fr3", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "retrieved_on": 1475567724, "author": "TeresDevelopment", "edited": false, "ups": 3, "parent_id": "t3_529fr3"}

First, the dimensions of the package and the destination address type (commercial vs. residential) will play a large roll in your overall rates. If you're shipping small items that will fit in a USPS Small Flat Rate box that *might* be your best choice for the time being. However, there are probably other USPS shipping solutions (media mail, standard package, etc) that might get you a slightly better rate. Second, shipping volume plays a major role in your rates from UPS, FedEx, DHL, etc. If you aren't shipping hundreds of medium/large packages that are over 10 pounds per month UPS and FedEx probably isn't the way to go. \n\nRealistically, since you're using Wix and shipping small, lightweight packages I would suggest calculating your worst case (highest) flat rate cost (possibly $5.90 if you decide to use USPS Small Flat Rate boxes), roll that into the product price, and offer free shipping on the item(s). \n\nIf you plan on shipping a decent number of orders per month to customers in many different states Wix might not be the best ecommerce solution for your dad. I would definitely look into Shopify, Magento, Woocommerce, etc., as they will be able to offer live carrier-calculated shipping rates based on the origin zip code and destination zip code. \n\nSign up with ShipStation.com (free trial) and Stamps.com (free trial) and start doing some research on the different shipping methods and the costs associated with them.

{"body": "Niche is certainly interesting but here is my critique:\n\n1) Product pages use the same product description for multiple products (for instance iphone cases), this will get penalized in Google Search rankings. Use unique product descriptions for each product. Try to be descriptive and sell the product using the description!\n\n2) Home page is extremely product focused with absolutely no emotional text or visual content. This page is not only to feature your products but also convey why a customer should explore your page. Give them your differentiator up front. \n\n3) Get rid of the .myshopify.com if you want to be treated seriously. Keep it if you are just tailoring to family and friends, but rid yourself of this if you are trying to market to the outside world. Looks more professional without the URL extension.\n\n4) About Us page has very minimal content. It doesn't really convey the story of the brand or the people behind it. Mention something about why wood, the quality of the products, who you are and what makes you a wood expert, etc. Pictures and/or video content here would also really help.\n\n5) No pictures of any of the products actually being worn or used. This might be difficult to get actual photos as you are dropshipping, but there are plenty of people who will easily photoshop a bowtie or watch onto a model photo to show off the wearability of the items. This really helps people visualize the products on them. Great photos for the home page, product pages, and any kind of off-site or on-site marketing as well.\n\n6) I would try to create more pages/content. Blog posting is a great way to bring about traffic to your site, start a blog and try to post consistently, even if it's just once every week or two, it's a start. A shipping page would be helpful to know your delivery &amp; return policies. A Frequently Asked Questions page would be good to get some easy answers. A contact us page would be helpful so a customer can get in contact with you in case they have a question they need answered or problem. All of these pages help the customer in their buying decision and create trust.\n\nGood luck my friend!

{"body": "I concur with what mikerinard said about Etsy having a ready to use traffic source. Online shopper are already on Etsy and that's what contributed to your initial sales. Moving away from that to Shopify (or any other platform) you now have to get your own traffic source.\n\nRemember that these aren't shopping platforms, they provide you with a platform that shoppers can visit and buy from you. There is a great [case study]---LINK--- by Corey detailing a case study he did by starting a Shopify store to sell a completely new product. I think you might pick up a thing or two about marketing from that post.\n\nEssentially grow your audience on Twitter, Facebook and even Reddit (since you're already on here). I generally don't encourage ad spend in the beginning especially for eCommerce as it can be hard for beginners to get the targeting right and probably just results in zero ROI.\n\nDon't worry so much about SEO either, as a developer I'm sure you've gone through all the list of technical SEO and that it's ready to be picked up by Google. Do a little content marketing (blog posts, social media posts with original content) centered around the interests of your target audience, not necessarily about your product.\n\nLet me know if you need help, I'm keen to help new merchants gain traffic and conversions.

What is the purpose of your site? Are you purely displaying your work, or do you also want to sell goods/services through the site? Keep these things in mind when shopping around. These types of services may seem reasonably priced for some of your portfolio needs, but could get more difficult to set up and a lot more expensive to fit all of your needs.\n\nThe other big tip I have is to spend a good amount of time on your branding. There's nothing more cringeworthy to me than a portfolio site that doesn't look appealing, or that has an incoherent brand.

The internet has really good resources, it's just a matter of filtering through all the content to find good nuggets.

{"body": "Thank you for the compliment about the SEO. I've already hit page 2 of Google for a few of my targeted search queries. And to give you an idea of how awesome that is, I just registered the domain on Sep 5th. \n\nI chose to build the site live instead of password protected or on a development server. That way I could build rank even while I was developing it. Creating the pages and setting up the permalink structure and meta-tags were the first thing I did, even before the content was loaded. Then I submitted the sitemap to Webmasters. By the time Google caught up and indexed the site, I already had the content loaded. I wouldn't recommend that strategy for every site, but if the content isn't super sensitive, it's a good way to go. I also had the majority of the information ready to go before starting the development too, which allowed me to develop it quick.\n\n**Regarding your question about the effectiveness of self-managed affiliate programs:** I've seen some very successful ones. Like anything, it comes down to the execution. Personally, I don't think setting it up is the hard part anymore, especially with these Shopify apps. At this point, some of the affiliate software I reviewed have the technical curve down to a one-click install.\n\nI think the hard parts of running a successful affiliate program - the areas that companies either win or fail at - are recruiting affiliates, educating them how to best sell their products/services, and providing them the tools and resources to do it. Unfortunately, some of the self-managed affiliate software companies lean towards the \"if you build it, they will come\" attitude in their marketing, but that's not usually the case. \n\nI'm not sure how much I want to get into the subject of \"how to run a successful affiliate marketing program\" on ShopAffiliateApps.com. I'd like to focus on the technical comparisons of the software and be the best at that, because that's what I felt the industry needed most. At least, that's what I needed when I was doing my research. I could always expand down the road though, or potentially partner with an existing affiliate educational program that's up to par. For now though, I'm going to expand the reviews to include screenshots and video screencasts of the software backends, which is another thing I would have loved to have seen when doing my research, without having to install each app or schedule a demo with the company. A few minute video going through the backend of each software would've be perfect.

{"id": "d7mfwyg", "body": "Well said! I'm gonna add a few points that may not be widely known (or keeps getting brought up) from when we had our website up:\n\n* Almost all the major online shops I've seen use Shopify or Volusion. Their support emails are hosted by the same. Emails **DO** get lost or not received. Technical server shit. Second follow up email should always be sent before complaining.\n\n* 48 hours is **NOT** a long time to wait for a response. A lot of y'all seem to forget that most online interactions used to take 48hr+. If you get a response within 24 hours, that's dope. But give them time; sale time is almost always guaranteed a delayed response time.\n\n* Sale time means increased outgoing packages. If your package is damaged or missing, **CONTACT THE VENDOR**! Don't come here immediately to bitch and moan that the package carrier broke your shit but you're placing blame on the vendor.\n\n* If you don't like a response from a vendor, **BE CIVIL**. Don't demand shit, especially free shit. It pisses people right off when you immediately resort to, *\"If I don't get so-and-so my way, I'm gonna ruin you with reviews on ECR, ECF, and my friends on Facebook\"*. If it's an online vendor, believe me, losing you is not going to make them lose a wink of sleep at night no matter how much you may usually order.\n\n* Send good vendors a thank you email! Can you imagine being part of a support team for these websites? No one ever contacts support unless there's a problem. A continuous stream of emails/chats coming in problem after problem, issue after issue? It's a constant stream of bad shit that they gotta make into a good thing.

{"body": "dropshipping is selling goods without buying inventory. Basically if you goto a website like ---LINK--- they sell products at almost wholesale cost. So you make a website using shopify or woocommerce, find products that are selling well, and sell those products on your website at a higher price. When someone visiting your store purchases the item from you, you simply use his contact info and money to purchase the item on aliexpress and ship it directly to him. This works well if you can market your store properly. People usually dont go hunting down the best price on things, and having a good site with good marketing can lead to tons of people buying products from you. The margains are not that great, because you cannot really buy in bulk, but you can definitely make some decent money if you find some things that are selling really well, or you know how to market well. The best type of marketing currently imo is geared towards facebook ads, instagram posts / paid posts, and google adwords.\n\nOverall dropshipping is a great way to get your feet wet, as you dont have to invest a lot of money to get started.

Etsy is also notoriously bad about informing sellers about issues when they have them. A few months ago there was a huge issue of credit card payments not being processed- it took over a week for some sellers to receive payments. This of course means they had to wait to be allowed to ship any orders. Etsy didn't tell customers this was happening, and so there was a lot of confusion from buyers not knowing why their item hasn't shipped and it was entirely in the hands of the sellers to figure out how to deal with it :P That's just recent shenanigans. If you ever peruse  /r/etsy I feel like there are always new issues popping up each week.\n\nOh and personally, Etsy is really cookie cutter.

{"body": "Hi,\n\nAmazon and Shopify owner here! \n\n- How tiring it is. Your work day is never done, and I constantly strive to improve and better the business. Any slight customer criticism or scamming is taken personally which you should NEVER do - I can't wait to be big enough to hire a cs rep to deal with the 1% who make you question why you are doing this\n\n- My biggest mistake was registering for VAT right when I first set up. You don't need to do this until you earn \u00a383000+ so for my first trading year I paid unnecessary VAT. It could have been an expensive mistake, but luckily I only wasted around \u00a3300 so a lesson learnt!\n\n- The biggest growth for me was finding my core product that flew off the shelves quicker than I could restock! I sell fashion accessories and sourced a cute penguin print scarf in October 2014. In November 2015 John Lewis released their Monty penguin Christmas advert and the rest is history. My amazon listing for this product is still in the top 10 of its category and selling well (despite pesky Chinese factories selling at less than I can buy, this product is now my loss leader)\n\n- The key focus for me is if you get your listing looking right, the product sells. Attractive photographs showing details and different views and a lengthy description that has good keywords will go far\n\n- I still have my full time job so a typical day begins at 6am when I get ready for 'real' work. I get home at around 5pm and cook/clean/decompress until about 8pm and then work until approx 12am depending on order volume (the more to pick and pack, the longer it takes!). I usually browse my listings on Amazon to ensure I have the buy box, update descriptions, look for mistakes etc.\nMy next goal is registering as a Ltd and quitting my day job to focus 100% on growing my own \ud83d\ude0a\n\nGood luck and enjoy - it will be a rocky ride full of learning experiences, but the rush is well worth it!\n\n \n", "id": "d7ofp8q", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1473977278, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_52y26r", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 4, "ups": 4, "author": "pandoo19", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1475715203, "parent_id": "t3_52y26r"}

Here's a hint as to why they fail: everyone knows someone who wants to start a t-shirt business, has a t-shirt business, or has failed at the t-shirt business.\n\nIt's easy to convince yourself of success. You have great ideas for designs (clever, funny, awesome), and you see you can buy a blank t-shirt for $7.99 a pop and then turn around after you've put a print on it and sell it for $19.99. And, you've got some *fantastic* ideas for shirt designs. Easy money, right?\n\nYou'll print a few, and get a few friends to buy them, and give away quite a few more to \"build awareness.\"\n\nBut really, no one knows you, no one knows your designs, no one cares. Everyone already has way too many t-shirts, so you are trying to sell to the few people who just really like t-shirts. And those few people typically already have places they go for them (Woot, physical stores, favorite Etsy or Shopify shops). \n\nTo get your foot in the door, you start competing on pricing, and once you do that, the game is already over. Once you compete on price, you have a million competitors that are indistinguishable.\n\nIn business, the typical way to make it easy on yourself is to come up with something 10x better than the competition. That's difficult to do with t-shirts.

White you can easily get for $2-3 each. \n\nThen screen printing, if you're lucky to live in an area of cheap labor *cough* Asia, you can get this done for less than 50 cents a shirt, provided you have screen printing equipment, and don't mind hiring staff, but you also need space. It's fun to do the first few times solo, but in volume it sucks. You need about 50-100 minimum per size, so imagine S, M, L, for an average compaign. \n\nMarketing, facebook ad, what's popular is pokemon. Steal someones pokemon design from Deviantart, or maybe if you're generous, go on fiver and ask for something original, and maybe pay out total of $50 to a good artist. the thing is, the artist can probably do the same thing as you. You then either create bullshit groups on facebook like \"pokemon for 90's kids\" or payout for placement and you get a fan base. What you do then is fake promotions, sales and such, the typical scummy stuff. Shipping here is up to you, usually you want to kind of aim it like \"buy one item, get the 2nd item half off.\" so you can justify $14.99-18.99 + $4-6.99 shipping. Otherwise you'll have to run free shipping promotion on shirts, which means $14.99 check out, hope they're in the USA and first class it, which is $3.60 w/ discount to anywhere in USA (1 shirt falls under 16 oz.)\n\nThen you kinda hope the quality is ok. If you used shopify, that's fees. If you used paypal, theres fees. So you're working now on every $100 earned = 7 shirts.

{"id": "d7q0psw", "body": "I second what /r/seodoctorapp said about SEO. \n\nOne thing I noticed is that you have the Good Good Products dropdrop menu in your nav bar. It leads to an overview of each product. \n\nI would really recommend having this menu go directly to an overview of your products where you can buy each. Get people to the sales pitch faster. If they've arrived at your site it's most likely because they already are a fan (saw you on social) or they were searching for a particular kind of product/came there through a back link from a site. \n\nWhat's worse: From your /about the product pages, there is no link (that I could find) that goes to your actual products. Ie; where people can buy the products. \nThis page contains info, but not a link to the products.\n---LINK--- \n\nSame goes for your (beautiful) landing page: When I click Shop now I'm taken to a very confusing mix of banners:\n---LINK---\nI'd rather just see an overview of your product types, or better yet; all the products in your store.\n\nAs I'm writing this I realise you technically only have 4 types of products. I would split them into separate products so the store feels more substantial. Make the flavors their own products. That allows customers to visually discover the flavors when they browse your store. It also means you can link directly to the product from your blogs/pages/posts and with time see which product is getting the most traffic. \n\nThe Google URL builder is your best friend there!\n\nI also find your body text overall to be a bit small, even on my massive display.\n\nYou might also benefit from removing the large bar from the top of every page. Your landing page is gorgeous, but once I'm on your site let the screen contain what I'm looking for.\n\nIn addition I think your site might benefit from a simpler overview. Show all your products on the first page. Right now every product feels like such an investment with ALL that text on each product. I sell $200 science-inspired custom dresses made-to-order and find that my customers want the dresses to have a substantial read. I think people looking for your products have already been sold on it somewhere else; make their choice easy and let them buy your product without having to search for the buy button. \n\nWhich makes it sound like I'm trashing your site, which I'm 100% not: It's so incredibly beautiful! Design is really fantastic, the photography is stunning and your social media shows lots of promise. \n\nI think my best advice is to simplify and make the sales funnel stronger. Which also means giving a shopping option from every page. Especially your big 'Why Good Good' page: ---LINK---\n\nAt the bottom of it; have a button that says 'Shop Now' and lead it to your products.

Mainly b/c i wanted to learn abt social media marketing. Il try my best to ans your questions \n\n1. Email the suppliers and ask them if they offer dropshipping. Pretty much as simple as that. For howwedrink.com I use a app called oberlo. Basically, it lets me pick products of aliexpres and add them on my site. No need to email. Keep in mind, im using shopify for the website. Through oberlo The invoice shows your company name. So my invoice will say \"Howwedrink.com\". \n\n2. On the product description I simply state shipping may take up to 2-3 weeks. This part sucks about dropshipping. Basically say something like \"Some items are also made-to-order and/or are shipping internationally. The best things are worth waiting for!\"\n\n3. As far as privacy policy, terms and conditions? Me personally, I wouldnt worry about that till you start getting some sales/attention. In other words, I dont know lol. \n\n4.

{"body": "Yeah so many companies with like, a basic AF Wordpress website and a shopify plugin. Clearly 90% are just riding the wave - they're not innovators, they are opportunists. \n\nSoylent had the original idea. So they get points for that. Then Ambronite and Huel and possibly others decided the product itself needed to be better quality, so they also genuinely added something to humanity's collective achievements. Lastly all these other companies just targeting slightly different market segments but essentially offering the same blend of maltodextrin et al. \n\nI know that's an over-simplification because there are interesting ideas like Meal Squares or the 'Twenny' bar from Joylent (which I love the idea of except it's still full of corn starch).\n\nMaltodextrin is a small enzymatic transformation away from being just dextrose which is sugar. It can become sugar in your mouth just from contact with saliva it is THAT eager to be sugar. The other ingredients may bring down the 'GI' score but it doesn't mean it doesn't have the effect it has on your endocrine system. If you put sugar on a beef steak you'll still get a sugar rush!! Insulin will spike - either they are lying or they don't understand how the glycemic index works. Or GI is yet another inadequate idea in the health food industry. \n\nThe fact that there are so few non-maltodextrin options means that Huel is worth bringing in to Australia. Or, as you say, producing here. The Huel team has given up - I asked them about it and they said if I figure out how they can import it to Australia they'll look into it. But I mean - how piss poor is that? If that's what you're telling your customers you don't deserve their business. If I'm going to go to all of that trouble I may as well start my own brand. I can use Wordpress too you know! \n\nWhoever does it just needs the following:\n- formula that doesn't violate copyright/patents\n- online presence, including social media\n- a willing food manufacturer in Australia\n- enough dough for the first batch / a solid enough brand for a licensing agreement. Either way maybe a Kickstarter/other crowd sourced funds? Probably need it either way because to solidify the position of a brand you need patent protection.

{"body": "There seem to be three good ways to go about integrating additions to heritage buildings:\n\n1. Use very similar styles and materials, to match the original design as much as possible. Where possible, aspects like symmetry and the visibility of the original structure are maintained. The Lord Elgin is a good example of this.\n\n2. Build something that is completely different and modern, so that it appears as a standalone building, even if it's connected to the original. This generally works better when the heritage building is smaller, like the Bank of Canada building and the Shopify building.\n\n3. Use a lot of glass, so that most of the original structure is kept intact and visible. The Museum of Nature and the West Block renovations are examples of that.\n\n(Obviously, approach #3 isn't viable for the Chateau Laurier, since they want to build something substantial.)\n\nThe Chateau Laurier expansion seems stuck between both possible approaches. The styles are similar, but in a very vague way (grey walls, brown copper roof). It also detracts from the visibility of the original building, though not from the front. So, it looks like a separate building that isn't part of the hotel, but not quite distinct enough to serve as a complement to the original building. Instead, it's trying to emulate, remix and modernize the original design, which is the worst approach; it feels like the architect wanted to bring in their own vision (i.e., typical modern condo architecture), but added a thin veneer of similitude to \"respect\" the Chateau's history.\n\nIt makes me wonder if the outcry would have been less if they had gone with a more unique design that could serve as a premiere example of modern architecture. Of course, that can be risky as well: just look at the [addition to the Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton from the 1950's]---LINK--- as an example of \"modern\" design clashing with the original.

{"body": "Okay so I'm just going to slap you with a whole fuckload of shit and hopefully something I say sticks with you.\n\nThere are a thousand ways that you can take these steps, some people will criticise some things I say but the point of my comment is entirely to give you choices and at the end of the day you need to pick something that you enjoy.\n\nSo I'll break these down between active and passive income groups and then conclude on what in my opinion is the best path for someone like yourself.\n\nACTIVE INCOME:\n\nSo this is the kind of thing that a lot of Nomads will do before setting off, mainly due to the increased job security that comes with most of these items.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is find a skill you are interested in doing, then, a resource that can help you develop that skill set.\n\n1. Wed Development / programming - This is a popular choice for a lot of people as it seems to be the best profession where employers will allow you to go remote, that's not to say others won't, however, 30% of programmers work remotely at some stage and that's a pretty big number. Development can be overwhelming if you don't go to the right places to study it, but it has a very active online community where most of the hard stuff can be answered in just a quick question to the right people. If you chose this path you can expect to be in the field within the next 12 months and if you let your employer know you'd eventually like to go remote you have a higher chance of doing so once you've proven your ability to work well on your own. How to study - Get on ---LINK--- for a start, it offers university style lectures that I would compare with the education I got in University for commerce. you'll also want to sign up to freecodecamp and codeacademy. These have been proven resources that have given birth to digitial nomad developers.\n\n2. Online Marketing - tons of information out there on this, I won't get into it as I don't like to preach about things I haven't done, however, it seems to be quite lucrative for nomads that I have met that have done it. how to study - again, lynda. its a paid website but often you can get a free access through a local library. Other than that there are plenty of other courses out there.\n\n3. Teaching - this is something that a ton of us native English speakers take for granted. You can teach English and get paid for it in most countries (Russia, Poland, SEA). Most places won't even want to see a degree so you already have the skills to do this now, just google search for overseas jobs. The only issue here is you are stuck with countries that want english teachers, having said that, its not exactly a small selection.\n\n4. Data Entry / Freelancing / Odd jobs - this is all the other non major categories, go on upwork.com and advertise your skillset, also try selling a skill on fiverr.com, some people get money just holding up names while wearing dumb outfits. Sky really is the limit here.\n\n5. Ask your current boss - I'm an accountant that is learning to code, I have worked with large investment banks right down to churches and private schools, since accounting isn't something you always need to be present for I was able to find some remote work in the field just by marketing my skills.\n\n6. Country specific work - Finland has ski resorts, so do many cold countries and they often hire people to come in and work during peak season. just apply for seasonal jobs. As an australian I know a ton of people that do summer camps in America and go on to work in canadian ski resorts. I've also met people that have worked on cruise ships teaching toga classes etc.\n\nPASSIVE INCOME:\n\nSome people may catagorize some of these things as active, but its debateable.\n\n1. Writing - This mainly relates to KDP / Kindle Direct Publishing. ---LINK---\nJust read this and you'll get the basic jist, if your books aren't a complete pile of shit you can usually make a few dollars\n\n2. Dropshipping - This is basically selling someone elses products online, you set up a shopify store, call suppliers until you find one that has a good product at a cheap wholesale price, you resell that product on your website and market the fucking shit out of it. I think people overstate the earnings through this method but it seems to work for some dudes/ladies. Just google it to find out more, plenty of free resources.\n\n3. FBA - Its essentially drop shipping but you take on more risk and reward. you buy a product from alibaba.com or another chinese wholesale website and ship your stock to amazon and sell it through the amazon store. plenty of resources through a quick google search on this.\n\n4. Skill selling - I haven't met many nomads that do this but its a beautiful way to make easy money, simply advertise a skill like you normally would (even if you dont have it) and outsource the contract to another nomad or developer, etc. Then when they finish the work you send it to the client at a marked up price. Like drop shipping these is a bit of risk with this but im sure you can work it out.\n\n5. Investing - Exactly how it sounds, options trading is the cheapest path to entry but if you dont develop your skills with this you'll do yourself some damage if you arbitrarily trade randomly based on whims.\n\n6. Entertain - I'll group this stuff, youtube, blogging, podcasts, anything that you share some form of entertainment or information that you can monetise through ads, try to avoid travel blogs as this seems to be everyones first choice and its hard to set yourself apart in this market.\n\n(MY OPINION) BEST PATH.\n\nSet a goal with active income, give yourself an 18 month path between now and boarding a plane, pick a skill, learn it, 40 hours a week in your spare time (if you really want this you can find that time). Make sure to network like fuck, get on LinkedIn.\n\nIf you are passionate about the choice people will realise. It took me 10 days to go from joining my first development website to being invited by a director of a web developer company to his office to network with my cities most prominent programmers. I'm a highschool dropout with a commerce degree so believe me when I say that anything is fucking possible if you block out distractions and immerse yourself in it.\n\nHowever, on this side of this, start building a passive income portfolio, do dropshipping with ebay instead of shopify, anything to get a couple of extra bucks, especially if you have debt, you need to abolish it before you go away or youll stress out if your income isn't certain but those bank payments are. \n\nBefore you go test yourself, go on upwork or advertise your skill and get 3 jobs start to finish before you think about leaving, People think they can just 'do it' when they are over there but you'd be a really big fucking idiot to not at least try to test yourself before its too late to see if you can or not.\n\nLike most people here, start in Chiang Mai until you can stand on your feet and then the sky is the limit, for a luxury life in thailand you need about 10k for one year. that means if you can make 20k a year remotely you can hop on a plane without too much uncertainty.\n\nWhen you are overseas keep doing your active job but try to build up a passive portfolio, just to cover overheads, if you can make 1000 a month passively you never really need to worry about having a roof over your head anymore and can go longer stretches without work / contracts.\n\nAnyway dude different strokes for different folks but there is one similarity between all nomads. It doesn't matter what you do, if you want this lifestyle you'll find a way.\n\nGood luck.\n\n", "id": "d7ueul0", "subreddit": "digitalnomad", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2r9w0", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1474367772, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_53m51j", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 35, "retrieved_on": 1475866435, "author": "Qerbside", "edited": false, "ups": 35, "parent_id": "t3_53m51j"}

Do not justify text\n* Currency converter dropdown is cool\n* Like the footer a lot.\n* Under meet our team, you should be able to click on the photos\n* On the meet our team page the images should be floated to the left with a margin around them.

Something to peak their interest.\n* The sort by isn't particularly helpful. \"Sort by price\" is a good way for people to sort by lowest first and decide they don't like the prices and leave. It would be nice if there were additional categories under it, Example: sort by lampshades, pillows, artwork, plataes, bowls, etc. It's actually kind of strange that you can't break them down further.\n* Went through the rest of the catalog main pages. I don't like the giant \"EYEBALL\" that shows up. I would say View and Add to cart as just plain text\n* When you click add to cart you have to first confirm adding it to the cart. Generally you want to make it easier to add items to the cart than removing them. If you can remove the second confirmation that would be better. And then the window says you can continue shopping or go to your cart. There should be a link in that window to the cart. It might just be my eyes but it seems like perhaps there is supposed to be but its not working. The \"head to your cart\" part seems like it might be in a slightly different color but doesn't link anywhere.\n* The separators are the visual glue of the look of the site. What about adding a thin padded border around all the photos? I think that would unite the look \n* Product page, I don't like having to scroll down to see things. Float the image to the left and bring that whole bottom section up (the price and the description). Then implement a lightbox so I can click to see the image bigger\n* Love the related products. So many stores fail to do that. It seems to be pretty accurate from what I can tell as far as recommending things similar to the product you're looking at\n* Contact, pretty basic but ok Personally I would remove Contact and FAQ from the top menu completely and just have it in the footer\n* Globally I'd make the font size a couple steps bigger\n* Your logo is your logo, but it irks my OCD that there isn't a period after the abbreviation \"St.\" and that homeware has a lowercase \"h\" while the St Ives before it makes it seem like it should be in sentence case\n* Why is there a \"Shop by Vendor\" with only one item? Remove it its just confusing\n* I love love love the cart and checkout flow. I went up to the point of entering my information and I like the looks of it. Only suggestion on the cart page would be to duplicate the check out button on the top of the page.\n\nOverall, if you built this yourself this is AWESOME. There isn't anything inherently wrong with it but there are improvements that could be made to make your conversions and the overall experience better.\n\nThere is nothing blatantly obvious that steers people to what you want them to do from the homepage. The photos are great but so what, do you want people to click them? There should be something that draws them in. It's akin to inviting people over for dinner and then just setting food down at the end of the table. If this is a store you need to have a \"Shop Now!\" button that is a little bold.\nI'd say right below the featured products section, a wide button that expands the whole way with a \"Shop Now\" and a cart of some sort. People love that damn cliche shopping cart icon. And as someone mentioned, if you can write over the slideshow pictures, I'd just write in a big large font SHOP COLLECTIONS or something.\n\nAlso I hope none of this comes off badly, I'm waiting for dinner to cook and needed to kill 30 minutes so I was happy to do this and not ranting or anything or trying to be mean at all.\n\nEDIT: Also I agree with the one comment about the photos. I think they could be better if they all matched the slideshow photos and by that I mean \"stage\" everything. If you are selling a bowl, place it at a nice place setting on a really nice colorful placemat. And crop it so that the photos is zoomed in on what you're actually buying but you still get the idea of how the bowl would look and actually be used.\n", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "controversiality": 0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1474406058, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_53nm2n", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 2, "retrieved_on": 1475885339, "author": "starcresc", "edited": false, "ups": 2, "parent_id": "t3_53nm2n"}

{"id": "d7vnfnd", "body": "Wordpress is my go to platform. Assuming there isn't much customization to the products or the site itself you could also look into shopify or bigcommerce. However WP will be the cheapest of the 3 to get started. You'll just want to add woocommerce to the back end of WP and you're off to the races. \n\nFor themes you might want to check out flatsome. It's not my personal favorite but it's #1 ranked e-commerce theme on themeforest. Key thing I suggest when looking at theme are the volume of transactions (the more the better) and when it was last updated (you want an active development team). If you find a theme you really like but it hasn't been updated since 2014 you might find it doesn't work down the road. \n\nRegardless of what theme you purchase there is usually a need to tweak a few things here and there. It's pretty rare a WP theme will give you exactly everything you need right out of the box. If you're not picky and want to just work within the wireframe they provide then it's a perfect solution. \n\nThe other great thing about WP is that pretty much anything you need help with, is available on Google. Chances are if you have a question someone else has already asked it/answered it. So finding supportive information is really easy. \n\nGood luck!\n\nedit: although i said flatsome isn't my favorite theme, I have built some websites using it and they turned out pretty nice IMO.

The puck is passed more than a canadian Hockey team with no chance of winning. When I call I get sent to phone numbers that either don'd egxhist or have nothing to do with my issue. I believe that there is fraud here to uncover and malfeasance to expose. Thank god I have forty thousand loyal twitter followers to make this go viral. I will pay for 500K more, hire seth rogan to do a viral video ad and frankly do whatever it takes to make sure that this discontinues. One fewer Music student will lose his free ride to UNM for music, but I should still be able to afford the other three I pay full rides for. Four years of promotion, 7 websites with your links as the only clothing outlet I  mess with, millions of links to you, and I cant even talk to a real person who actually works for karmaloop. This story is quickly becoming much bigger than the fact that you never compensated me for all my labor and business I brought you (I have a great deal of analytics I will save for the story). I am over the fact that you have broken your agreement with me, I am now convinced that you may not honor your affiliate program at all.  My loyal southeastern distribution hub of your products will surely be on board to switching away to a more reputable company. You should be ashamed of yourself. After the press release and the article we can talk again when the barristers become involved.\n\n\nAbdias Noskin\nEvents and Things, LLC\nLocal 13 Productions\nTribe 6\nLovelab\nFull Time Machine\nBarsOverBeats Records\nThe Beat Junky\nTommy Boy Records\n\nAbdias Shaw &lt;abdiasshaw@gmail.com&gt;\n\t\n8:36 AM (3 minutes ago)\n\t\nto Support\nI have repeatedly done all requested of me yet never seen any result. You can see through all the emails that I have forwarded over the past four years that there has been no movement whatsoever make good on your agreeement. It havs bbecome obvious that I backed the wrong horse, and that you have never planned of giving me the credits I was promised. I already stopped spending thousands of dollars personally, but as a successgul party promoter I am in an excellent position to support your direct competition and answer interviews about my experience. I think I am most done with the ridiculousness that is apparently your organization who when I finally reached someone today told me that there were some Karmaloop buyers somewhere in the building but she had no idea and didn't think the number I had been given was the right one anyway. The third internal wrong, the third internal wrong number in one service call. If I wanted to deal with this kind of absurd hnonsense I would have affiliated myself with a twelve year old who has his own shopify store.\n\nAbdias Noskin\nParty Promoter.

We add screen shots and step by step instructions on pretty much anything they might need to change themselves and point out exactly what they should not touch. We export to PDF and send it to them over email. Sometimes we miss things and they give us a call, at which time we just add it to the guide, slap a new version on it, re-export and re-send. One nice thing about the current workflow is that we can pretty much reuse guides for similar sites, since they hold a lot of the same functionalities but we do go out of our way to customize if for their specific use-case and most screenshots are from the clients actual site. \n\nI would love to have a more technologically advanced way of providing docs but some clients honestly prefer a PDF.

I was so overwhelmed by everything. The thumbnail-sized images make it impossible for any one thing to catch my eye. Sure, variety is great, but let the user drill down to where she wants to go. Don't overwhelm with options right off the bat. To fix this, use more of a magazine-style homepage layout. Get some lifestyle images, make one a hero image with a message across it. Pick a few products you a) really like b) represent the brand c) have plenty of inventory and d) have good margins, and feature them on the homepage. Use larger images instead of thumbnails. Talking 3-9 products max. Use category teasers. Use subcategories. You have a lot of tops, so break them down further - whatever makes sense to your assortment. Again, avoid that overwhelming number of choices. Have an ad-sized image teaser with the text \"Retro Tops\" or something like that (instead of \"view all tshirts\" or something boring).\n\n2. The logo's gotta go. It's really bad, I'm sorry. Do anything. Go to CreativeMarket.com and buy a template. Pick a new font. Anything... just make it clean and kill that shadow. Please.\n\n3. The popup -- I don't think your 50% is an innately bad idea, I just think it's too much, literally and figuratively. It's too much for my eyes... maybe class that thing up a little bit with cleaner colors. And it's also literally too much. 50% off is a joke, and it makes me think your brand is a joke.\n\n4. The \"sale\" mentality. I'd kill that 20% off thing and make THAT what you put in your hold-on popup box, or even 10%. The free shipping is great. But since you already have kind of this garage-sale look to your site, the huge discounts only add to that negative connotation. Homepage redesign will help with this mentality as well.\n\nSo, to recap: add sub-categories to help organize your products instead of the \"here's everything!\" approach, put up a new homepage layout that emphasizes a brand feel rather than product thumbs, and chill out on the sale vibe. People will pay for what they think is cool - you've just got to present it that way. Remember, they don't want 100 options, they want 10 really good ones.\n\nFollowup thought: no one really cares if you're going to keep adding new products if they aren't attracted to what you've already got. Use your first impression as a chance to win them over with your current selection. After you've won them with a sale or email signup, then you can hit them with email marketing, etc, to SHOW them you're getting new stuff.

{"id": "d855v6e", "body": "Hi reddit - I'm the founder of [Free Sunglass Company]---LINK--- and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. I put together this FAQ below to start. Hope it helps. If you want to contact me directly, you can reach me at jd@freesunglasscompany.com.\n\n**What is Free Sunglass Company?**\n\nI created an online sunglass shop because I constantly found myself wishing I had a bigger collection to choose from, but the problem is, quality shades are really expensive and the selection at \"flash fashion\" stores and outlets is typically limited. I set out to change that, and didn't stop until I found a way to get quality, fashionable shades in your hands at a fraction of the usual price. \n\n**What are you offering?**\n\nA stylish and trendy pair of sunglasses for free, shipped anywhere in the world. We currently offer classic aviators, trendy wooden-framed glasses, and many other models in a variety of colors. We have sunglasses for the special ladies in your life, too!\n\n**How's the price so low? What's the catch?**\n\nThere's NO catch - All of our sunglasses are free. Browse our collection, select the style you like, and begin the checkout process. We use the trusted e-commerce platform Shopify to process all order transactions. Shipping is insured.\n\n**Additional Discounts:**\n\nFree Sunglass Company offers a multi-pair discount which starts at $18 for 2 pairs ($9/per pair) and gets as low as $7/per pair. You can see our full pricing chart on [our pricing page]---LINK--- \n\n**How long does it take to deliver?**\n\nCurrently, we are able to offer such a great price on our sunglasses because of the average time to ship. \nOrder processing takes 1-3 days and our average delivery time is 2-3 weeks to the US. International orders can take 2-4 weeks. We are looking to make future improvements in this area! \n\n**Will you be adding more sunglasses?**\n\nYES! We are currently adding new models and new colors, all of which will continue to be free with the flat $10 shipping fee. Join the mailing list for occasional deals and inventory updates!\n\n\n**Quick links:**\n\n* [Men's Sunglasses]---LINK---\n\n* [Women's Sunglasses]---LINK---\n\n* [Pricing]---LINK---\n\n* [Shipping &amp; Delivery]---LINK---\n\n* [Refund Policy]---LINK---\n", "subreddit": "promos", "edited": 1475041557.0, "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4w1", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1475041244, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_54uony", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "_jdams", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1476135143, "parent_id": "t3_54uony"}

{"body": "Hi Ricardo,\n\nThanks for taking the time to reply and for your suggestions. I've done my best to show my thought process on the points you've made below.\n\n&gt;Simplify. What is the point of having a \"Home\" link on your menu, what does it tell me? Ditch it. Up your categories from Shop+ to the main menu, if they are hidden odds are I won't be able to find about them. In my opinion quilts are not throws and should not be bundled together.\n\nI thought about removing the home link, but I think it helps the computer illiterate potential customers you mentioned. It gives them their bearings and they know they can always reset by using that link. I also thought about leaving the Shop+ list automatically expanded - so users can see the product categories without having to click. The counter argument in my head to this was that it pushes the fold further down, so users can no longer see the \"Shop\" title below the hero image - and may not realise there is more content further down the page. AB testing for this kind of thing would be great, but I'm not quite there yet.\n\n&gt;The search bar is so hard to find, can you make it more visible? This is not high priority since you have a small catalog, but still most e-commerce's have easy access to the search bar.\n\nGood point, I'll think about what I can do with this but it's currently quite low down on the loooong list of improvements I need to make to the site :)\n\n&gt;Contacting you is hard, can you give me just an email or a direct phone together with service hours? Can you show this to customers directly on the footer or the top Nav besides cart?\n\nI *think* the contact form is pretty straightforward and it gets some use, but I could be wrong and you're right that some people would much rather call. I think it could definitely be easier to find in the first place too (currently just in the footer isn't great).\n\n&gt;Experiment with different price points.\n\nI'm currently thinking about the best way to do this. For bigger orders I'm losing money on shipping, because I wanted to keep the checkout process as simple as possible with just two delivery options, whereas delivery costs can vary from \u00a33.95 to \u00a313 depending on the weight of the parcel. Big P&amp;P costs that can't be calculated until checkout can be a big turnoff, so it's about finding a balance really between distributing the extra shipping costs as fairly as possible and keeping the checkout experience as smooth as possible.\n\n&gt; I'm a e-commerce owner and online shopping veteran and still have problems navigating and following the check out process\n\nWas there anything in particular that caused you friction on the checkout? It's the default checkout that came with the Shopify theme I started off with. To be honest I'm a bit scared of editing it!\n\n&gt; Are the 2.5k visits from actual people or search engines?\n\nThat was the total number of visits. Users arriving from search engines is quite a bit lower, and from organic searches even lower - so that's what I'm currently working on with more keyword research.\n\nThanks for your help, much appreciated!", "id": "d85igqx", "subreddit": "ecommerce", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhin", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1475073141, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_53hzyp", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "hoo-gah_homewares", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1476144373, "parent_id": "t1_d7tbfdp"}

{"body": "Yes! From what I've sensed from the market.. (these numbers will look difficult since I know that Sub-Tees are more expensive to print POD) the price range goes like this for higher dollar t-shirts:  The max for a T-shirt with a great design (and yours are) should be $25, but your goal in business should be trying to get the max price to be $19.95 and anything less is icing on the cake.  Then you get people buying 2 or 3.  For a zip-up hoodie with a great graphic, $50 max, preferably $45 or $39.95 max.  \n\nONE WAY to deal with this, is to keep working your pipeline to reduce costs, though this requires more cash investment for you - to avoid this... THE OTHER alternative is to have a low-dollar line of shirts - which means having shirts that are not all-over prints as well. Then you can have your all-over shirts at a higher price (like $27.95.. or $29.95 max).  If you did some shirts with just a front print, you could use someplace like TeeLaunch which does a shirt for $8.50, which you could sell for $19.95.\nI think that's your best course... develop 8-10 shirts quickly at a low price, and when a customer hits your page, they should see like 60% - 70% of the cheaper shirts.  You'r site looks great, and they will butter up, then when they see the all-over shirts near $30 they will think of it as a premium option, instead of being boxed out by the prices.", "id": "d85r1v5", "subreddit": "shopify", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sn78", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1475083686, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_52qhbc", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "rezzo7", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1476150762, "parent_id": "t1_d85d4fl"}

If you want to contact me directly, you can reach me at jd@freesunglasscompany.com.\n\n\n**What is Free Sunglass Company?**\n\nI created an online sunglass shop because I constantly found myself wishing I had a bigger collection to choose from, but the problem is, quality shades are really expensive and the selection at \"flash fashion\" stores and outlets is typically limited. I set out to change that, and didn't stop until I found a way to get quality, fashionable shades in your hands at a fraction of the usual price. \n\n**What are you offering?**\n\nA stylish and trendy pair of sunglasses for free, shipped anywhere in the world. We currently offer classic aviators, trendy wooden-framed glasses, and many other models in a variety of colors. We have sunglasses for the special ladies in your life, too!\n\n**How's the price so low? What's the catch?**\n\nThere's NO catch - All of our sunglasses are free. Browse our collection, select the style you like, and begin the checkout process. We use the trusted e-commerce platform Shopify to process all order transactions. Shipping is insured.\n\n**Additional Discounts:**\n\nFree Sunglass Company offers a multi-pair discount which starts at $18 for 2 pairs ($9/per pair) and gets as low as $7/per pair. You can see our full pricing chart on [our pricing page]---LINK--- \n\n**How long does it take to deliver?**\n\nCurrently, we are able to offer such a great price on our sunglasses because of the average time to ship. \nOrder processing takes 1-3 days and our average delivery time is 2-3 weeks to the US. International orders can take 2-4 weeks. We are looking to make future improvements in this area! \n\n**Will you be adding more sunglasses?**\n\nYES! We are currently adding new models and new colors, all of which will continue to be free with the flat $10 shipping fee. Join the mailing list for occasional deals and inventory updates!\n\n\n**Quick links:**\n\n* [Men's Sunglasses]---LINK---\n\n* [Women's Sunglasses]---LINK---\n\n* [Pricing]---LINK---\n\n* [Shipping &amp; Delivery]---LINK---\n\n* [Refund Policy]---LINK---\n", "subreddit": "promos", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4w1", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1475096657, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_54ymd7", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 0, "ups": 0, "author": "_jdams", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1476158462, "parent_id": "t3_54ymd7"}

If you want to contact me directly, you can reach me at jd@freesunglasscompany.com.\n\n\n**What is Free Sunglass Company?**\n\nI created an online sunglass shop because I constantly found myself wishing I had a bigger collection to choose from, but the problem is, quality shades are really expensive and the selection at \"flash fashion\" stores and outlets is typically limited. I set out to change that, and didn't stop until I found a way to get quality, fashionable shades in your hands at a fraction of the usual price. \n\n**What are you offering?**\n\nA stylish and trendy pair of sunglasses for free, shipped anywhere in the world. We currently offer classic aviators, trendy wooden-framed glasses, and many other models in a variety of colors. We have sunglasses for the special ladies in your life, too!\n\n**How's the price so low? What's the catch?**\n\nThere's NO catch - All of our sunglasses are free. Browse our collection, select the style you like, and begin the checkout process. We use the trusted e-commerce platform Shopify to process all order transactions. Shipping is insured.\n\n**Additional Discounts:**\n\nFree Sunglass Company offers a multi-pair discount which starts at $18 for 2 pairs ($9/per pair) and gets as low as $7/per pair. You can see our full pricing chart on [our pricing page]---LINK--- \n\n**How long does it take to deliver?**\n\nCurrently, we are able to offer such a great price on our sunglasses because of the average time to ship. \nOrder processing takes 1-3 days and our average delivery time is 2-3 weeks to the US. International orders can take 2-4 weeks. We are looking to make future improvements in this area! \n\n**Will you be adding more sunglasses?**\n\nYES! We are currently adding new models and new colors, all of which will continue to be free with the flat $10 shipping fee. Join the mailing list for occasional deals and inventory updates!\n\n\n**Quick links:**\n\n* [Men's Sunglasses]---LINK---\n\n* [Women's Sunglasses]---LINK---\n\n* [Pricing]---LINK---\n\n* [Shipping &amp; Delivery]---LINK---\n\n* [Refund Policy]---LINK---\n", "subreddit": "promos", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2r4w1", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1475117958, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_5506yq", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 1, "ups": 1, "author": "_jdams", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1476168323, "parent_id": "t3_5506yq"}

Being passionate about what I do also leads me to hang out in online communities (outside the standard social media spectrum) that are focused on what I do and like, and that helps as well because even if ypure not selling directly (or indirectly) word gets around.\n\nI've spent a good chunk of the rest of the time looking at SEO. Google bases it's search listing order on relevance and importance as well as keywords. So it's not just figuring out the keywords that appeal to your customer base to get them out there initially but figuring out how to get them to interact with it to increase your search visibility. Mine is far from perfect and continues to be a work in progress.\n\nI also ran a very focused Google Adwords campaign near the beginning (once I figured out the best possible keywords for my ads), but found it to be costing as much as it was bringing in at the time. So I'll probably approach and re-evaluate in the future, but it's on hold for now because my market is incredibly saturated and it gets very costly very fast. Other products mileage will probably vary with that, as well.\n\nIt took about 4 months to get social media marketing to match the amount of views Adwords was getting me, but I'm there now.

{"id": "d871j4p", "body": "Good post with a lot of valid points. Thanks for sharing, i have a few of the same gripes myself.\n\nEvery ecomm platform is going to have its strengths and weaknesses. You can pick apart every platform pretty easily after running any store for even a short while.\n\nShopify's aim is to provide the best general solution for ecomm store owners, from entry level business to enterprise. They do a lot to make getting going and managing day to day business as painless as possible, and to your points not everyone shares the same general needs. But under the hood it is way more powerful than what the admin interface alone allows.\n\nId just like to touch on a few points. The first being that almost every bit of data ( product, order, customer, etc ) can be manipulated - there just isn't a button or field for everything in the UI. I believe they do this to balance ease of use versus common needs. Editing a customers order can be done on the command line with a line or two of code, but not everyone is a developer and comfortable doing this. So, i do agree with you some things can be frustrating when the functionality exists but there isnt a button for everyone to easily use.\n\nThe best way to help improve the platform is by supplying feedback. We've seen a number of our requests make it into the platform, and it gets better everyday. Your post would be a great one for their feedback forum.\n\nAlso, their are pricing plan tiers for good reason, like any other software as a service platform. You can upgrade to unlock more features, get better rates, yada yada.\n\nAn example would be your point of collections and bundles. I think having a rules based system for collections is a major strength of the platform. However the functionality you described can be achieved on Plus, known as Shopify Scripts. So you can determine bundles, BOGOs, tiered pricing etc pretty easily, but you do have to pay to play. Shopify Plus isn't cheap, but its certainly way more cost effective than Demandware, Netsuite, Mozu, and many other enterprise platforms. Magento may be open source, but at scale you will still be in same ballpark after accounting for servers, security, ssl, maintenance and upgrades. So it is priced competitively.\n\nThe costs for different tiers would be justified by how much you need the features. If you're doing thousands of orders Shopify Advanced or Plus may very well pay for themselves. If you're doing hundreds of thousands or millions a year, it may be beneficial to bring on a developer who can customize or automate things a bit for you ( if you are not a developer yourself, in which case check out the API docs ).\n\nAnd one thing with some apps - yeah they might not be plug and play with a custom shop, but they are also built for the masses. But if you have a custom site and don't have a developer on staff, you can also contact these developers and they will often offer decent rates to help with implementation to help make their app work within your shop.

{"id": "d876sjr", "body": "Hi cheesefan,\n\nYou have some great questions. \n\nFirst, if you plan to work in the professional web development world, you will almost certainly never be creating websites with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and no back-end CMS to manage it. \n\nWhat you will use depends greatly on where you go to work. \n\nIf you're working for an agency, you will likely end up using something like Wordpress, Drupal, or any other major CMS. There are others that cater specifically to ecommerce as well like Shopify and Magento. Most agencies will have one CMS that they use for all of their clients, but some may choose different ones depending on what's needed. The agency I work for has developed their own CMS and we use that for all of our clients. We prefer that because we have 100% control over everything and can easily build out functionality depending on what's needed.\n\nIf you end up working for a company's internal team, they may still be using a CMS or they may be using an internally built system that's completely custom. Sometimes these systems tie into CRMs or ERP systems so they can be very complex, high-maintenance, and sometimes just really old.\n\nEither way, having experience working with different CMS platforms is extremely valuable. \n\nAs a back-end developer, I'm usually given a template that's been coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and it's my job to split this up into the pieces that work with our CMS. That usually means moving the header and footer into their own files, updating the navigation to be built using a database table, and hooking up other data driven components - a blog or products page for example.\n\nThe easiest CMS to get started with is Wordpress. It has a huge community and there are a lot of resources out there to teach you how to build sites with it. That said, I'm a fan of custom development, but that's a lot harder to come by in the working world.", "subreddit": "web_design", "edited": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1m", "stickied": false, "gilded": 0, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1475171793, "author_flair_text": null, "link_id": "t3_552x16", "author_flair_css_class": null, "score": 3, "ups": 3, "author": "irtriskit", "controversiality": 0, "retrieved_on": 1476186451, "parent_id": "t3_552x16"}

I also updated all of my business social media to direct to aquartertotea.com instead of aquartertotea.etsy.com. I've also since swapped social media links to sales, message board posts and the like to just reflect only my Shopify site -- even though (most)  coupon codes work on both sites (Shopify has more freedom than Etsy on what you can do with those, so some of them only run on one site). Etsy also gives you spot on your 'About' page to add a website, and my site is posted there as well. My understanding is, as long as you're not actively using Etsy to encourage sales off Etsy it doesn't violate the TOS.\n\nI could honestly spend more on advertising than I do on Facebook, and with the holidays ramping up, I'll probably start. I'm still learning things a bit myself and this with be my first Christmas season with the site. But typically, I tend to only sponsor the posts that are trending within the followers on my page (or sales I'm running) and only for 3-5 days at I time. I find a lot of diminishing returns with Facebook advertising, because I have a very targeted group of keywords with which I've had the best results. \n\nI definitely recommend it! Depending on average cost/item, you might find yourself spending less on fees with Shopify than Etsy, even with the monthly fee on Shopify. They also give you a two week free trial, which is a perfect time to start setting up your site, so you're ready to go as soon as the monthly bill kicks in.\n\nIt takes a little more computer know how, but not that much. They have a robust template and app/plugin library. One thing to note, there might be some unexpected expenses when initially setting up. Shopify uses Liquid for all of its templating, including packing slips and receipts (and the defaults are ugly). I bought templates for those because I lacked a coding foundation in Ruby (Liquid is written in Ruby) and found myself getting incredibly frustrated. I've since picked up a couple of tricks, and can get through the rest of it with the support boards, but still think it's a giant pain to work with.
